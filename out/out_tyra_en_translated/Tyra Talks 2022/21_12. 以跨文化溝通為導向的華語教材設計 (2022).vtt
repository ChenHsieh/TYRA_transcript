00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Thank you for the introduction, and thank you to the audience.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
I don't know how everyone is doing in the different time zones,

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
but I believe it's Sunday,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
and it's almost noon.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Thank you.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I hope you can give me some feedback later.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Let me start by saying that what I'm going to share today

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
is probably not the level of a seminar,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
because it's a research project under development.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
The rest of it is still ongoing,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
so what I'm going to share with you later will be a preliminary version.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
In addition, because it's still under development,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
my email will be announced later,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
or this video will be released on YouTube, right?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
It will be released on YouTube,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
so you are welcome to contact me.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
But what I'm sharing today hasn't been published yet.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
The last one is about to be published,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
so that's fine.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
So please don't quote it first.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
But welcome to give me some advice.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, let's share my screen now.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm going to share my screen with you today.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
What I'm going to share with you today

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
is what I've been doing all along,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
which is a cross-cultural textbook.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Can you all see it?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
This is a design and study of a Chinese textbook

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
with cross-cultural communication as its direction.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
First of all, I want to share these two sentences with you.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
One is what Hafiz said.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
He said that if we don't have conflicts in this communication,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
frankly, it's hard for us to wake up to some things,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
and it's hard for us to figure out some things about our own culture.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
In addition, this is Mr. Gu Baili.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
He was also one of the instructors in my doctoral class.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
He said that when we do language learning and teaching today,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
we shouldn't say language and culture.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Many of our courses are now called language and culture.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
He said that we shouldn't say that.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Why?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Because in fact, language and culture cannot be separated.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
So he said that language should be in the culture.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So he thinks that culture is bigger.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Language is just a little bit of a cultural expression.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
So he thinks that the expression of language and culture is not in a language system.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
In fact, it extends to the actual common purpose of language.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Next, I want to share with you why I did this research.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
It started about 20 years ago.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
When I was very young, I translated this book.

03:03.000 --> 03:13.000
It is also the first academic paper to study the students of the Chinese Language Center in Taiwan.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
The cultural adaptation of these foreign students after they came to Taiwan.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
At that time, this scholar was Sister Grace Boyce.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
She was a professor of social studies.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
She was also a nun.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
She was very concerned about the adaptation of these foreign students at the time.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
So she did a lot of research.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
This research was done very well.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
She also won a prize at that time.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So she published it.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
I was very honored to be able to translate this book and this paper.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
When I finished translating this paper,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
it gave me a great personal shock and inspiration.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
It turned out that cultural adaptation is such a difficult thing.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
At the end of this report,

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
she gave a lot of suggestions on how to help foreign students adapt to their mother tongue.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Of course, it includes the suggestions of the residents themselves.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
How to be mentally prepared.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
How to change your attitude.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
How to integrate this culture before and after.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
But she also gave some suggestions to the language center and teachers.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
This was a very fresh thing for me at the time.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
She said that the language center also needs to pay attention to the special needs of foreign students.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
We need to help them improve their self-level and culture.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
And those who are mentally prepared may be in a target country.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Of course, it was in Taiwan at the time.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
There may be some cultural resurgence.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
She thinks that language teachers should also be fully prepared.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
Because they are often the first foreign students to come into close contact with their mother tongue.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
So she should become a very rich resource to help these foreign students.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
So that they can successfully achieve a local cultural adaptation and public communication.

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
The biggest inspiration that this book gave me was that language teachers are not just teaching languages.

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
What she wants to help is cultural adaptation and help her students communicate properly.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So I think that language teachers probably also need some ability to cross the cultural ocean.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
To be able to do a good job of native teaching.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
This is my opening.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Next, we will continue to share my research motivation and background.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
First of all, in our foreign language learning, we will learn from first language to second language.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Or the second second language.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Some people will say this is language 3.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
What we often notice is the distance between our mother tongue and our target language.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
For example, the Romanian language may be very close.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
The Romanian language itself may be very close.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
For example, if a French person wants to learn Chinese, the language distance is very far.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
We often use this standard to measure language learning.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And measure the difficulty of language learning.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
But in fact, we often ignore that the real purpose of language learning is to communicate.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
In fact, every language contains the culture behind it.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
Is the distance from L1 to L2 equal to the distance of the target language culture?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
In fact, sometimes it is not.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
So the difficulty of language is not equal to the distance of culture.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
For example, maybe learning a similar German and English.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
If we are a person with a mother tongue.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Maybe on the cultural distance.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
We have not done a deep analysis of this.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Maybe we are on the cultural understanding of German countries.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
In fact, it may be more difficult than, for example, the target language of American English.

07:23.000 --> 07:31.000
In recent years, I have been paying a lot of attention to the part of cross-cultural learning.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
Therefore, language learning should pay attention to deep learning.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
That is, to be able to understand the culture of the target language.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
In order to achieve the purpose of proper communication.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
So this is also a motivation for me to write.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Next, among the Chinese textbooks mainly in Taiwan.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
We see that most of them are still learning in the original.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Among them are some spiritual cultural points.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
In fact, I feel that the Chinese textbooks in the United States are almost the same.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
But they may have some textbooks.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
For example, the IC textbook will particularly emphasize the so-called cultural highlight part.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
In addition, we often say that the cultural class in the center of the original cultural class.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It is also often noticed that a professor of old culture.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Including, for example, the study of calligraphy that everyone often sees.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Or it is based on a variety of precepts.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
There will be some related activities of wrapping zongzi.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
In addition, there is also the so-called information culture of this textbook.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
For example, the information of the goal and the country.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Including local people, history, geography.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
For example, the Center for International Studies will hold a course on Taiwan today.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
Discuss some of Taiwan's news or social phenomena.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
For example, this kind of textbook is very familiar to everyone.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Today's Taiwan is probably one of these informational cultural textbooks.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
In recent years, there have also been some textbooks with a cross-cultural understanding as the orientation.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
For example, this is the teacher of our university.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
This is the Taiwan comic book.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Taiwan comic book has a way of writing.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It is a kind of cultural contrast.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
For example, the theme is sports.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
What is the sport that Taiwanese people like?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
What is the sport that Americans like?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
What is your participation in sports?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It makes a cross-cultural comparison and explanation.

09:37.000 --> 09:46.000
However, the textbooks written specifically for this kind of behavior culture in cross-cultural communication are still very lacking.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
So we see that many of our Chinese students may come to Taiwan.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
He still has no way.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Even if his language ability is very high, there is still no way to achieve a purpose of physical communication.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
So this set of textbooks, I hope that the starting point of textbooks that can be developed is like this.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
It can help learners to have early awareness and understanding.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
It may face a cross-cultural difficulty caused by cultural differences.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
And reduce the anxiety and confusion in real communication.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
In the end, it reaches the goal of being able to communicate with native speakers.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
In other words, it is a two-way good communication.

10:28.000 --> 10:41.000
In other words, foreign students can communicate with native speakers at ease based on their own understanding of cultural differences.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
At the same time, his own speech can also make native speakers feel at ease and not be offended.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Let's take a quick look at this part of the theory.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
First is Helmer Lee.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
Helmer Lee was probably the first to bring the theory of cultural courses to language learning.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
That's what we just talked about.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
In fact, Chinese language learning and Chinese culture learning should include these three elements.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
The textbook I made today emphasizes this third element, behavior culture.

11:12.000 --> 11:21.000
Next, we just have to talk about ICC, Intercultural Communication Competence.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Intercultural Communication Competence.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
We will probably start with Byron.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Byron's ICC model.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Let's take a quick look at it.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
This is an indicator that we wrote on the textbook.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
Byron thinks that in terms of cross-cultural recognition, knowledge and behavior,

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
the five indicators of cross-cultural communication competence are attitude, knowledge, cultural interpretation,

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
cultural discovery, interaction, and cultural self-awareness.

11:57.000 --> 12:09.000
The key point of Byron's cross-cultural communication competence is not only the ability of a cross-culturalist to express his goal-oriented culture,

12:09.000 --> 12:22.000
but also to make his own culture and goal-oriented culture a link, a comparison,

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
and become an observer with independent thinking ability.

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
In fact, he emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Next, we have Fatini's ICC model.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I think everyone is familiar with it.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
This is an indicator of cross-cultural communication competence.

12:40.000 --> 12:51.000
It includes several aspects, including human relations, communication, collaboration, and cooperation.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
In addition, there are four other components, such as attitudes.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
I will briefly talk about them.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
These are the key points of cross-cultural communication competence.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
Next, we will talk about the third-space theory, which has been valued more and more in recent years.

13:15.000 --> 13:26.000
The third-space theory originates from the theory of Homi Bhabha, an Egyptian scholar.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
It has been extended to our cross-cultural teaching.

13:31.000 --> 13:39.000
The concept of the third space is different from the concept of intermediate language.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Intermediate language is a transition process between one language and two languages.

13:44.000 --> 14:00.000
The third space in culture is to create a space of compromise between culture and goal.

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
It is a dynamic part, but it emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding and observation.

14:09.000 --> 14:19.000
Professor Wu Yongyi also mentioned that learners learn two languages not only to acquire a tool for communication,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
but also to improve their cognitive and thinking ability.

14:24.000 --> 14:37.000
Recently, Dr. Zhang Xin also brought the third-space theory to the approach of cross-cultural teaching.

14:38.000 --> 14:48.000
Finally, we will talk about the five C's of the American Foreign Language Teaching Association.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
The five C's are the most important indicators of successful foreign language learning.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I especially like this picture.

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
There are different importance and different aspects in the five C's.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
This picture puts the five C's of communication at the center.

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
Communication consists of three aspects.

15:20.000 --> 15:30.000
Communication is realized by the input and output of four kinds of learning.

15:30.000 --> 15:40.000
Finally, the four C's are closely integrated into the communication ability of language learning.

15:40.000 --> 15:47.000
Let's take a quick look at the relevant parts of cross-cultural teaching.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
The first is the interpersonal communication in communication.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
It refers to being able to freely communicate with people under the basis of understanding the context.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Sometimes people don't understand the context,

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
but because they don't understand the context, they can't interact with people in a positive way.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
The next is the understanding and interpretation.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Understanding and interpretation are usually placed in language teaching,

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
but I believe that many foreign language teachers are particularly impressed by this.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Many languages ​​are not equivalent to the meaning of the text.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
For example, you are so beautiful today.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Then you say that your eyes and nose are beautiful.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
In fact, they understand the meaning of the word,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
but they don't understand the meaning of the word in the context.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
The real meaning is humility.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Next, after understanding,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
learners should be able to confidently demonstrate it,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
say it, or write it.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
The next is the 3P in culture, which we are very familiar with.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
We can compare this with Hamelin,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and there are some similarities.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
But in fact, in the 5Cs of Apple,

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
it does not refer to the behavioral culture mentioned by Hamelin.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
But it may be shown in other 5Cs.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
The next is the connection,

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
which is to expand one's connection to the world and the target language through the learning of a foreign language.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
The next is the comparison.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Comparison is, of course, in our language learning,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
including language comparison, including cultural comparison.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The last is Communities,

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
which is to be able to create a bilingual community activity,

17:50.000 --> 17:57.000
or to be able to enter Communities when entering a target language country.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
What I want to emphasize is that many of our foreign students,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
for example, they are always in a language center,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
or they are friends with foreign students.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
In fact, it is to encourage them to enter the target language Communities.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Finally, I would like to quickly say that

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
in fact, this Hamelin,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
his cultural learning indicators,

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
for me, gave me a lot of inspiration in my writing and teaching.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
He said how to train yourself,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
including a comment event,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
a cultural fairy tale,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
and how to investigate in a role-play way,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
as well as the discussion of the values of the target language language culture,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
cultural understanding and learning,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
as well as the list of cultural elements.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
Next, I will briefly introduce the theory of the background of cross-culturalization to you.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Then we will enter the concept of the description of my entire textbook.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
First of all, based on all the cross-culturalization just mentioned,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
the ability to communicate,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
and the purpose of reaching a cross-culturalization,

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
we will find that the cross-culturalization comes from two things.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
The first is that you have to feel comfortable.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Language learning has to feel comfortable.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
The second is that people with goals and countries should feel comfortable and not be offended.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So, when I was doing a data collection,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I noticed this kind of data collection.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Let's take a look.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
In fact, the whole framework of communication includes so many elements.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
But in general,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
the purpose of language learning is to achieve proper communication.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
But in general,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
in fact, we will probably pay more attention to this part of the current textbook.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
But the part of the blue frame, the part of the non-language part,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and some cultural parts,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
the cultural parts of Behavioral,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
are actually less written for it.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
Next, let's take a look.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
So, when I was doing the demand analysis,

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
it was different from the general textbook in terms of data collection.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
The collection of my textbook

20:15.000 --> 20:23.000
will collect a lot of real context and scenes of cross-culturalization.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
So, I started to do a lot of interviews,

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
and I did an in-depth interview with foreign students who came to Taiwan,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and their contacts,

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
including their Chinese teachers and general teachers.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Why?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Because during my interview,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I visited foreign students first.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Foreign students think that Chinese teachers are their biggest source of language,

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
or the best resource for all kinds of cultural adaptation.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
It is also a clear object in their mind.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
We found that foreign students think that Chinese teachers and general teachers,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
many of our foreign students do not come to Taiwan to learn Chinese,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
they may be international students.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
So, the teachers they come into contact with are not the Chinese teachers who understand different student cultures very well,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
but the teachers of general science.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
The teachers of general science may not come into contact with a large number of foreign students,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
so they often have some communication barriers.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
So, in fact, there is a big difference between teachers and students.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Then there are their roommates,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Taiwanese roommates,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
and some foreign students,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
they are technical families.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
So, this is where my main scenario comes from.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
Next, I would like to quickly share with you my interview with this cross-border group,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
including these three.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I am one of the technical families.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
This is a resource that you rarely come into contact with,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
a source of barrier to cultural communication.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Let me share with you.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
This is a technical family's interview question.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
At the time of my interview, the epidemic broke out in Taiwan.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
So it's probably all online.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
At that time, it was usually a family of two or three groups.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Sometimes it was a family of one or two groups,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
depending on the time.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
In fact, when these families interviewed,

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
they contributed some very rich cases of getting along.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
And you will find that they often have a lot of common problems,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
some common problems.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
So this is the question I asked them.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Before the interview,

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
I had already read a lot of articles about the barriers to Chinese culture

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
by foreign students.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
So when I was leading,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I would actually put these,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
when discussing,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
when discussing something that is not rich enough,

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
I would also give them some hints

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
to see if they really,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
really encountered this kind of communication difficulty.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
That's also a kind of correction.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
So let's take a look.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
My question is probably from the technical family itself,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
his feelings.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
And then there's his observation.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
And then there's the reaction of foreign students to him.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
We interviewed a total of 10 families.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
A lot of people have even more than 10 years of experience.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
They have hosted dozens of foreign students.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
And then they became long-term good friends.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
It's very rare for them to share this kind of experience.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
It's very different from what the Chinese teacher said.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They are actually more living.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
In addition, I will also ask them the last question.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
When we asked the Chinese teacher this question,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
of course,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
what do you think can be put in the textbook?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Chinese teachers are professional,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
so their sharing is in place.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
But I later found that the technical family's sharing is very interesting.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
It's not quite the same as what our Chinese professor thinks.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
They think,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
how come I don't know this,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't know that.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Didn't your teacher teach you?

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
So I later put some of the things they shared

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
into the case I'm going to share today.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
Okay, so that's probably one of my ways of interviewing.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Next, in my interview,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
a preliminary analysis,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
we found some very special things.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
The first is that in fact,

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
foreign students have a great difference in the difficulty of cross-cultural communication,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
including different countries and different geographical locations.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
For example,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
European and American students complain that Taiwan is very hot.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Southeast Asian students complain that Taiwan is very cold.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
That also includes the issue of race.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
For example,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
the same issue is the issue of Chinese students in the United States,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
and the issue of non-Chinese white people,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and the issue of people with skin color.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
The cultural barriers they encounter are very, very different.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Of course, it also includes the issue of religion.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
For example,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
students with a Christian background

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
find it very difficult to find the real food,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
and find it very difficult.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
There is also the issue of gender.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
For example,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
male students who are white

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
are often worshipped as idols,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
or black male students

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
are often asked some very impolite questions

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
in the south-central region,

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
and even asked to touch their hair.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Then there is the age difference.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Foreign students of different ages

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
also have a great difference in their feelings.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
So after my interview,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I actually have two ideas.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
The first is that

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
our textbook should show the issue of universality,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and also the issue of racial discrimination.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So my textbook today

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
is mainly for students with a North American background.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Next,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
this is an analysis of the source of the entire article.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So behind it,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
there is our highest indicator,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
which is the ability to communicate.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Next,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I have already found some documents.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
You probably know

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
the difficulties of cultural adaptation.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Next is our interview.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It is actually mainly to collect a context,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
so that our textbooks are more consistent.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
This is a real context.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Next,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
this set of communication of miniaturized textbooks,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
the design of miniaturized textbooks,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
is a starting point for the students themselves.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
I originally planned to shoot this set of textbooks in Taiwan.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Then,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I would present it in a video format.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Unfortunately,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
before I came to the United States,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
the epidemic in Taiwan broke out.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
So this film was not able to be shot.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Later,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I changed this kind of textbook

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
to use a large number of pictures to present.

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
So I hope it is a video textbook.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Next,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
it is mainly for miniaturized communication.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It is not just a set of textbooks.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
So it is probably suitable for A2 or above.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
If you are a second-year student in the United States,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
you will have some simple Chinese grammar,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
and then you will have a certain vocabulary ability.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Even if he has some vocabulary ability,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
he will not be able to achieve it.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
He will also be familiar with the description of the vocabulary we provide.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
He can learn it by reading it.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Next,

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
it is suitable for soldiers who will stay in Taiwan.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
He will stay in Taiwan for a long time.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
He is not a tourist,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
or even a short-term primary school student.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Primary school students are very limited in contact with the local area.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
He may stay in Taiwan for more than half a year.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
In addition,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I hope it is a set suitable for self-study.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I think language textbooks

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
need a professional language teacher.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
A good textbook teaching method.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
But I think culture,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
based on a certain level of language,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
can actually continue.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Next,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
let's talk about this quickly.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
This is the assessment we may do later.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Actually,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I haven't done this part yet.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Let's skip it.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm afraid we don't have enough time.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Let's take a look now.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
The design of my entire course structure.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
What we will see later is not a video.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
It will be text and pictures.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Next,

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
we will provide some interactive questions.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
The main thing is to promote the cultivation of his cultural ability,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
including some cultural comparisons and cultural insights.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
We will ask him in different ways.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
We will also tell him

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
why it is like this.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
What is the culture behind him?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
This part is an analysis of a cultural point.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I wrote this part in English.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
This part is about understanding,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
not learning the language itself.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
So we need to let the students know it,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
and know why.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Most students will say,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
teacher, are you full?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
We all say that

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
it's good to be taught by a language teacher.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
But why do I say, teacher, are you full?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Why do you have to say hello and eat?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
If he knows,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
he will feel more warm.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
At the end,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
there will be some discussion and suggestions.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
If you really feel uncomfortable,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
how do I express it to him?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Next,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
let's take a look.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
I collected these cultural points.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Actually, I received a lot of these points.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
But I basically only made four lessons.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Two lessons are related to the class.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
One is the interaction with the teacher.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The other is the cultural conflict in the classroom.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
The second is the general life,

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
including visiting friends and staying in the dormitory.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
But this dormitory is not a general dormitory.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
For example,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Americans and Americans live in the same dormitory.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Frankly speaking, there is no problem.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
It's amazing that the bathroom looks different,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
the bed is harder,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
these things.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
In fact, there is no communication problem.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
But if he lives outside,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
especially with Taiwanese roommates,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
this conflict is very big.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
What we are going to share later is

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
the class of visiting friends.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm sorry,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
my screen is very blurry.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
In fact,

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
his speech should appear after the point.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
The picture will be better.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
In order to overcome this,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I can't make it into a video.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
So I tried my best to find some pictures that look very blurry.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
This is the person in the picture.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
We are going to visit this person and his grandmother.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
Let's take a look at the development of our course.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Jian Ting is Wenjie's good friend in Taiwan.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
This weekend,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Jian Ting invites Wenjie to visit his grandmother.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Please note that

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
in our language course,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
we will call grandma,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
grandma.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
We won't call grandma.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
In fact,

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
our course is designed to target Taiwan as a country.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
So I believe everyone can understand.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
In Taiwan,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
the opportunity to call grandma is much more than to call grandma.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
So I deliberately put grandma.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Why?

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Because this is also what I received.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
A student in the south.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
He learned Chinese very well.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
But he found that there are many people who don't speak Mandarin in the south.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So when he learned Chinese,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
he went to the southeast.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
He couldn't order food in the night market.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
He didn't understand Mandarin.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So it caused a cultural problem.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So I put him in front of grandma.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Then make a simple explanation.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Then let's take a look.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
He said,

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Hello, nice to meet you.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
I am Li Wenjie.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
What is your name?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
We see that the language teacher is very good.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
He wants to use honorifics.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
But he asked grandma,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
what is your name?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Grandma was very suspicious.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Why would anyone ask my name?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I am Lin Meizhu.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Then he said,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
you can call me grandma like Jian Ting.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Then Wenjie said,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
okay, grandma, hello.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Let's take a look.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
This cultural point,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
everyone should feel it.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
He said,

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
please put on slippers.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
He said,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
oh, I forgot.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
I have to take off my shoes.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
My socks are broken.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
I'm so sorry.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Then Jian Ting said,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
it doesn't matter.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Grandma, this is a gift for you.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Open it and take a look.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I hope you like it.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
As a result,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
grandma said,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
thank you, you're welcome.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Put the gift next to it.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Please drink hot tea.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Wenjie can't stand it, right?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
It's so hot.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Can you give me a cup of iced tea?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Jian Ting said, okay.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Then next,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
grandma asked Jian Ting,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
you tell Jian Ting,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
you help me ask Wenjie.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Does he have a girlfriend?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Grandma wants to introduce him.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
What did Wenjie say?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Grandma, I understand Chinese.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
You can talk to me directly.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Thank you,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
but I like to find a girlfriend myself.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't know what you think of this class.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I think if there are a lot of Chinese teachers on site,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
you should have seen

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
how many cultural points there are.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Let's take a look.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
This is what's next.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
After we provide the text and vocabulary,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
we're going to take the second step.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
We're going to have an interactive stimulus.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So let's look at this first.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Hello, nice to meet you.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm Li Wenjie.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
What's your name?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
This is actually...

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
It's hard for us to tell students.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
We're interacting in Chinese class, right?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
What's my name?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
What's your name?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But in real life,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
when we visit our grandparents in the countryside,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
we don't seem to be able to ask them

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
what their names are.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Right?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So here,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
we have the first question.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Do you think Wenjie is a good greeting?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
This is the first point.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
Let him have a cultural awareness.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
So we let him choose.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
He thinks it's good.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
That's what all teachers do, right?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Next,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
it might be a little weird.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
He can't ask his grandparents' names directly.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Next,

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
of course,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
we'll tell him that

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
it's not convenient for us to ask his name directly.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
We usually stop here.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Don't ask your grandparents' names.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
But students will find it strange.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Why can I ask,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
but he can't?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
we need to look further.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We need to know what we want to know.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
That's how we can reach a deeper understanding.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So we use the English term

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
for the greeting culture.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Actually,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
in Chinese,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the greeting culture of the Chinese

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
is an ancient culture.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
It's impolite to ask his name directly.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Especially the elders.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
So you can ask your grandparents' names directly.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
But the elders can't.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
They can't.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
So they might say,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
or whatever.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
That's how it usually goes.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
We can only ask his name.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Next,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
let's look at the second one.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
He said,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
you can call me grandma like Jianting.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
This grandma is kind.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Wenjie said,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
okay,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
grandma,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
hello.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
We see that their elders call them grandma.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's a very intimate thing.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
But for an American student,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
I'm afraid he'll feel very uncomfortable.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So we ask him,

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
if someone asks you to call someone you just met,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
this granny,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
in the American language,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
granny is really just your grandma.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
It could also be a good friend.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But you have to be familiar.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
You can't meet an old lady on the road and call her granny.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
So we ask him how he feels.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Take care of his feelings.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
I think it's good.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Very intimate.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Or I think it's strange.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
But we have to bring out this cultural point.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Why?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Taiwanese people don't call names.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
In the United States,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
from old to young,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
you can call names.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
No matter how important it is,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
you can call their names.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
But we often use family names.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Here's another explanation.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
How do you call people?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
How do you call people?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
And then here,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
you can do a simple cultural practice.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
A simple cultural practice.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
In fact, this is because there is no video.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
If it's a video,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
you should say,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
this person,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
what do you call him?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
What do you call him?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Something like that.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Okay.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Let's move on.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
This is just a point of communication.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
In fact,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
in this painting,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
in order to achieve a real woman,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I didn't make these cultural points a distinction.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
What is behavioral culture?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
What is information culture?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
That is,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
based on the scene.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Based on the scene of a visit.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So what he brought here

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is an information culture.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
In Taiwan,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
it's almost like changing shoes.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Of course,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
we also need to achieve a sense of humor

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
and a sense of

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
a sense of humor

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
and a sense of realism.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Right?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
In the United States,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
you really don't have to compromise.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm afraid this kind of embarrassment will happen.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
So,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
to increase their understanding.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Okay.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
So,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
let's start with his own problem.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
His own culture.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Do you compromise when you go home?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Do you compromise when you visit a friend's house?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Next,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
if you are asked to go out,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
how do you feel?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
And then,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
can you not compromise?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Especially if

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
your socks just have a hole.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Can you?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
How to communicate properly.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Next,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
let's tell him why

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
compromise in Taiwan.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
In fact,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
it's not just Taiwan.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Most countries compromise.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
And then,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
let him judge.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
This,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
this feeling,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
the point where you feel uncomfortable,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
can it be reflected?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
But in fact,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
the result is probably

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
that you can't help but compromise.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Okay,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
so this is an English explanation.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Okay,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
next.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Okay,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
this is the culture of giving gifts.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Okay,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
our culture is the culture of giving gifts.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Okay,

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Americans say,

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
oh,

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
I prepared it for you.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Please open it and take a look.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Okay,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
but grandma is an old-fashioned person,

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
right?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
He's embarrassed to open it in public.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Okay,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
so he said,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
thank you,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
you're welcome.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I didn't open it.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
next,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
let's see.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
This is also a foreign student

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
who reflects

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
the culture of giving gifts in Taiwan.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Taiwanese also reflect

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
the culture of giving gifts to foreign students.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
What's behind it?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
This,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
foreign students think

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Taiwanese are generous.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
There are a lot of gifts

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
for him,

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
very valuable.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Taiwanese think

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
foreign students

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
are very stingy.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I gave him such an expensive gift.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
How can he give me

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
such a worthless gift?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay,

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
as you can see,

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
this is not a matter of generosity,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
but a matter of cultural difference.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
So,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
let's take a quick look here.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Okay,

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
uh,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
he may have a way.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Okay,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
ask him,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
why do you think

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
the goal of this country's grandma is

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
that she doesn't open it,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
she just puts it next to it?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Okay,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
and then,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
it creates a cultural contrast.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Here we talk about

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
the Chinese culture

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
as a sign of sincerity

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
to give gifts.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
But,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
in the United States,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
he may really be

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
a kind person.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Uh,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
what did you do?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Uh,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
even,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
uh,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
give a bouquet,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
which is a very good gift.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
His main expression

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
is the part of that friendship.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
So,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
it will cause a political difference

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
between the two sides

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
in giving gifts.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
It caused a misunderstanding,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
uh,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
caused a kind of,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
uh,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
a misunderstanding in this understanding.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Okay,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
next,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
we will talk about

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
some details

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
in the Chinese culture

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
of giving gifts.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Then,

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
this cultural point

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
will lead to

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
the culture of giving gifts.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Okay,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I want to

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
finish it as soon as possible.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Uh,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
next,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
like,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
for example,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
drinking iced tea,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
this kind of thing,

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
do you really have to be patient

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
to completely ignore

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
your own culture?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
In fact,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
not necessarily.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
For example,

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
drinking water,

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
you really don't want to drink hot water.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Uh,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
you can actually say,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
you don't want to drink cold water.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Okay,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
okay,

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
next,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
this is a,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
I am,

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
I am,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
uh,

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
I have collected all of these,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
uh,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
uh,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
these,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
uh,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
it should be said that

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I did not collect this

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
in the academic paper,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
but when I did this,

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I was later in,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
uh,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
a U.S. election,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
when I handed this out,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
there was a student

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
who was almost

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
saying that

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
really,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
when I was in Taiwan,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
I encountered

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
a point that

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
was very special.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
This is really,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
this is,

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
he,

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
especially the two

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
foreign students

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
who shared it,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
they shared it very vividly,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
they were very unhappy

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
and very angry that

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
he was obviously

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
good at English,

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
he was good at Chinese,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
he just didn't talk to me,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
he just wanted to talk to me

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
through that person.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Okay,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
let's take a look at

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
these,

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
these will all

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
have some explanations

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
why

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Chinese is indirectly

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
transmitted.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Is it rude?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Or is it

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
bullying you?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Maybe not,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
maybe sometimes

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
it's about

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
respect for that person,

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
respect for the person who introduced him,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
maybe sometimes

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
he's just

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
shy.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Okay,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
then I think

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
we'll start

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
with the

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
textbook sharing

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
here.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Okay,

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
then later,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
I put these

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
four courses

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
in the

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
University of

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
the United States

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
as a

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
working method

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
for

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
this

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Chinese learner,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
and then

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
to a

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
certain

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
level of Chinese,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
and then

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
this

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
feedback is

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
very good,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
very good.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Some of them

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
have been to Taiwan,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
and even

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
those who have been to

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Taiwan,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I personally

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
interviewed them

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
again,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
they felt

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
that

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
they felt

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
in place,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
so

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
I was

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
very confident

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
in

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
writing

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
this

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
textbook,

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
so

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
I can

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
probably

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
continue to

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
write

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
this

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
textbook.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Okay,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
then I

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
will

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
move on

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
to the

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
next

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
discussion

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
topic,

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
which

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
is,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
uh,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
does

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
cross-cultural

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
teaching

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
require

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
nationalization

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
design?

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Because

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
C1 to

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
C2

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
are

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
not

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
equal,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
right?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Okay,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
next,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
cross-cultural

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
teaching

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
design.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Thank you,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Dai Ping.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
It's really

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
very interesting.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
I don't

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
know

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
if

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
anyone

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
at the

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
scene

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
has any

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
questions

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
for the

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
audience?

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Yes,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
or

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
do you have

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
any suggestions?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
I believe

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
if there are

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Chinese

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
teachers

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
or

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
learners

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
at the

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
scene,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
they

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
can

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
share

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
their

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
thoughts

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
and

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
experiences

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
with

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
the

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
audience.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
think

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
it's

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
very

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
important

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
to

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
share

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
your

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
thoughts

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
and

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
experiences

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
with

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
the

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
audience.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
I

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
think

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
it's

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
very

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
important

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
to

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
share

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
your

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
thoughts

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
and

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
experiences

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
with

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
the

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
audience.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
I

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
think

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
it's

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
very

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
important

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
to

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
share

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
your

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
thoughts

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
and

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
experiences

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
with

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
the

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
audience.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Thank

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
you.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Thank

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
you.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Thank

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
you.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Thank

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
you.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Thank

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
you.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Thank

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
you.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
My

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
next

44:58.000 --> 45:19.000
question

45:19.000 --> 45:38.000
is

45:38.000 --> 46:03.000
about

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Internet

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
connections.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
Yes, but I think this paper mainly focuses on the feelings of the local people, the goal and the country.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
We usually collect the feelings of our second language learners.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Yes, but in fact, this will produce a big blind spot.

47:51.000 --> 47:58.000
That is, he does not know that his own language behavior is causing the other party's discomfort.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Oh, okay.

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
Yes, so what I received this time was, for example, the technical family and their roommates.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
In addition to the foreign students, in fact, their feedback is very, very rich.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
At this moment, I did not see the complaints part.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
In fact, I have a lot of complaints.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
For example, he blamed his American roommates for not turning off the lights and air conditioning.

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
But in fact, I know that this is because of the overall difference in life.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
In the United States, everyone really does not turn off the lights and air conditioning.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
He is not particularly wasteful.

48:38.000 --> 48:44.000
Yes, so there are some differences in the environment behind him that cause such a difference.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
But it will cause a barrier to cultural communication.

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
For example, American students will be labeled as wasteful or something.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Because in the United States, there is really no need to turn off the lights and air conditioning.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
For example, they must turn on the air conditioning in winter.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Otherwise, it will freeze, right?

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Yes, yes.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
And in the end, just adjust the temperature.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
It's not particularly a waste of electricity.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yes, it's like this.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
So it's because the environment in Taiwan itself is different, so it's incomprehensible.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
Yes, but if you let American students know,

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
he can at least have a chance to explain that if he forgets, it's because of me.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
In this case, it's not easy to create a barrier to communication.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
Or it's a kind of stereotype.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Okay, thank you.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Thank you.

49:40.000 --> 49:48.000
I think your research has discussed many aspects of cultural communication.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
I was thinking about this.

49:51.000 --> 49:58.000
Because there are many aspects of culture that are difficult to explain directly.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
For example, we have L1 and L2 transfer.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
You can say which is positive transfer and which is negative transfer.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
You can compare and see which is which.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Because culture is also a different distance, a different understanding.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I don't know if there is...

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
Because I feel like I'm learning another culture.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
And I feel like there are a lot of...

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
From the most basic, face-to-face, to visit someone.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.000
You have a lot of interactions that don't seem to go well.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
Yes, and then I think, wow, how can I finish learning like this?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
And then I think, is there...

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
I don't know if this is practical or useful.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
For example, C1, Cultural 1 transfer.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
Is there a place where they can say, this is actually...

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Increase awareness.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I think your question will increase a lot of intercultural awareness.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
But I don't know if it will help them.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh, this is...

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I don't know.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Which ones are similar and which ones are really different?

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Yes, you see, language ability is very good at measuring, right?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
And the test knows where you are.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
OPI does it and you know where the language ability is.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
But cultural ability is really hard to measure.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And language ability is not equal to cultural ability.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
We see some people.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
His Chinese is not very good, but he is very good at communicating.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
But his communication is very solid, right?

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
That may be a kind of self-awareness.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Or his own attitude.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
He himself has a respect for the goal language culture.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Like and his open heart.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
So in fact, I think this part of cultural learning.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
His variability is greater.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Really big.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And there are a lot of points to learn.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
So that's why I think.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I also want to ask everyone to share.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Do you think cultural learning is suitable for self-learning?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Plus the combination of the media now.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
He is very diverse.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
He is very diverse.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Then it's okay.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Then the length is not the same.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
We are online teaching materials.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
We don't need to be limited by time.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
So I am completely based on the situation.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Where should this situation go?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Where is it?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
What are the points of this situation?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Let it happen naturally.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Then there is the description of the whole situation.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I am very grateful to my audience.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
My situation is actually from their narrative.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Of course, you have to sort it out more smoothly.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
More interesting.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Something like that.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
So I am talking about myself.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I am talking about the direction of writing a new textbook.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Is this really helpful?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
The purpose of communication.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I can understand you.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Do you think this textbook direction is reasonable?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I think you wrote that.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Because you want to use the way of the film.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Because I think this intercultural experience.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Communication failure.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Such an experience.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I think it is an experiential learning.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
But because of this.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I think it is a good experience.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I think it is a good experience.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Experiential learning.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Because if you are not experienced.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
It is difficult to understand.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
This is very common.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
This is very common.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Or specific cases.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Sometimes you feel.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
This is really like this.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
If it is really a different culture.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
So I think if you use a film.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
You can see some.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
You can't say it with blood or photos.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Because you have written.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Facial expression.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
You can't feel these.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You can't feel these.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
For example, pauses.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Feedback to pauses.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Feedback to pauses.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
That is very important.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
That is invisible.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
That is really.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Verbal.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
That is the most difficult.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It must rely on the film.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I received a lot of.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Internet celebrities in Taiwan.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Their films are very interesting.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But they must be their own feelings.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Take it as a film.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
It is more like a gradual progress.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Or some behind the scenes.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Excitement.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It means that everyone is watching very lively.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Of course, I also learned some things.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
But you see it.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
It is very suitable for self-study.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I think it is very suitable for self-study.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I think it is very suitable for self-study.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Because they have to have that.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
If there is no environment.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
No real contact with the locals.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
No way to understand.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
This is a communication.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
This is a communication failure.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
This is a communication failure.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I think you have collected information.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I think you have collected information.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
For example, his technical family.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Some of his contacts.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Some information.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I think it is very important.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Because I think in terms of language learning.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
In addition to learning to communicate with the locals.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
In addition to learning to communicate with the locals.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Locals.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
They also have a culture difference.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
They also have a culture difference.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
They also have a cultural competence.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
They also have a culture competence.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
They have to know.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
How to interact with those

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
How to interact with those

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Thai language learners in the cultural field.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Thai language learners in the cultural field.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I do n't know what to do

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
How to accept

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
How to accept

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
How to train

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
How to train

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And get to know

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
What is appropriate

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
What is appropriate

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
How to train

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
What is appropriate

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
How to train

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
How to train

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
How to train

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Thai

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Thai

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Thai

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Thai

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Thai

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Thai

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I think that's very difficult

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I received that

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I still can't think of a good

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
expression

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
It's hard to explain

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Because silence has all kinds of situations

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Thank you

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
This is very difficult

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I think you see, my world is still a

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Relatively easy

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Some cultural backgrounds that are easier to understand

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Right

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Ok

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Time is almost up

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Is there anyone else

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Is there anyone else

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Who has anything to say

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
This is my email

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
This is my email

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
So if you have any

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Experience or comments

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
If you want to talk to me

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Write to me

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Thank you

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Thank you

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
If there are no questions

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I want to thank you for this wonderful speech

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
I think your textbook is very interesting

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I think it's very useful

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
For

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
For

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
For international students

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Who come to Taiwan

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
So I'm looking forward to their use

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
You said this summer

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
They will start using this textbook

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Or if you have students who want to come to Taiwan

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
You can recommend it to me

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I can also share this textbook with him

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
And then by the way, ask him to give me some feedback

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Please contact

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Free learning opportunities

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Ok

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
If anyone wants to provide funding

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
To help us make a video

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Probably not

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I think

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
If you hear any information

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I will definitely share it with you

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
I think this is a very meaningful textbook

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Thank you for spending so much time

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
It's very interesting

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Actually, I thought I could shoot when I came to the United States

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I want to say

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
You can always make it look like

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
But I gave up

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Because it's really hard to be exactly the same

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Then just don't

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Just don't

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Just have to shoot in place

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Yes

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
So I'm looking forward to the next development

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
If there is

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
If there is

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
For example, when you finish writing

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Because you are still

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't plan to finish writing

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Because it's just a few lessons

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Yes, just a few lessons

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Then slowly expand

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
That's it

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Thank you

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Your follow-up

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Please keep in touch

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Ok

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Thank you

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Thank you all

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Goodbye
