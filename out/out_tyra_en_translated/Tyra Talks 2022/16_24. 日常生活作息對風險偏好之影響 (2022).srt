00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Taira is a friendly environment for young Taiwanese researchers,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and we hold Taira Talk every weekend throughout the year.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The format and content of this speech are very free and diverse,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and academic researchers can come here to share their achievements

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
based on their own qualifications, practice online lectures,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or get to know future potential researchers.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Please join the audience on the right.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today's speaker is Yan Zhiyun.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
She is currently a PhD student at Paul Glincher University of New York,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Professor of Neuroscience and Economics.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Her main research focus is on collecting long-term data

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
from mobile apps to explore the relationship between

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
individual daily activities and their risks and time preferences.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Today's speech is a part of the data sharing.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The results of today's sharing have already been reviewed in the first round,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and are currently being reviewed,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so she welcomes any suggestions and ideas.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If there are any questions during the speech,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
she can interrupt, right?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, you can interrupt or ask questions if you don't understand.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yan Zhiyun, I'll leave the next part to you.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me share the screen.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, good.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Do you understand?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know why I suddenly have echo.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you still have it now?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, I don't think so.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The topic of my speech today is

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
First of all, thank you everyone for coming to this event.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The topic of my speech today is

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
what my PhD thesis is doing.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We all know that risk and uncertainty

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
are closely related to many of our choices in our lives.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For example, whether to get vaccinated.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In Taiwan, we don't think it's risky to get vaccinated.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But in the US,

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
many people don't want to get vaccinated because they think it's dangerous.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Or in another domain,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for example, do you want to invest in virtual currency?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So a person's preference for taking risks

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So a person's preference for taking risks

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
actually greatly affects whether he is willing to make these decisions.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So when we researchers study,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we put this concept

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a person's individual willingness

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to make this kind of risky choice

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
called risk preference or risk additivity.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
a person's individual willingness to make this kind of risky choice

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
called risk preference or risk additivity.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Whether it's economics or psychology,

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
we usually think of risk preference

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
as a more stable psychological trait.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
as a more stable psychological trait.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There will be differences between individuals.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But more and more research shows that

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
our risk preferences are actually between individuals.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There will be systematic changes.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There will be systematic changes.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's very dynamic.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we want to know

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
what kind of factors will cause

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
whether it's between individuals or within individuals

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So in the past,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
our gender is a factor.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Our gender is a factor.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In the past,

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
women are usually more at risk

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in terms of financial risk.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Women are usually more at risk in terms of financial risk.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Or older people are more at risk

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
in terms of financial risk.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Research also shows that

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
if you have a good cognitive ability,

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you are more willing to take some risks.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you are more willing to take some risks.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you are a person with anxiety,

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you are a person with anxiety,

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There are many factors that cause it.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For example,

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
human or animal research shows

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that your metabolic state

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that your metabolic state

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
may affect your risk preference,

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
may affect your risk preference,

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but in a relatively short time scale.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, the good or bad weather

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
may also affect your level of risk acceptance.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There is a more interesting study

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that says that if the weather is pretty good today,

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that says that if the weather is pretty good today,

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
this is a study done in New York City,

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the probability of buying a lottery ticket is also higher.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is an incidental good news.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is an incidental good news.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not as if you think the weather is good today,

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
so you feel good.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So you are willing to do something

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that you think will make you feel better about these risks.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you are willing to do something that you think will make you feel better about these risks.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
For example, buying lottery tickets.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of course, there are other studies that point out

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
of course, there are other studies that point out

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
people became more risk averse to investment.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
people became more risk averse to investment.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is a major life event

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
that affects your level of risk acceptance.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So there are many different factors

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that affect your level of risk acceptance.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that affect your level of risk acceptance.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So we can find that the topic of risk aversion

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So we can find that the topic of risk aversion

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it's been studied for decades.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And in all these years of research,

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you find that there are so many different factors

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
that affect the so-called risk aversion.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that affect the so-called risk aversion.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's actually very difficult to know

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So what my PhD thesis mainly wants to study

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
is how to put all the factors together

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is how to put all the factors together

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So we have two main goals.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So we have two main goals.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The first is to establish a data-driven

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
domain general risk preference ontology.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
domain general risk preference ontology.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So this concept is to give a more comprehensive definition

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
of risk attitude or risk preference.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
of risk attitude or risk preference.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So compared to the past,

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the most recent research is usually a single

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
risk measure or a single survey or a single

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
task developed by economists.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
task developed by economists.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So in our experiment,

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we not only use a single risk attitude measure,

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
we not only use a single risk attitude measure,

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
we use a survey and task-based measure.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we use a survey and task-based measure.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We also include a lot of different psychological traits,

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We also include a lot of different psychological traits,

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
such as your cognitive ability,

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
such as your cognitive ability,

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
demographic data,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
mental well-being and personality.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
mental well-being and personality.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We put all these things together

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We put all these things together

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and we did a PCA,

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and we did a PCA,

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
which is the Principle Component Analysis,

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
which is the Principle Component Analysis,

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to determine what the covariance is between these

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
to determine what the covariance is between these

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
traits related to risk preference in the past.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
traits related to risk preference in the past.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then we want to know

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and these things usually only measured once,

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but we will do a repeated measurement,

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but we will do a repeated measurement,

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and we will do a longitudinal experiment.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And we will have a chance to get

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
more static and dynamic risk preference.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
more static and dynamic risk preference.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When we have the ability to make a more comprehensive

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
definition of risk preference,

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
we want to know if the environmental state

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and the state of life of the victim

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will affect the change of risk preference.

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
will affect the change of risk preference.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000

So, in the end,

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
we hope to establish

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
whether there are any risk preferences

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
in his life.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and whether there's a significant correlation

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
with the risk preferences we measured.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000

We also use these parameters

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to feed the risk-choice models

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to our data.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We use these parameters

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to create our model

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to create our model

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We use these parameters

375
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to create our model

376
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We use these parameters

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to create our model

378
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
to create our model

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This allows us to know

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
what the parameterb

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
or what the parameter's expectation is

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can think of these alpha parameters

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
as based on the alpha parameters

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
in EXPECT UDILY model

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Since we have such a model

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
we fit it into a single logistic function

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
with maximum likelyness

388
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The gamma parameters are used to measure

389
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the choice of noise in the task

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So we include these parameters

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in the variables I just mentioned

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
alpha, m, and gamma parameters

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So this is what we have

394
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let me talk about it a little bit

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There are also these model fitting parts

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's talk about our test subjects

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We have a total of 123 test subjects

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They are found in the CrackList

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and in NYU's Psychology Research Participant System

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But most of them are from CrackList

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So most of them are not students

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Out of the 123 test subjects

403
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
there are a lot of people who have completed the whole experiment

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This is a two-month experiment

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
but there are still a lot of people who have completed it

406
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So we have a pretty high compliance rate

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and there are 115 subjects who have completed all the experiments

408
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We exclude some subjects

409
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
because from their choice

410
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
we know that they don't seem to be doing the experiment seriously

411
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Or they did some very irrational behavior in our task

412
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is also one of the criteria for excluding test subjects

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
In the end, we include a total of 96 test subjects

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
in our final analysis

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So next I'm going to introduce

416
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the result of our PCA

417
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The result of this PCA

418
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is that we used the four principal components

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
to represent all of our data

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The four components in the front

421
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
contain a total of 46% of all variances

422
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's talk about the risk-choice ratio

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In fact, we are repeatedly measuring

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So we have a lot of risk-choice ratios

425
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So before we created this PCA

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
we used the mean value to represent

427
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the tasks that have been measured many times

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Then it is represented by their average value

429
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So in this table

430
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I have colored it

431
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The loading in this PCA is greater than 0.2

432
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So it means that in this principal component

433
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
these variables are more important

434
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We can find that

435
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
mainly in the first principal component

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It mainly contains these tables

437
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
related to mood and mental wellness

438
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and impulsivity

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
which is the UPPS document

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and intolerance of uncertainty

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
In fact, the intolerance of uncertainty

442
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
is measured by the psychiatrists' table

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
to measure the degree of uncertainty

444
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
of a person

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They often use this table

446
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to relate to anxiety and depression

447
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So we can find that

448
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the table designed by the psychiatrists

449
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
is more related to the anxiety

450
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and depression

451
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The table designed by the psychiatrists

452
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is more related to the anxiety

453
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and depression

454
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
We can find that

455
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
the table designed by people in different fields

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
is more related to the anxiety and depression

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We can find that

458
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The second principle component

459
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is the tasks designed by economists

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
is the tasks designed by economists

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It mainly contains

462
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the variables in the second principle component

463
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It mainly contains the variables in the second principle component

464
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We can find that

465
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
in this survey

466
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
we can find that

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
there are common variables in the second principle component

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
we can find that

469
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
there are common variables in the second principle component

470
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
We can talk about it

471
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
In fact, there is a big debate in the research of risk bias

472
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Is it a survey

473
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
or a game designed by economists

474
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The measured risk bias is your real risk bias

475
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
A part of the research is actually discussing

476
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
which measurement is more reliable

477
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
which measurement is more reliable

478
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
which measurement is more general

479
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
to measure the so-called risk performance

480
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
There is a debate

481
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
However, we found that the survey and the task

482
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
However, we found that the survey and the task

483
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
are highly related

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It is worth noting that

485
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
the task is related to financial risk

486
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the task is related to financial risk

487
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money

488
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money

489
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The other related is the risk to health

490
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The other related is the risk to health

491
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and the risk to safety

492
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Recreation is less related

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Recreation is the relation of others

494
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Recreation is the relation of others

495
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It is not so closely related

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The third and fourth are the remaining variants

497
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The third and fourth are the remaining variants

498
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The third is the ver Komponent

499
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task

500
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The fourth is the current variance

501
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task

502
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

504
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This principle Komponent is used as a single vector

506
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This principle Komponent is used as a single vector

507
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
to build dynamic risk preference ontology.

508
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?

510
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The way is

511
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
These models are model-free variables and model-based variables.

512
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
These variables have a relatively large loading in PCA3.

513
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So we use these loading.

514
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I just said that when we create this PCA,

515
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
we actually use the mean value.

516
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So what we're going to do is

517
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,000
we're going to take the different 8-week data

518
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and represent the different 8-week risk additive-related variables.

519
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We do metric multiplication.

520
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Let each indicator have a different risk additive score every week.

521
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
After the multiplication, each indicator will have 8.

522
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We have a total of 96 indicators.

523
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So there are 96 indicators and 8 data points for each indicator.

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So it will become a matrix of 8 times 96.

525
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Then we get the weekly risk component score.

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
One thing to remember is that

527
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
a relatively low risk component score indicates a higher risk tolerance.

528
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
A relatively low risk score means that you are more willing to take risks.

529
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This is actually just the relationship of positive and negative numbers in math.

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So you just need to remember this kind of relationship.

531
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What we're going to do is,

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
like I just said, how do we put our goal 1 and goal 2 together?

533
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We want to see how the risk component score of these 8 data points

534
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:17,000
is related to the different 8-week sleeping time duration and working time duration.

535
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So we want to know, for example,

536
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:30,000
whether the total length of sleep at T-1 will affect the current T-1 risk component score.

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
At the same time, we also want to know,

538
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:42,000
for example, the relationship between the previous week's risk component score and this week's risk component score.

539
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So we did a regression based on this relationship.

540
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So if we write this regression out, it's a bit like this.

541
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can think of this P3 as the risk component score for this week.

542
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What we want to know is,

543
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
how much of the previous week's sleep time duration can predict the risk component score for this week.

544
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We also added this variable,

545
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
which is the risk component score for the previous week,

546
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to control the autocorrelation.

547
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Then we added the dummy variables for each victim.

548
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Then we also asked,

549
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
after completing this regression,

550
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
how much of the residual can be explained by the previous two weeks' sleep time and the previous two weeks' risk component score.

551
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Then we also added the variable for the sleep time,

552
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,

553
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
to control the autocorrelation.

554
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We also added the variable for the work time,

555
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,

556
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
to control the autocorrelation.

557
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So we did a total of different regressions.

558
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Finally, this graph shows the beta value coefficient for this activity.

559
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This is the level of sleep.

560
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
At each time point, t-1, t-2, t-3, and t-4,

561
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:50,000
we found that sleeping at t-1 significantly predicts the risk.

562
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So this is the only significant result we found.

563
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
These two graphs show the risk of the previous week,

564
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and whether it has a significant impact on the risk of the next week.

565
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We found that it does.

566
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We also found that the predict power of other activities

567
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.

568
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We also found that the predict power of other activities

569
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.

570
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So this is the result we found.

571
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
To conclude,

572
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the domain-general-risk-attitude ontology can be used

573
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
to capture the relationships between your daily life

574
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and the dynamic of psychological properties.

575
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The sleep time can predict risk-evaluation changes.

576
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The conclusion from the results is,

577
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
if you had more sleep the previous week,

578
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
you will be more willing to take risks the next week.

579
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So, this conclusion can tell us that

580
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,000
a simple physiological thing can affect our risk-preferred changes.

581
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So, this is the conclusion we have so far.

582
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
We have also found that

583
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
your sleep level can also significantly affect

584
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
the negative mood of the next week.

585
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So, if you had more sleep the previous week,

586
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
you will be more willing to take risks the next week.

587
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So, the sleep time can predict a lot of things.

588
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So, this is what we have found so far.

589
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So, this is the end of my presentation.

590
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Thank you for listening to my presentation.

591
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Thank you, Ziyun, for your wonderful presentation.

592
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Thank you.

593
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Can I ask a question first?

594
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Sure, go ahead.

595
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So, I want to ask,

596
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
why is it that the more sleep you have, the more risk-tolerant you become?

597
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What I want to ask is,

598
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is risk-tolerance related to self-control?

599
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Does it need self-control or not?

600
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
For example, the less sleep a person has,

601
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
the less self-control they have.

602
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I don't know if this is correct.

603
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
If it's correct, then it's still incorrect.

604
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
If it's correct, then...

605
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Sorry, I'm just...

606
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Please continue.

607
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No, I mean...

608
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It sounds like the less self-control you have, the more...

609
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You can't take risks.

610
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You want to take more risks.

611
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, because...

612
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I think it's related.

613
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, I've seen that too.

614
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's because of the lack of self-control,

615
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so they take risks.

616
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That's right.

617
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
For example, drinking too much or something like that.

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I want to know more about this.

619
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I think it's mainly because...

620
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
First of all, we have measured the so-called self-control trait.

621
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We found that the trait has nothing to do with our risk attitude.

622
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's the first thing.

623
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think this relationship...

624
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The relationship we're trying to explain is...

625
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's because you might...

626
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Actually, I think the logic can be explained on both sides.

627
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
If we're talking about the logic of this story,

628
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
it's because you slept better last week,

629
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
so you might be in a better mood this week.

630
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
When you're in a better mood,

631
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
you might have a higher expectation for something risky.

632
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You might be more optimistic.

633
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So you might want to say,

634
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm more willing to take this risk.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's true.

636
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You just said that...

637
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I've seen this study too.

638
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
If a teenager doesn't sleep well,

639
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
if he's sleep-deprived,

640
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
he might not be able to calculate some of his behaviors.

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You can't do an effective calculation.

642
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He might not be able to do it.

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
He might do something risky.

644
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I've seen the direction of the study.

645
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So when I came to this conclusion,

646
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I was actually thinking about how to explain it.

647
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The explanation we wrote in the paper

648
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is probably to explain it in this way.

649
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The so-called repeated major risk

650
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
is actually more like financial risk.

651
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Strictly speaking,

652
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it's either no or zero.

653
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's in a positive domain.

654
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's not in the negative risk domain.

655
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So the teenager's risk is more likely to be lost.

656
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But our risk is more like the risk in the gain domain.

657
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So there might be such a difference.

658
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So, for example,

659
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the research here can't infer that

660
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the more you sleep,

661
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
the more you want to go to the casino.

662
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I think maybe...

663
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm just curious.

664
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
If you put it that way,

665
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't think there's a way.

666
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I think you put it very well.

667
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We're not particularly...

668
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If you sleep well,

669
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
if you face some risky things,

670
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you might be more serious about it.

671
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You're more serious about evaluating

672
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
or calculating what the risk is.

673
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Because some things are actually...

674
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Of course, after the assessment,

675
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
you're willing to take the risk.

676
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That risk may be...

677
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Before you have the assessment,

678
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
you don't have the information,

679
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you don't have the concept.

680
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Because after you sleep well,

681
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
you're more mentally prepared to do this.

682
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You need more calculative resources.

683
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Some calculations.

684
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So if you put it that way,

685
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you might be facing some

686
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
risky choices that might benefit you.

687
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Then you'll have a better chance to do it.

688
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Even if it's taking risks,

689
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but it's actually a good decision for you.

690
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think there are actually a lot of

691
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
different scenarios.

692
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It feels like you see this result,

693
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and then you have to come up with a story to explain it.

694
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So actually,

695
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it seems like you have to see different results.

696
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's also quite possible to use...

697
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There may be a lot of contradict results.

698
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's true that it happens a lot.

699
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I think this result is quite interesting.

700
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I can understand what you mean.

701
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Because I've seen a lot of papers.

702
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
They put the risk...

703
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Like you said, it's a lost domain.

704
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
They see risk as a negative thing.

705
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But you're using tolerance here.

706
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So you can understand that

707
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
a person would be more willing to

708
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
take the risk reasonably.

709
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
About those tasks that require risk but are beneficial.

710
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In terms of the nature of our task,

711
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you're actually willing to take the risk.

712
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The expectation is actually higher.

713
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because if we calculate it,

714
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
you always take a safe risk.

715
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Because you get 5 dollars.

716
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But if you calculate the risk-free choice,

717
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
our design is higher than 5 dollars.

718
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Do you have any other questions?

719
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
If you have any questions, you can ask them directly.

720
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I have two questions I want to ask.

721
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think your design is really...

722
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You put a lot of factors into it.

723
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's quite rigorous.

724
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I have two questions I want to ask.

725
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The first one is...

726
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Because the age range of your audience is quite large.

727
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
From 18 to 67 years old.

728
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I imagine that at different ages,

729
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
their life activities would be quite different.

730
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
For example, some people have retired.

731
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Some people are working.

732
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Some people are young and still in school.

733
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Is there a difference in age or gender?

734
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The second question is...

735
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
When I was collecting the demographic,

736
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I was quite curious about

737
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
whether it was related to social status.

738
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I feel that social status also affects

739
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
the degree of risk you can take.

740
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Especially in the financial sector.

741
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Do you think there is a difference in life activities at different ages?

742
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I haven't analyzed this yet.

743
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But I think there should be.

744
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But if you just look at the age and gender variables,

745
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and compare it with the risk-taking behavior,

746
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we can see that people who are older

747
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
are less likely to take risks.

748
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But we don't see a significant difference in gender.

749
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
We did ask more questions about social status.

750
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We asked about their academic background.

751
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
We also asked about their financial status.

752
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We asked a lot of other questions.

753
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The variables I mentioned are not what we asked.

754
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
We have more questions to ask.

755
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But I don't have time to analyze other information.

756
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So I haven't taken a closer look.

757
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But we did ask a lot of questions.

758
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We also asked about their drinking habits.

759
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
We asked about their smoking habits.

760
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We still have a lot of questions.

761
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But we haven't taken a closer look.

762
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Anyone else has a question?

763
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If you have a question, please ask.

764
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Hello.

765
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Can you show us what the app looks like?

766
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, sure.

767
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'd like to take a look.

768
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'll stop sharing my screen

769
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and show you the screenshot.

770
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Okay?

771
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Sorry.

772
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I remember I don't have it in my IRV.

773
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Okay.

774
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
This is what our app looks like.

775
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's like a map.

776
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Can you see it?

777
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yes.

778
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
This number means how many tasks you have to do.

779
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The user can click on it.

780
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
After clicking on it,

781
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
like what I mentioned in the report,

782
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
the rich tasks or surveys.

783
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If you don't complete a task,

784
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
you can get this gem.

785
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You can buy this gem

786
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
to decorate your avatar.

787
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
This is the avatar.

788
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is one of the ways to design your avatar.

789
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It's like completing a journey every week.

790
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
After you complete it,

791
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
you can open this gem.

792
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But this gem doesn't mean anything.

793
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We'll actually give them money.

794
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Every time you complete a journey,

795
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
the map behind it will be different.

796
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
On the left,

797
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
because it hasn't completed these tasks,

798
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the map behind it hasn't been opened yet.

799
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
This one is already done,

800
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
so the map behind it will come out.

801
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It has different styles.

802
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think the interface design is quite beautiful.

803
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I can share the company of this app to you.

804
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:24,000
We use this design app to do experiments.

805
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So it's mainly this data cube app

806
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to do our experiments.

807
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
This is what I just said.

808
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You can design your own style.

809
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You can make the user more engaged.

810
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But the most engaged way is to give them money.

811
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We give them weekly payment for the user fee.

812
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We'll also give them extra bonuses for the tasks we do.

813
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So it's meaningful for them to make those choices.

814
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's not like they're done and that's it.

815
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We really give them a corresponding reward

816
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
based on their choices.

817
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So that's about it.

818
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
If no one has any questions,

819
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I can ask one more question.

820
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm sorry.

821
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I don't think this is a question.

822
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know if you've read

823
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
the Noise book published by Daniel Kahneman last year.

824
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I just read it.

825
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I've heard of it, but I haven't read it.

826
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I strongly recommend it.

827
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I think this research sounds like

828
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
a term invented by him called Occasion Noise.

829
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The difference in decision-making between people

830
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
depends on mood and physiological feedback.

831
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
He mentioned something called

832
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Stable Pattern Noise.

833
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
He said that this is the biggest difference

834
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
in group decision-making.

835
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But there are very few documents being reviewed now.

836
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I just saw that you did age and gender.

837
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You said there's a difference.

838
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm curious.

839
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
When you were reviewing these documents,

840
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
how did you feel?

841
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Why do you think

842
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
this demographic

843
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
is difficult to review

844
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
or study?

845
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That's about it.

846
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I think the difficulty lies in

847
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the fact that this topic

848
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
has a long history.

849
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So there are a lot of documents.

850
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And the most difficult thing

851
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
is what I just said.

852
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
How do you define the so-called risk preference?

853
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Risk preference is a very difficult thing.

854
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It's a very abstract construct.

855
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's not like other things.

856
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I don't know.

857
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But I have to say

858
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
how do you say

859
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
this person's risk preference?

860
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's really hard to measure

861
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
with a single quantitative table.

862
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So if you use different quantitative tables

863
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
to measure,

864
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
you might get different results.

865
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Because what you might ask

866
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
is different from what other people ask.

867
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And the so-called risk

868
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
has a lot of different domains.

869
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
There are a lot of different areas of risk.

870
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I might be a person

871
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
who is very willing to

872
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
ride the cloud car.

873
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But I'm actually very afraid of socializing.

874
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
For example, I may not dare

875
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to publish a different opinion

876
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
in a company.

877
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
These two are actually risks.

878
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But in fact, their areas

879
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
are very unrelated.

880
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So I think

881
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
this is the most difficult part.

882
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's really hard to have

883
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
a unified risk preference definition.

884
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
In addition to what I just said,

885
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
in fact, this topic

886
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
has been studied

887
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
by economists, psychologists,

888
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and psychologists.

889
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
People from different fields

890
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
have different research methods.

891
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The thinking of different research methods

892
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
is very different.

893
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Because this is a very cross-field

894
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and very important research topic.

895
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But everyone's research method is different.

896
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And the face of concern is also different.

897
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So it becomes that there are

898
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
documents everywhere.

899
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There are a lot of documents.

900
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's just that it's really difficult

901
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
to have a single conclusion.

902
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And there are a lot of...

903
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
For example, gender.

904
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
There are a lot of different conclusions

905
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
just about gender.

906
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Even if there is

907
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
that kind of meta-analysis,

908
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
you will find that

909
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
there are actually a lot of

910
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
different conclusions.

911
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So I think this is

912
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
a very difficult place.

913
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm sorry.

914
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I just...

915
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
In that book, it says

916
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that there are very few documents.

917
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
But you just said

918
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
that there are a lot of documents,

919
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
but the conclusions are different.

920
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes.

921
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
What do you mean by

922
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
very few documents?

923
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Can you say that again?

924
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Do you mean gender and age?

925
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Gender and age are your research.

926
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But Conleman said

927
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that it should be considered

928
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
a difference in domain.

929
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Do you mean different risk domains?

930
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yes.

931
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I was originally a very risk-taking person.

932
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I thought you said...

933
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But suddenly...

934
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
If I were a judge,

935
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I was very sensitive.

936
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Then I suddenly saw this person.

937
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I thought of my son.

938
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I was very sensitive.

939
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
He was talking about this.

940
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
OK.

941
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
He said that

942
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
there is less research in this area.

943
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yes.

944
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
What do you mean?

945
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Sorry.

946
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I thought you just said

947
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
gender or that.

948
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Because I think

949
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
this is more like

950
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
the difference in personal experience

951
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
for your risk preferences.

952
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Personal experience,

953
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
or the so-called...

954
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
We actually want to find

955
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
environmental factors

956
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to see if these environmental factors

957
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
affect you.

958
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
But in fact,

959
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I think it's hard to study.

960
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Because it's hard to measure.

961
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's hard to ask too many

962
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
personal questions.

963
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
In addition,

964
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
like we used to study,

965
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
there is very little

966
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
long-term research.

967
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So without long-term research,

968
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
it's hard for you

969
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
to really capture

970
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
the events

971
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
that this person will encounter

972
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
in his life.

973
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Because usually,

974
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
for the example you just mentioned,

975
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
it's a bit like

976
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
this event is very...

977
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
In fact,

978
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
it's quite unique.

979
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's very special.

980
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's like meeting your own child

981
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
and then being sentenced to death.

982
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
This kind of

983
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
personal life experience

984
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
is hard to know.

985
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
In addition,

986
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it's hard to ask

987
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
such a private thing.

988
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
RRB also has to be saved for a long time.

989
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So I think our researchers

990
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
try to work towards that direction.

991
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's just that

992
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
you have to do what you said.

993
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's really...

994
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's an event

995
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
for you.

996
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This kind of

997
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
risk-benefit difference

998
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
is really

999
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
quite difficult to do.

1000
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But gender and age,

1001
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
these two,

1002
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
because it's a more

1003
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
stable factor.

1004
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So many people

1005
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
have done this research.

1006
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Got it.

1007
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Because it talks about

1008
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the environment.

1009
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
For example,

1010
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the weather

1011
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
seems to be

1012
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
less than 10%.

1013
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And then

1014
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
the personality

1015
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
seems to be

1016
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
higher.

1017
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's about 20% to 30%.

1018
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So...

1019
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm sorry.

1020
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
At the moment,

1021
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
the related personality

1022
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
has a higher

1023
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
risk-benefit ratio.

1024
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Is the current research

1025
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
relatively easier to do?

1026
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
There are quite a few.

1027
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But I think...

1028
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I think it's mainly

1029
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
like what I just said.

1030
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It depends.

1031
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
If you are a psychologist,

1032
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
you may not be so interested

1033
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
in the personality.

1034
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So it depends

1035
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
on who is doing the research.

1036
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Psychologists

1037
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
may be very interested in this.

1038
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So...

1039
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
There's another thing.

1040
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
If you want to know

1041
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
the risk-benefit ratio,

1042
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
you need to know

1043
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the impact

1044
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
of this risk-benefit ratio

1045
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
on the next action.

1046
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
What's the next action?

1047
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Everyone cares about

1048
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
different things.

1049
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So...

1050
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
To answer your question,

1051
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
there are a lot of researches

1052
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
on the personality

1053
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and risk-benefit ratio.

1054
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
But what's the point

1055
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
of this research?

1056
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It depends on

1057
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
what you want to ask.

1058
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Okay, thank you.

1059
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So...

1060
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
About the reference documents...

1061
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't think I saw...

1062
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I think you...

1063
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I think I posted it

1064
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
on my personal website.

1065
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Is it not completed yet?

1066
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Because I want to...

1067
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You mean this research?

1068
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yes, the reference documents.

1069
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
If you want,

1070
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I can send it to you.

1071
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I've finished

1072
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
a manuscript.

1073
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But...

1074
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
This research

1075
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
is...

1076
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I posted

1077
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Nature Communication.

1078
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
After reviewing it,

1079
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
it was rejected.

1080
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So I'm reviewing it now.

1081
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I hope to post the next one.

1082
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I want to change it.

1083
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I want to share

1084
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
my manuscript

1085
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
in public.

1086
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So I'm still changing it.

1087
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So I didn't...

1088
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
At least on our lab website,

1089
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I didn't post it.

1090
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But if you want,

1091
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I can send it to you.

1092
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay.

1093
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Thank you.

1094
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's about it.

1095
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I can put

1096
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
my email

1097
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
in my chat.

1098
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
If you want,

1099
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I can send it to you.

1100
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I think there was a question

1101
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
in the chat.

1102
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
How to raise your hand?

1103
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Was the question answered?

1104
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm sorry.

1105
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I didn't notice the message.

1106
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Is that person still there?

1107
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Found it.

1108
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Is there anyone else?

1109
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay.

1110
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Thank you.

1111
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Thank you.

1112
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Thank you.

1113
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Thank you.

1114
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
If no one has a question,

1115
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'll ask the last question.

1116
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
No one has a question?

1117
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Right.

1118
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Like...

1119
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
In experimental economics,

1120
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
if you want to control

1121
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
the risk,

1122
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
to see the impact of the risk,

1123
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
or to control the risk

1124
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
in the lab,

1125
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
do you usually use

1126
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
hold and load retax to test it?

1127
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You've seen so many tasks.

1128
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Do you think there is

1129
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
a better alternative

1130
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
or suggestion?

1131
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
If it's based on

1132
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
the teacher's idea,

1133
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
the task I'm doing now,

1134
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
it's relatively simple.

1135
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Because it controls one of the options.

1136
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Always is the same.

1137
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You just change it.

1138
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But you just said that

1139
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
the numbers on both sides will change.

1140
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It makes the task easier.

1141
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So...

1142
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Maybe...

1143
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
There won't be problems

1144
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
caused by the task itself.

1145
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Because I know some researches

1146
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
say that some tasks

1147
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
are too difficult,

1148
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
so they can't be calculated.

1149
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Our...

1150
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Our task

1151
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
is designed differently.

1152
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
One option is very simple,

1153
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and the other...

1154
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's only one variable.

1155
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But...

1156
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I can't say that

1157
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
it's the best option.

1158
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So...

1159
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I think...

1160
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Experimental economists

1161
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
have been developing

1162
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
new experiments.

1163
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So...

1164
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
For us,

1165
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
we want to simplify

1166
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
the experiment.

1167
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Thank you.

1168
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Any other questions?

1169
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If not,

1170
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
it's time to

1171
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
say goodbye.

1172
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Thank you, Ziyun.

1173
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Thank you, everyone.

1174
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Let's...

1175
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Let's...

1176
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Let's...

1177
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Let's stop here.
