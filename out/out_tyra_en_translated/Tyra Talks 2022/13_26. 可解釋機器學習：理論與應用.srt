1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Can you see it now?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OK.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm John Yu-nan.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can call me Alan.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm a Ph.D. student at Rice University.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm studying computer science.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm in my second year.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm doing research on

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
interpretable machinery

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or explainable artificial intelligence.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My goal is to explain

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
why this machine learning model

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
can make such predictions.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to explain

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and convince people

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that this prediction result

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is not random.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OK.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me introduce myself.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I used to study in Taiwan.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm a master's student.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I used to work in

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a recommendation system.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you have questions

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
about the recommendation system,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you can ask me.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll try to answer them.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
OK.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I studied math in college.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Before I graduated from

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
my senior year,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I didn't know how to code.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't even understand

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a line of code.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I want to encourage

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
those who still want to code

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
not to give up.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Everyone has a chance.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Keep working hard.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everyone has a chance

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to do this.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OK.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today,

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to talk about

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I just want to say

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
it's too inspirational at the beginning.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Anyway,

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not a master today.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm just an ordinary

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
sophomore PhD student.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you want to interrupt me,

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
just turn on your microphone

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and interrupt me.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
OK.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's get started.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OK.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Today's outline

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
focuses on four points.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
First,

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
explainable artificial intelligence.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Next,

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
explainable machine learning.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Next,

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
explainable machine learning.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There are two types of machine learning.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
First,

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
explainable machine learning.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
For example,

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you may have heard of

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
decision tree.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
In decision tree,

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we can see

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the model itself

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is explainable.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is explainable.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The other type is

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
neural network.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The other type is

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
deep neural network.

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's fully connected.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's fully connected.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's a black box model.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's not explainable.

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't know

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the learning weight.

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't know the learning weight.

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You don't know the learning weight.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't know the learning weight.

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So,

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
we need an explanation

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
after learning the model.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
After learning the model,

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we need to learn

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
an explanation model

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to explain the model.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This type of learning method

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
is called post hoc.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
post hoc is after prediction process.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
OK.

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
After this,

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to talk about

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the application of XAI.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you are not a computer science

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
background,

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you may wonder

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
what's the use of XAI.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to talk about

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the open source package

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to make an explainable model.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to make an explainable model.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, everyone uses Python.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to talk about

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
two open source packages.

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to tell you

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
what is XAI.

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
XAI is not an unimaginable thing.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you have a prediction model,

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and you want to make it explainable,

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
everyone has a chance

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to step into this field.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
OK.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now,

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to talk about

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
what is XAI.

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Artificial intelligence

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
has many applications

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in our daily life.

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
For example,

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
deep mind

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
has created AlphaGo

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to play Go.

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It can scare

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
human experts.

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A while ago,

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
deep mind gave

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
AlphaTensor and

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AlphaProtein.

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In fact,

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
they are for reinforcement learning.

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They are for

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
reinforcement learning.

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They can be applied

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in daily life.

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
For example,

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
medical diagnosis.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For example,

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I give you an X-ray,

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and you hope the machine learning model

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
can tell if you have a brain tumor.

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Then it will tell you

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
if you have a brain tumor.

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Or you can tell

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the machine learning model

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
if you have a cough

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
or symptoms.

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Tesla Autopilot

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is an

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
autonomous vehicle.

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It will not detect

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
any object.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It will give you the best way

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to drive the car.

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Next is voice recognition.

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
For example, Alexa.

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know if you have used

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
a smart speaker.

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When you speak to the speaker,

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
it will detect your voice

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and convert it

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to English.

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then it will

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
request the service

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
from the online server.

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Recently,

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
there is a popular

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
speech-to-speech

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in Meta.

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This kind of

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
AI application

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
is becoming more and more common.

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is hard for us

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to know why

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
these models make these judgments.

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
For example,

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you go to a doctor

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and he presented a

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
medical diagnosis model.

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You input all your symptoms

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
into this model.

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He will say,

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you just have a cold today.

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why do you make this judgment?

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Or if Tesla gives you

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the best

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
autonomous driving

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
route plan,

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
do you really think

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
he won't be in trouble?

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In this decision-making process,

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
if you can provide

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
what features

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
this model learned today,

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
or if it senses

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
a pedestrian passing by

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and stops,

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
or if it detects a green light

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in front of it.

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If this kind of

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
why process is provided to users,

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it can actually

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
increase people's

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
credibility in

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
machine learning models.

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So,

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the whole XAI

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is actually doing one thing.

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It wants to provide

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
a reasonable reason to users.

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
For example,

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
what features did this model learn?

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or what did this model see?

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or did this model learn

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
two or three features

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that led me to make

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this prediction result?

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
XAI is improving

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
this process.

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For example,

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
this autopilot on the left.

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What does XAI want to do?

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We actually want to provide

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
why this autopilot

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
will give you

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
a safe route plan.

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, you have to tell users

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
that because my model

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
detects people,

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
my model detects

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
no cars within 50 meters.

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For example,

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the medical diagnosis

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
on the right.

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The medical diagnosis

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is like

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
persuading a doctor

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
or a patient

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that because I

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
see a tumor

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in the X-ray of your brain,

254
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I frame it,

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
so I judge your brain tumor.

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This action

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
doesn't seem

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so necessary

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
in the whole

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
prediction process.

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But if you provide

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
this step to users,

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
why this step,

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
users will feel

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
very confident

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
about your decision

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
model.

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course, there are many applications

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that I haven't mentioned,

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
such as stock market trading.

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
For example, if you buy

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a stock,

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the price of the stock

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
has already fallen

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to the point of fracture.

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you sell the stock,

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the price will not

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
fall below $100.

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If the model is wrong,

280
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it will ask you to sell it

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
because the price of the stock

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
may fall below $100.

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You have to convince

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the trader

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
that because I see

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
a tumor

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
in the X-ray of your brain,

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
your prediction model

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is credible.

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There are several points

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
related to this.

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
First, you have to convince users.

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Second, you have to provide security.

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Another important thing

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is some legal things,

296
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
such as GDPR.

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A while ago,

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Facebook was called

299
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to the European Parliament

300
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
or Google CEO

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
was called to the U.S.

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
House of Representatives

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
was called to scold.

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In fact,

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
these privacy data

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or personal data

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
are not provided

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
to users

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
in a reasonable

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or safe way.

311
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can't use these features

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
unconditionally

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
as a basis

314
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
for training models.

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you can provide these methods

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to users through XAI

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and say

318
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I use these features

319
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
today

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and provide you

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
some personal

322
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
recommendations or predictions.

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In fact, users

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
will be more at ease

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that you have used these things.

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Even if it is privacy data,

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it is better than

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
using XAI.

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is the reason

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
why XAI has attracted

331
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
more and more people

332
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
in the past 1 or 2 years

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
or 3 or 4 years.

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
OK.

335
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Next,

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
those are

337
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
some high-level

338
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
things.

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's talk about

340
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
some

341
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
more

342
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
scientific things.

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If we are doing

344
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
image classification,

345
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
we are judging

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the model

347
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
whether it is good or not.

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We are training

349
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
a model of image classification.

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We can't say

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
this model

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is good or not.

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Of course, we can say

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
it is a prediction.

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For example,

356
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
we can predict

357
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the label of this image.

358
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
However,

359
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
we can say

360
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
this image is a frog.

361
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Does this model

362
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
really learn the characteristics of a frog?

363
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In other words,

364
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
does it really learn

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the head of a frog?

366
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Does it really learn

367
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the head of a frog?

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No one knows.

369
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It may learn

370
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that most of the frog images

371
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
are because the frog

372
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
stands on the pond and the lotus.

373
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So it catches the characteristics

374
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
of the pond and the lotus.

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We don't know this.

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why?

377
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When a model like this

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
learns the model of

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
pond and frog,

380
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
will it predict the wrong?

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We don't know this.

382
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Through this AI,

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
we can see

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
which part is important.

385
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In the end,

386
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if we get the final explanation

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that the reason

388
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the model is a frog

389
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
is because it has

390
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
a very representative head,

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
then we know

392
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this model is actually learning

393
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the right direction,

394
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
instead of catching some

395
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
background loopholes

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
or shortcuts

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
to improve

398
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the AI.

399
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
For example,

400
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
let's say

401
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
there is a test

402
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to see if you are

403
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a COVID classifier.

404
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
As we all know,

405
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
there is a high probability

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that you have a fever or a sore throat.

407
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's say you only have a cold.

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you only have a fever

409
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
or a sore throat,

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the test says you are a COVID classifier.

411
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then you are panicking.

412
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If we want to

413
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
judge whether

414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the machine learning model

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
really learns

416
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
the features we want,

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
for example,

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
we provide some X-ray photos.

419
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It will say that

420
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the COVID diagnosis

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is not only based on

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the two features,

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
sore throat and fever.

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If we

425
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
provide

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
this prediction result

427
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to the user,

428
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
we can detect

429
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the features

430
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and the user

431
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
will be happier.

432
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

433
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's drink some water.

434
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
To sum up,

435
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
AI and XAI

436
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
are actually

437
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
a cycle

438
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
of prediction.

439
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If we don't have

440
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
AI prediction,

441
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
we don't need to

442
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
detect the features.

443
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
XAI will not appear.

444
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
XAI is

445
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
mainly

446
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
trained by

447
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
a model.

448
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The prediction model

449
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
has the ability to detect

450
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the features.

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You can see

452
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
a dog here.

453
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There is a prediction model here.

454
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It detects that it is a dog.

455
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why?

456
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe the dog is lying on the ground.

457
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Most dogs are lying on the ground.

458
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I learned the features

459
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
on the side.

460
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It detects that it is a dog.

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Or maybe

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
it is orange.

463
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It detects that it is a dog.

464
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We don't know.

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It is a black box model.

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We need another

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
XAI model

468
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to open the black box.

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We need another XAI model

470
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to open the black box.

471
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then we can see

472
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
why the picture is a dog.

473
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because the dog has thin eyes

474
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and special ears.

475
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because of the learning

476
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
of this feature,

477
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the picture is

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
judged to be a dog.

479
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
At this time,

480
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
XAI model is very credible.

481
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because we know

482
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
it learns in the right direction.

483
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Instead of

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
learning other features

485
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
to create the prediction result.

486
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This model,

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
prediction model,

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is more credible.

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
OK.

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That was

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
an explanation of

492
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
a big concept of XAI.

493
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go deeper.

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I am not sure

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if you are all

496
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
CS background students,

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
professors,

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
or PhD students.

499
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Today,

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am going to give a high-level

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
talk.

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We are going to

503
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
learn more about

504
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
the current

505
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
XAI

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
SOTA techniques

507
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to execute

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the explanation.

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
OK.

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Before that,

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
let's take a look

512
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
at the different scopes.

513
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There are global and local.

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I am going to talk about

515
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the global.

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We are looking at the model.

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
For example,

518
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the image classifier

519
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
in total

520
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
cares about the features.

521
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
For example,

522
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
let's train

523
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
a model

524
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
for dog

525
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
classifier.

526
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We want to know

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
what this model cares about.

528
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
For example,

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
dogs have different ears.

530
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So, ears are the features

531
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
this model cares about.

532
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is the global scope.

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What is local?

534
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Local is to explain

535
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
what each image cares about.

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
For example,

537
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
if we want to

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
do the global,

539
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
we have to look at the classifier

540
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
in all dogs.

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What features does it care about?

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But in the local scope,

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
we have to look at

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
each image.

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This image cares about

546
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the dog's face.

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This image cares about

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the dog's tail or ears.

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In the local scope,

550
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
each image cares about

551
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
each image.

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Each has its own advantages.

553
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If we want to look at

554
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
whether this model is credible,

555
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we can use global.

556
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
For example,

557
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
in total,

558
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the autopilot model

559
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
detects

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
traffic lights,

561
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
pedestrians,

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or obstacles

563
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
on the road.

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
In total,

565
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
we use global.

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
In the local scope,

567
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
in this scene,

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in this second,

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the sensor detects

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
this street scene.

571
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because it has something,

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
it can provide something in the next second.

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When we analyze

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the street scene

575
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
every second,

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we have to use the local model.

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The local model

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
provides a more

579
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
restrictive

580
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
explanation to the user.

581
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is global and local.

582
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Next, there are two

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
different manners.

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
One is intrinsic and the other is post-hoc.

585
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Intrinsic means

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the model itself has something to explain.

587
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What is something to explain?

588
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
For example,

589
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
decision tree.

590
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
At the end,

591
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the model predicts the result is C.

592
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We can start from C

593
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and go back to C.

594
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
For example,

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
when the model makes a decision,

596
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
what are the conditions

597
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
to reach the

598
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
final prediction result?

599
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The model itself

600
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
has something to explain.

601
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We can know

602
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
from the model's decision

603
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
what features it has

604
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
or what condition it has.

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is the intrinsic model.

606
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
On the right,

607
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
if you have heard

608
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
some Machine Learning lectures

609
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or courses,

610
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
you should know about BERT.

611
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
In BERT,

612
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
there is a

613
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
tension score

614
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
for each word

615
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
in the model.

616
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
For example,

617
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I put a sentence

618
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in the BERT model.

619
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
For each word,

620
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
there is a positive or negative sentiment.

621
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Each word

622
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
has an added value

623
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
in terms of

624
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
positive or negative sentiment.

625
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
For example,

626
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
love is positive.

627
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Love is a positive

628
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
tense.

629
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This

630
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
high-level

631
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
contribution

632
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
is the tension weight

633
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
in the model.

634
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So we can use

635
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the importance of words

636
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
in terms of

637
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
model prediction

638
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to determine

639
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
why this sentence

640
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
is a

641
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
positive

642
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
prediction result.

643
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We can use

644
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
the importance score

645
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to make the prediction result.

646
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The two models

647
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I just talked about

648
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
are Intrinsic

649
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and Prediction.

650
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Next is

651
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Post-Hoc.

652
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I will talk about

653
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
why I focus on

654
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Post-Hoc.

655
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Most

656
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
machine learning models

657
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
use black box models.

658
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
For example,

659
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I build a deep learning network

660
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and stack some blocks

661
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and

662
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
connect them to

663
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
a convolution.

664
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
These prediction models

665
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
have good results,

666
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but I don't know

667
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
what they do inside.

668
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
For example, I don't know

669
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
what features they learn.

670
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This black box learning

671
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
requires

672
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Post-Hoc.

673
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
After the model training,

674
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I need to provide an

675
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
explanation

676
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
for the prediction model.

677
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This model

678
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
is common

679
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
in daily life.

680
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
For example,

681
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
let's build a

682
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
recommendation system.

683
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We use

684
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
neural network

685
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to train the model.

686
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
At this time,

687
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the recommendation system

688
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is not explainable.

689
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So we need a

690
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
explainable model

691
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
to explain the model.

692
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The Post-Hoc model

693
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
has two scopes.

694
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
One is global,

695
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the other is local.

696
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
For the global model,

697
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I need to see

698
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
what features

699
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the neural network

700
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
focuses on.

701
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
For the local model,

702
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the neural network

703
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
focuses on

704
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
18 years old,

705
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
male,

706
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Asian,

707
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Chinese,

708
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and Taiwanese.

709
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So I need

710
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
a high level

711
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
model.

712
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Each model

713
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
has different features.

714
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I need to provide

715
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
different models

716
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
for each model.

717
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
In conclusion,

718
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
these two models

719
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
are the mainstream.

720
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Intrinsic and Post-Hoc.

721
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Today,

722
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I will focus on

723
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the Post-Hoc explanation.

724
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Later on,

725
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I will focus on

726
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
the local model.

727
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Local model is

728
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
common in daily life.

729
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
For example,

730
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
the recommendation system.

731
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
OK.

732
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now,

733
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
let's talk about

734
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Intrinsic and Local.

735
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Here is a picture.

736
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is an article.

737
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
For example,

738
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I say this article

739
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
is important.

740
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Why?

741
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because it detects

742
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
ENT23 or

743
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
natural tenacity.

744
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So,

745
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
through this,

746
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I can tell

747
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
which word is important.

748
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I can tell

749
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
users

750
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
why I use this article

751
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to make a prediction.

752
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's because

753
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
my model detects

754
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
ENT23

755
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
or natural tenacity.

756
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This way,

757
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
users can be convinced

758
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that their prediction

759
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is correct.

760
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
OK.

761
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is

762
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
what Intrinsic

763
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
provides.

764
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
OK.

765
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What is Intrinsic Global?

766
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
As I said,

767
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Global focuses on

768
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the model.

769
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
For example,

770
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
we design a CNN model

771
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
which is

772
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
a representation

773
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
of image classification.

774
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
OK.

775
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Why does CNN

776
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
successfully detect

777
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the image of a cat?

778
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's because

779
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it detects the cat's head.

780
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If we extract

781
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
a layer

782
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
of model weight

783
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
from CNN,

784
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
we can see

785
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
that this model

786
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
does a convolution

787
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to some features

788
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
resulting in

789
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
a model prediction.

790
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
OK.

791
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
If we extract

792
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
this feature map

793
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
from the model,

794
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
users can see

795
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that

796
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
their prediction

797
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
is correct.

798
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This is

799
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
the process

800
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
of Intrinsic.

801
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Intrinsic is

802
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
a model

803
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
which has

804
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
a function

805
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to make a prediction.

806
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Or a model

807
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
can extract

808
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
a component

809
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
to make a prediction.

810
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This is

811
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the process of Intrinsic.

812
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
OK.

813
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The other thing

814
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
we focus on

815
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
is PostHoc Explanation.

816
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PostHoc Explanation

817
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is divided into two steps.

818
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The first step is

819
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the black box model,

820
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
which is our prediction model.

821
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We have data and model

822
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to train.

823
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The next step is

824
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the explainer,

825
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
which is our machine learning

826
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
model to explain

827
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the prediction model.

828
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
OK.

829
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Then we need

830
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to know

831
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
whether the explainer

832
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is correct or not.

833
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We don't need to

834
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
trust the explainer.

835
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We can use

836
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
many different metrics

837
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to determine

838
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
whether the explainer

839
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
is correct or not.

840
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The most famous metric

841
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
is the sharp E-value.

842
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If you have

843
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
a background in economics

844
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
you need to calculate

845
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
the contribution of each feature

846
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
to the prediction model.

847
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We use

848
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
the sharp E-value

849
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
in Game Theory

850
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to create

851
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the correct answer

852
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and do the evaluation.

853
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
OK.

854
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The explainer has many

855
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
methods, such as SHARP

856
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and LIME.

857
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
These methods

858
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
have one

859
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
big drawback.

860
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
If we want to do

861
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
the local explanation,

862
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
we need to provide

863
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
an explanation for each picture.

864
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The most common

865
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
method

866
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
is to

867
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
provide

868
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
an explanation

869
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for each picture.

870
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We need to have

871
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
100,000 pictures

872
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
to provide

873
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
an explanation for each picture.

874
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We need to provide

875
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
an explanation for each picture.

876
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
This process

877
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
is very slow.

878
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
These methods

879
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
have some drawbacks.

880
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Of course,

881
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
some people say

882
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we have a good

883
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
SHARP

884
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and Game Theory

885
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I will explain

886
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
why we can't

887
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
use SHARP

888
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to provide an explanation.

889
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
OK.

890
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What is SHARP E-Value?

891
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
SHARP E-Value

892
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
is a tool

893
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to provide

894
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
an explanation

895
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
for model prediction.

896
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
To create SHARP E-Value,

897
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we need to know

898
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the important score

899
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
of each feature.

900
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We need to know

901
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
the important score

902
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
of each feature.

903
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What do we need to do

904
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to know the important score

905
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
of each feature?

906
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's simple.

907
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's say

908
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
we have 4 features.

909
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

910
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We need to know

911
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
the important score

912
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
of each feature.

913
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We need to know

914
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
the important score

915
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
of each feature.

916
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
For example,

917
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
we need to know

918
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the important score

919
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
of Job and

920
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Marital Status.

921
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We need to know

922
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
the important score

923
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
of each feature.

924
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We need to use

925
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the only combination

926
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
of all features.

927
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We need to use

928
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the only combination

929
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
of all features.

930
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
For example,

931
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
we need to use

932
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the only combination

933
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
of Job and Marital Status.

934
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We need to know

935
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the important score

936
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
of each feature

937
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
in the Sharp Eval.

938
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
What will happen?

939
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If there are only

940
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
5 features,

941
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
all combinations

942
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
will be 2 to the power of 5.

943
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So, it's 2 to the power of 5.

944
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
If I have

945
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
2,000 features

946
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
in the recommendation system

947
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
in a big company,

948
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it will be 2 to the power of 2,000.

949
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
A user needs

950
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
2 to the power of 2,000.

951
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I have 1 billion users

952
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
today.

953
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The calculation process

954
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is endless.

955
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So,

956
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
why can't we use the Sharp Eval?

957
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's an NP-hard problem.

958
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Its complexity

959
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is too high.

960
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We can't use

961
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
a low-complexity method

962
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to verify

963
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
our calculations.

964
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So,

965
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
we use the word

966
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Sharp Eval

967
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
to explain

968
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the important score.

969
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's possible, but not realistic.

970
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Why?

971
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It takes too much time

972
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and complexity

973
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
to calculate.

974
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So,

975
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
we can't use it.

976
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh, I forgot to mention

977
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the following.

978
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
For example,

979
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I only care about Job and Marito.

980
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If I remove the other three,

981
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
what will happen

982
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
to my model prediction?

983
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What will happen

984
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to my model prediction?

985
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If I remove

986
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Balance, Job,

987
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and Marito,

988
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and only consider Age and Education

989
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
in my prediction model,

990
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
the prediction result

991
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
can't be returned,

992
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but it can be returned.

993
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What does it mean?

994
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
These three features are important.

995
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So,

996
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
we can use

997
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
this iterative process

998
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to find

999
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
the important score

1000
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
for each feature.

1001
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is Sharp Eval.

1002
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
If you know economics,

1003
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you will feel

1004
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
this is quite

1005
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
intimate.

1006
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
OK.

1007
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
If we can't use

1008
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Sharp Eval,

1009
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
what can we do?

1010
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This is my research.

1011
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I want to

1012
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
speed up

1013
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the process of

1014
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
explanation.

1015
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Because

1016
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
when we do

1017
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
local explanation,

1018
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
each user must

1019
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
provide a customized

1020
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
explanation result.

1021
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
As I mentioned,

1022
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
each customized explanation

1023
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
is a model

1024
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to explain the prediction model.

1025
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
This process

1026
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
takes a lot of time.

1027
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
For example,

1028
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
if you give a recommended result

1029
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and ask the user to wait

1030
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
10 seconds,

1031
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
the user can't

1032
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
accept it.

1033
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If you ask the user to wait

1034
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
10 seconds,

1035
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the user will click

1036
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
the upper left corner.

1037
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
This is the work

1038
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I did last year.

1039
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This work

1040
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
aims to

1041
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
speed up

1042
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the operation of

1043
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Sharp Eval

1044
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and provide the

1045
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
user with an

1046
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
explanation result.

1047
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
As I mentioned,

1048
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I want to

1049
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
go through all the combinations

1050
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
of the feature set.

1051
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
For example,

1052
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
each feature set

1053
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
is important to the model,

1054
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
isn't it?

1055
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Some features

1056
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
are not important

1057
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to the model.

1058
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Can we get this information

1059
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
after training the model?

1060
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yes, we can.

1061
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We can take out

1062
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the weight of the model

1063
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and see that

1064
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
feature 1 and feature 2

1065
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
are not important.

1066
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Feature 1 and feature 3

1067
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
are not important.

1068
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Feature 1 and feature 5

1069
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
are not important at all.

1070
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We can take out

1071
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
feature 1 and feature 5

1072
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
from the combination

1073
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
of Sharp Eval.

1074
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
For example,

1075
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
we want to have

1076
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
2 squares,

1077
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
so we need 32 squares.

1078
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We can take out

1079
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the number of times

1080
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that we need to calculate.

1081
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It may be 2, 2, 4, 6, 8,

1082
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
4, 5, 4, 2... 14 times.

1083
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's actually half the process.

1084
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This process can

1085
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
speed up the calculation

1086
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
of Sharp Eval

1087
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and turn this into

1088
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
a user's acceptable

1089
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
waiting time.

1090
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Finally, provide the user

1091
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
with a faster

1092
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
explanation result.

1093
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This mathematician

1094
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
is actually expressing that

1095
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
in Sharp Eval,

1096
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
we need to go through

1097
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
all the features.

1098
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We turn it into

1099
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the importance of

1100
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the interaction between

1101
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
feature and feature

1102
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
through the weight of the model.

1103
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We take out the unimportant

1104
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and calculate the approximate

1105
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Sharp Eval.

1106
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We take this Sharp Eval

1107
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and provide the important score

1108
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
of the explanation to the user.

1109
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is the spirit

1110
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
of this work.

1111
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
As you can see,

1112
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
this work

1113
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
has an application scenario.

1114
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Today, we trained

1115
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
a prediction model

1116
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
to predict

1117
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
whether the income

1118
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
is high or low.

1119
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
We can use our model

1120
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to explain the trained

1121
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
prediction model

1122
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and then provide

1123
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
the reason.

1124
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
For example,

1125
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
if you are a part-time worker,

1126
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
you will be judged

1127
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
as a high-paying worker.

1128
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This model

1129
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
can be used

1130
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
in a faster way

1131
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
to provide

1132
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
an explanation

1133
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
to the user.

1134
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You can see

1135
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the blue bar on the left

1136
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is the

1137
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
ground truth

1138
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sharp Eval.

1139
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We use the method of

1140
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
economics and theory

1141
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
to calculate the

1142
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Sharp Eval value

1143
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
for this feature.

1144
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
As you can see,

1145
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
even if we take out

1146
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
the unimportant feature

1147
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and interaction,

1148
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
the Sharp Eval

1149
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
score

1150
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
is very close to

1151
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the Sharp Eval.

1152
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We can't say it's exactly the same

1153
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
because we took out

1154
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
some combinations.

1155
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's faster,

1156
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
but we don't lose

1157
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the Sharp Eval accuracy.

1158
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
When we provide

1159
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the importance of each feature

1160
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to the user,

1161
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
we can say that

1162
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
for our model,

1163
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
whether it's high-paying

1164
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
or low-paying,

1165
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
we can provide

1166
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
the score

1167
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
or the important

1168
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
ranking result

1169
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
to the user

1170
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
as a reference

1171
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
for whether

1172
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
they want to believe

1173
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the prediction model.

1174
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The next step

1175
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
is to

1176
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
speed up

1177
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the calculation

1178
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
of the Sharp Eval.

1179
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Instead of

1180
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
speeding up the process,

1181
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
we can train

1182
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
a model to learn

1183
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
the distribution

1184
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
of the Sharp Eval.

1185
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
This can

1186
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
provide

1187
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
a faster

1188
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
prediction result.

1189
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Why?

1190
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
For a traditional

1191
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
DNN model,

1192
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
each user

1193
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
needs a

1194
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
customized result,

1195
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so we need

1196
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
an explanation model.

1197
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
To predict 100,000 users,

1198
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
we need 100,000 models.

1199
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Here, we only need

1200
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
one model

1201
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to predict all users'

1202
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
explanation results.

1203
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This process

1204
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
is what we call

1205
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
an explanation process.

1206
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Why?

1207
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
For a deep learning

1208
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
network,

1209
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
we can send 100,000 users

1210
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
as data

1211
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
to the network

1212
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and the network

1213
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
will produce 100,000 different results.

1214
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We don't

1215
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
need

1216
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
an independent

1217
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
explainer

1218
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
to

1219
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
respond to all users.

1220
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
This training

1221
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
process is another

1222
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
part of my work.

1223
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It is about

1224
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
whether we can

1225
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
learn from

1226
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
positive and negative

1227
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
samples.

1228
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
For example,

1229
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
if we

1230
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
cover up

1231
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
an important feature

1232
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
such as

1233
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
a dog's eye,

1234
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
the model will

1235
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
still make the same

1236
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
prediction

1237
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
when it

1238
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
detects

1239
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
a dog.

1240
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
This can

1241
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
help us

1242
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
explain.

1243
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
For example,

1244
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
we want a model

1245
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
to detect a dog.

1246
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We can give

1247
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
an explanation

1248
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
that the dog

1249
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
cares about

1250
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
these features,

1251
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
so the model will

1252
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
make the same prediction.

1253
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
We can also give

1254
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
a negative example.

1255
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
For example,

1256
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
the model will

1257
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
know that

1258
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
the dog's

1259
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
negative sample

1260
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
is a dog.

1261
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
When the model

1262
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
detects positive

1263
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and negative samples,

1264
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
we can learn from

1265
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the model.

1266
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
We want the model

1267
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
to get closer to

1268
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
the positive sample

1269
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and further away from

1270
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the negative sample.

1271
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
This process

1272
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
is called

1273
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
contrastive learning.

1274
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We want to know

1275
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
what is right

1276
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and what is wrong.

1277
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
We want to

1278
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
have a better

1279
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
distance between

1280
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
right and wrong.

1281
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Why is there

1282
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
a fine-tuning process?

1283
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It is because

1284
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
the shoppy value

1285
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
has a strong

1286
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
support of

1287
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
economic theory,

1288
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
so

1289
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
if we can

1290
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
create

1291
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
important scores

1292
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
that have

1293
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
shoppy value,

1294
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
we can

1295
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
provide

1296
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
at least

1297
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
to

1298
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
machine learning engineers

1299
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
or higher-ups

1300
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
to evaluate

1301
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
whether the

1302
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
explanation is

1303
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
believable.

1304
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
First, we can make

1305
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
people happier.

1306
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Second, we

1307
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
want to keep

1308
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
shoppy value

1309
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
away from

1310
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
fine-tuning.

1311
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
We don't

1312
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
use any

1313
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
shoppy value

1314
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
as a label.

1315
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We can use

1316
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
shoppy value

1317
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
as a label

1318
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to keep

1319
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
shoppy value

1320
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
away from

1321
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
explanation.

1322
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We can use

1323
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
the result

1324
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to make people

1325
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
believe that

1326
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we are not

1327
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
creating

1328
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
important scores

1329
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
randomly,

1330
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
so

1331
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
we can

1332
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
make people

1333
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
happy.

1334
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Third, we

1335
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
want to

1336
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
keep shoppy value

1337
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
away from

1338
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
fine-tuning.

1339
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We don't

1340
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
use any

1341
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
shoppy value

1342
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
as a label.

1343
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
We can

1344
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
keep

1345
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
shoppy value

1346
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
away from

1347
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
fine-tuning.

1348
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We can

1349
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
keep

1350
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
shoppy value

1351
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
away from

1352
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
fine-tuning.

1353
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We can

1354
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
keep

1355
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
shoppy value

1356
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
away from

1357
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
fine-tuning.

1358
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We can

1359
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
keep

1360
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
shoppy value

1361
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
away from

1362
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
fine-tuning.

1363
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We can

1364
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
keep

1365
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
shoppy value

1366
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
away from

1367
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
fine-tuning.

1368
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We can

1369
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
keep

1370
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
shoppy value

1371
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
away from

1372
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
fine-tuning.

1373
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
We can

1374
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
keep

1375
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
shoppy value

1376
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
away from

1377
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
fine-tuning.

1378
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
We can

1379
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
keep

1380
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
shoppy value

1381
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
away from

1382
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
fine-tuning.

1383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We can

1384
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
keep

1385
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
shoppy value

1386
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
away from

1387
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
fine-tuning.

1388

01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
asked about

1995
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
mask size.

1996
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Mask size?

1997
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You mean

1998
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
the size of the mask?

1999
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yes.

2000
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
For example,

2001
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
a dog's eyes.

2002
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
If

2003
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
your mask

2004
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
is

2005
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
smaller than the eyes,

2006
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
this mask is valid.

2007
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
OK.

2008
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
When we do this,

2009
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
we can't

2010
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
make it smaller than the nose.

2011
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
For example,

2012
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
if you ask

2013
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the size of the mask,

2014
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
we don't

2015
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
restrict

2016
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
the mask size.

2017
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But I know

2018
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
someone restricts

2019
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
the mask size.

2020
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Why?

2021
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
If the mask size is too large,

2022
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
it will cause

2023
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
a negative effect.

2024
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Or

2025
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
it has different

2026
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
purposes.

2027
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Or

2028
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
it only selects

2029
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
a few important features.

2030
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
If the mask size is

2031
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
too small,

2032
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
it will cause

2033
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
a negative effect.

2034
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
But if the mask size

2035
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
is the same as

2036
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
the original image,

2037
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
it will cause a negative effect.

2038
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
OK.

2039
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Do you have any questions?

2040
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
OK. Thank you.

2041
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I think it depends on the person.

2042
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
For example,

2043
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
if the mask size

2044
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
is

2045
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
the smallest

2046
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
feature

2047
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
of the eye,

2048
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
it will exceed

2049
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
a pixel.

2050
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I don't know.

2051
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I don't know how to answer this question.

2052
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Or

2053
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
sometimes I feel

2054
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
the size choice

2055
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
is subjective.

2056
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
This choice

2057
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
is made by someone.

2058
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Someone

2059
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
knows

2060
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
the components

2061
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
are large.

2062
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
For example, the eyes are large.

2063
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
For example, the mask

2064
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
is not random for every pixel.

2065
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It is random for every 4x4 pixel.

2066
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Random for every 6x6 pixel.

2067
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Someone

2068
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
does it this way.

2069
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
But I think

2070
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
we don't know

2071
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the pixel model cares about.

2072
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
It may be the upper right and lower left

2073
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
or the upper left and lower right.

2074
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Something like this.

2075
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
If we give such a strong assumption,

2076
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I think model training

2077
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
will be difficult.

2078
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
This explanation model

2079
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
will be difficult.

2080
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Of course, what you said

2081
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
is exactly right.

2082
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It is really like this.

2083
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
In fact, someone criticized

2084
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
this kind of explanation.

2085
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It is about

2086
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
covering

2087
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
the eyes.

2088
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
In fact, it is possible that

2089
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
this kind of mask was not done well

2090
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
at the beginning,

2091
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
so the final result

2092
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
is not so comprehensive.

2093
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yes.

2094
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
This is possible.

2095
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I think this question is super good.

2096
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
OK.

2097
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It feels like

2098
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
there are no new questions

2099
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
in the chat room.

2100
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Then

2101
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
let's thank

2102
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
YuNan again

2103
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
for his speech today.

2104
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Thank you, everyone.

2105
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
How do I stop?

2106
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Let me clap my hands.

2107
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Thank you.

2108
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Thank you for your support.

2109
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
How many people are there today?

2110
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I can't count.

2111
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Today, I see

2112
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the highest number of people

2113
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
is 32.

2114
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's a lot.

2115
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I found a lot of people.

2116
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Is it related to the field?

2117
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But no one helped me

2118
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to post on Facebook.

2119
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I'm kidding.

2120
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
For example,

2121
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I have given a speech before.

2122
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I am a physics major.

2123
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
There are five people in total.

2124
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Maybe

2125
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
everyone is curious about this.

2126
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I don't know how to start.

2127
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't know either.

2128
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But I'm glad to have this opportunity

2129
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
to share my knowledge.

2130
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Otherwise, I have to contribute

2131
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to the social resources.

2132
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Social resources.

2133
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Are you Gao Hong-An?

2134
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
No, I'm not.

2135
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm not from Taiwan.

2136
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's okay.

2137
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Okay.

2138
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Thank you.

2139
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I have a question.

2140
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I suddenly want to ask you a question.

2141
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
For example,

2142
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
in your first video,

2143
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
This one?

2144
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yes, that one.

2145
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
The one about the matrix.

2146
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
This one?

2147
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yes, this one.

2148
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Do you automatically ignore

2149
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
all the x1, x1, x2, x2

2150
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
in the matrix?

2151
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
We don't discuss

2152
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
our relationship with ourselves.

2153
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
We don't discuss our relationship with ourselves.

2154
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We don't discuss our relationship with ourselves.

2155
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
There is no meaning

2156
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
in the definition of this question.

2157
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yes, because ShopEvalue

2158
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
is still ourselves.

2159
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yes.

2160
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Our group is still ourselves.

2161
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So we don't discuss it.

2162
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Of course, our relationship with ourselves

2163
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
is highly related.

2164
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yes.

2165
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Actually, I don't know

2166
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
how to share it.

2167
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Okay.

2168
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Let me think about it.

2169
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I might stop recording now.

2170
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Okay.
