14000	32000	Today's speaker is Cai Wei, whose theme is Process Optimization and Economic Assessment for Reducing Carbon Emissions by Converting CO2 to Dimethyl Ether with Renewable Hydrogen.
32000	44000	Cai Wei is a Ph.D. student majoring in chemical engineering at NTU. He began his research on carbon dioxide when he was in his junior year of chemical engineering at NTU.
44000	50000	At the time, his main research was on how to capture carbon dioxide from a power plant to gas.
50000	58000	After graduating, he worked in the industry for a few years before joining NTU's Ph.D. program in chemical engineering.
58000	67000	He majored in program system engineering, chemical engineering, program design, and program optimization.
67000	72000	Cai Wei furthered his research at NTU's Ph.D. program.
72000	83000	At NTU, he mainly studied how to convert carbon dioxide into a high-quality chemical product or fuel.
83000	89000	After graduating from NTU's Ph.D. program, he worked as a chemical engineering design engineer.
89000	94000	He learned the difference between academic papers and practical applications.
94000	99000	He hopes that his research can consider more practical applications.
99000	107000	His research usually includes the economic assessment of the process and the practical aspects of process control design.
