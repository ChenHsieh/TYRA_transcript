00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, I am Jason, and I am the host of Taira Talk. Welcome everyone to Taira Talk on April 19th.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
The speaker we invited today is Dr. Zhan Yaojia.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
He is currently a PhD candidate at UC Irvine.

00:26.000 --> 00:39.000
His main work is in telecommunications and network information information theory.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
He used to study and work at NTU Electronics and Telecommunications.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
He is now a PhD student at UC Irvine, and will study abroad under the auspices of the Ministry of Education.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The topic of his talk today is

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
The impact of information technology on wireless network transmission.

01:12.000 --> 01:25.000
Let's give the speaker a round of applause.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Let's give the floor to Yaojia.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Can you hear me?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Yes.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Okay, let's get started.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
In fact, this is channel information.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Channel information refers to wireless transmission.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
If I know in advance that the transmission is good or bad,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
or if I can even quantify it,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I can make some configurations in advance in the transmission section.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
This will further improve the efficiency of my transmission.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
But if today's information is not so accurate,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
what impact will it have on my transmission efficiency?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I hope I can get to this point.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I know some people today,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
and they may all have a background in telecommunications.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
But most of them are not our peers,

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
so I'll see how much I can say.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay, good.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Today I will mainly talk about these three parts.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
The first part is that I will first review

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
how we do information transmission

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
when we are in the so-called traffic jam.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Of course, we have some basic restrictions.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
For example, I hope that the higher the efficiency of my transmission,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
the faster the speed,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
but at the same time I can't let the transmission go wrong.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So what should I do?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
In fact, in 1948,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Claude Shannon had already answered this question.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
He had some good results,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
which we will introduce.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
The second part is that I will briefly introduce

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
some simple networks,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
such as broadcast networks,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
such as interference networks,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
and interference channels.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
They have some current solutions

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
for this kind of transmission problem,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
and some problems have been solved,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
and some problems have not been solved.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Then, in the absence of a solution,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
how do I deal with it?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
How do I get around with it?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The last part is actually more like my research.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
If today I don't know

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
how these channels and links in the middle

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
are,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
the detailed information

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
will not have any fundamental impact on my transmission.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
That's the first part.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
In fact, basically,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
when we communicate,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
the channels are always noisy,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
they are always affected or interfered with by the transmission.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It's the same with wired communication,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
and it's the same with wireless communication,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
and the environment of wireless communication is more complicated.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Because of the so-called multipath effect,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
the signal is distorted.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
In addition to noise,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
there is also distortion,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
which means that at certain moments,

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
at certain times,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
the intensity of my signal is actually very low.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Let's not discuss this complicated situation today.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Let's continue to discuss the above situation.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
That is, in wired communication,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
the signal is affected by noise.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
When I receive this information,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
it is inevitable that there will be errors,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and the information will be wrongly decrypted.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Common models,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
common models for analysis,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
include...

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Wait a minute.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Common models for analysis,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
there are the following two.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The first one is AWGN channel,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Additive Wide Gaussian Noise channel.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Basically, what it says is that

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I input x1, x2 to xn.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The output I receive is y1, y2 to yn.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
The output is what I send,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
plus a random variable with a common distribution.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
This random variable is a mutation.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But in fact, this problem is still very complicated.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
We have made the problem so simple.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
In fact, it is still very complicated.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
So we will further consider

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
a simpler binary symmetric channel.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It only says that

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
the input today is x1 to xn.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
At the receiving end,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
we receive y1 to yn.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Then we limit x1.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Every x, every y,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
is only 0 or 1.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What about the middle channel?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
How does the middle channel

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
change these x and x?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
For example, after sending in x1,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
suppose it is 0,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
then it has a certain probability

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
that p is converted to 1.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
If it is converted to 1 today,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
then this y1 is 1.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
If it has not changed today,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
then it is still 0.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Now the question is,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
now the question is,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
if I really use this,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
suppose our channel is simplified like this,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
only 0 or 1 can be fed in.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
But there is a certain probability

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
that some input will be flipped,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
will be changed.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
How do I do the transmission?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
How do I do the message transmission?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
One way is

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
to send 0 or 1 directly.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Then I don't do any coding at all.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
In this case,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
the error rate is p.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because it has given another x1,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
its probability of being flipped is p.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So the error rate is p.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Is there a better way?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Of course there is.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
We do some basic protection devices,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
protection architecture.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
For example, when I want to send 0,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I send it three times.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
When I want to send 1,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I send it three times.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
When I receive it,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
we use the so-called multi-digit method.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The basic high-speed data can be calculated,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
the error rate will be relatively low.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
It probably looks like this.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
But at the same time,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
in order to send a bit,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I used three channels.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So my data rate,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
that is, the speed of my data transmission

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
will be reduced.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Of course,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
if I increase my repeated times,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
it will definitely reduce my error rate.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
But what is the price?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The price is that my data rate will be reduced.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
And when my channel frequency increases,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
its data rate will drop to 0.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
In fact, this is not the result I want.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Because in order to protect it,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I send it so many times.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
As a result, my data rate became low.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Then my question is,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
is it possible to maintain the data rate at the same time?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
For example, the data rate is not 0.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Reduce the error rate?

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Then, this is a disaster question.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
This is a problem that everyone can immediately think of.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But the first contribution is that

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I will further analyze this problem.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
The first one is

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
to further disassemble the question itself.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
In the first part,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
we add some conditions.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
The first part is that we do not limit

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
coding or decoding.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
For x,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
I did not do any calculations for x.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
For y,

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I did not do any calculations for y.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
There is no problem with computing complexity.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
No matter if it is NP-complete.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
If I have a super-powerful computer,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
it can be instantly calculated.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Then, we do not limit the usage of channels.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Then,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
further think about data.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
These data bits can actually be borrowed from a table.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
This table is on the right.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
It sends these bits,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
sends these data.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
In fact, what did I send?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Which message did I send?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
From 1 to M.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
So,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
the nature of this problem is to say,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
for example,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I want to send the 10th message.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
How do I design

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
this method of transmission

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
so that it can be correctly resolved

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
at the receiving end?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Then,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
next is the rate.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
The definition of rate,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
as I just said,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
is that

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
in the case of so many channels,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
the usage of n channels,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
how many bits did you send?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
OK, there are M bits here.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
So, in fact,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
you can use log12 as your M to represent it.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
So, there are a total of log12 bits.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
So, you can get a basic,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
this is the basic,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
this is the level that high-level math can get.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
That is, M can actually be written as 2nR square.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
n is the usage of the channel.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Then,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
R is the transmission speed.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Okay,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
so, in fact, we will get used to it in the future.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
We are used to using this 2nR square

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
to represent the number of messages.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Then,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
it also tells you that

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I want to make the error rate as small as possible.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It can only be said that

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
at the receiving end,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
I sent a message

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
at the transmission end.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
At the receiving end,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I will design a decoder.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
The fan of the decoder is to guess.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
So,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
guess which message was sent.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I want to,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
so this error means

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
this is my message.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
For example, if I send the 10th message,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
you may guess the 10,000th message.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
That is, an error has occurred.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Then, we want to make the probability of this event

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
as small as possible.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
But,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I must be,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
for example,

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
the event is set,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
for example,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
10 to the 10th square,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
10 to the 100th square,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
and so on,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
this kind of probability.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
so,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
now,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
these restrictions

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
are converted

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
into a transmission structure like this.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
So,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
there is a message in the lower left corner.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
So many.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Then,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I can,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
for example,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I want to send so many bits.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
In fact,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I am sending a certain message.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Then,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
it actually says,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
OK,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I should pass this message

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
through a certain method.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
For example,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
check the table.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
We build a

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
code book,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
code book.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Each message corresponds

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
to a set of code words.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Then,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I use the way of checking the table

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
to make the message

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
into a code word.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Then,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
send it to this channel.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Some bits are crooked.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Then,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
received crooked.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Some of the crooked bits

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
may be flipped.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Then,

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
we use the decoder.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
When the decoder is set,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I know,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
everyone knows what the code book looks like.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Then,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
we can decode

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
the message

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
we really want.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
OK,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
so,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
now the question becomes,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
can we design

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
such a coding scheme?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
What is the coding scheme?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
It is the code mode.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Code structure.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
What is the code structure?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
It includes

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
the code book.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The encoder is the same as the book.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It is just a table.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
And,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
my decoder,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
my decoder,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
my code book requires

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
whether it can

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
be its

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
code rate,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
its transmission speed,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
whether it is

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
not zero,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
or not a very small value.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
And,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
my decoding error,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
it can be controlled

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
at a very small value.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
OK,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
so,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
this is,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
so,

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
now,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
we have formulated

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
the problem structure

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
like this.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
We have

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
the encoder,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
the decoder.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Then,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
our goal is to

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
pass this message

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
to the other end.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Then,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
here,

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I want this mhat,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
that is,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
that is,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
the received end

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
guess the m,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
guess the message,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
the less chance of error,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
the better.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Or,

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
it is in a certain,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
the chance of error

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
is in a certain value

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
below,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
OK.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Then,

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
this answer,

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I can,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
so,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I just,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I have already exploded,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
that is,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
that is,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
this is actually possible,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
can be done.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Otherwise,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I can't go on,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
right?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I can't go on.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Then,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
it is,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
then,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
it is with,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
then,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
this is Shannon's

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
contribution

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
in 1948,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
which is

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
one of his most

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
famous contributions.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Then,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
then,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
he,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
he,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
he made

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
a set of

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
coding schemes

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
including what codebook

13:55.000 --> 13:55.600
plus the

13:55.600 --> 13:56.600
processor.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.600
And then,

13:57.600 --> 13:58.600
but this m maybe

13:58.600 --> 13:59.600
big

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
let my error rate,

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
that is my

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
effect,

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
that is,

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
the error can be

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
pulled to what I want

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
that,

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
that is,

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
the level of

14:08.600 --> 14:09.600
minus 100

14:09.600 --> 14:10.600
quadrature.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
But,

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
if you are

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
uh,

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
if you shoot

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
too quickly

14:15.600 --> 14:16.600
that legendary speed

14:16.600 --> 14:17.600
today,

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
too fast,

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
too high,

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
that

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
problem came.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
If you

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
today,

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
then

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
uh,

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
the problem

14:26.600 --> 14:27.600
on the project

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
came,

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
because

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
there may

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
be

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
you for all

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
N,

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
for all

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
uh,

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
no matter

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
you look for

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
all possible

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
ways,

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
you can't

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
let my

14:41.600 --> 14:42.600
error rate

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
be able to

14:43.600 --> 14:44.600
drop to

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
the level

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
you want

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.600
For example,

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
if you

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
start to

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
drop to

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
10-100

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
quadrature,

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
10-6

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
quadrature,

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
10-7

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
quadrature,

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
you will find

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
that

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
you can't

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
find it,

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
no matter

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
how much

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
you use,

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
you can't

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
find this

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
coding

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
method.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
OK,

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
so this is

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
that,

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
this is called

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Noisy Channel

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
Coding Theorem,

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
and then

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
we put this

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
in our

15:17.600 --> 15:18.600
code,

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
and then

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
there are

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
any questions

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
you can

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
ask,

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
because

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
in fact,

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
I should be,

15:26.600 --> 15:27.600
yes,

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
it should be

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
like the

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
host said,

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
it's really

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
quite mathematical

15:32.600 --> 15:33.600
here,

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
and then

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
uh,

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
I used to

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
do is

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
more engineering

15:38.600 --> 15:39.600
problems,

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
and then

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
turn to

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
more theoretical

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
problems,

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
in fact,

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
it was a

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
long time

15:46.600 --> 15:47.600
ago,

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
so it's

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
completely different,

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
it takes some

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
time to

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
switch,

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
OK,

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
so here

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
is a magical

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
number,

15:56.600 --> 15:57.600
which is

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
called

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
Channel Capacity,

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
and then

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
it is

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
like this,

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
this thing,

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
what is

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
this thing?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.600
This thing

16:06.600 --> 16:07.600
actually,

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
uh,

16:08.600 --> 16:09.600
there is also

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
a mathematical

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
definition,

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
it is,

16:12.600 --> 16:13.600
uh,

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
seems to be

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
very complicated,

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
which is

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
the so-called

16:17.600 --> 16:18.600
Entropy,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
if you are

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
reading physics,

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
you will know

16:21.600 --> 16:22.600
what is called

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
Entropy,

16:23.600 --> 16:24.600
if you are reading

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
chemistry,

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
you know

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
what is

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
Entropy,

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
it basically

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
measures

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
how messy

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
a system

16:32.600 --> 16:33.600
is,

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
but the

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
Entropy here

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
is not the

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
same as

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
that side,

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
the Entropy

16:39.600 --> 16:40.600
definition here

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
is that

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
oh,

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
if today,

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
in fact,

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
the probability

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
is so much,

16:46.600 --> 16:47.600
p of x,

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
uh,

16:48.600 --> 16:49.600
px of e,

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
then multiply by log,

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
there is also

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
uh,

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
p of x,

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
uh,

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
p of x,

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
1,

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
1,

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
so much,

16:58.600 --> 16:59.600
and then

16:59.600 --> 17:00.600
zero,

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
zero in,

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
the calculated value

17:02.600 --> 17:03.600
is the Entropy

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
of x,

17:04.600 --> 17:05.600
the Entropy

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
of random variables

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
of x.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
Okay,

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
so what it means

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
is actually

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
the uncertainty

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
of x,

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
and then

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
the uncertainty

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
of random variables

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
of x.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
Before you do the experiment,

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
you don't know

17:18.600 --> 17:19.600
how much it is,

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
but after you do the experiment,

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
OK,

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
how many bits

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
do you need

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
to represent

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
the result of the experiment?

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
OK,

17:26.600 --> 17:27.600
that is to say,

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
uh,

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
how many,

17:29.600 --> 17:30.600
it means that

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
you have,

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
uh,

17:32.600 --> 17:33.600
you have,

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
uh,

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
yeah,

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
that's about it,

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
and then

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
it's actually

17:38.600 --> 17:39.600
listed on the

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
internet,

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
it's

17:41.600 --> 17:42.600
19 equations

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
for

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
the

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
Entropy

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
of information.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
OK,

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
so we have this thing,

17:48.600 --> 17:49.600
we have this,

17:49.600 --> 17:50.600
after its interpretation,

17:50.600 --> 17:51.600
the Entropy

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
is,

17:52.600 --> 17:53.600
uh,

17:53.600 --> 17:54.600
the uncertainty

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
of x,

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
in terms of bits,

17:56.600 --> 17:57.600
or we need to know

17:57.600 --> 17:58.600
the number of x,

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
we need to know

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
the number of bits.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
So,

18:01.600 --> 18:02.600
let's see

18:02.600 --> 18:03.600
what this thing is,

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
I of x,

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
divided by y,

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
it,

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
uh,

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
its name is

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Mutual Information.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
It,

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
from the second

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
interpretation,

18:12.600 --> 18:13.600
we can see that

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
it's actually

18:14.600 --> 18:15.600
the uncertainty of x

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
divided by,

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
after giving y,

18:17.600 --> 18:18.600
how much uncertainty

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
does x have left?

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
OK,

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
so what does it mean?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
It's actually,

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
if you know,

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
uh,

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
in the case of y,

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
uh,

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
you know in the case of y,

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
how many bits

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
do you actually have,

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
uh,

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
you,

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
you can know

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
how many bits x is.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
So,

18:34.600 --> 18:35.600
to a certain extent,

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
this is actually

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
what we want,

18:37.600 --> 18:38.600
in terms of intuitive meaning,

18:38.600 --> 18:39.600
it's actually,

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
uh,

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
how many bits x is.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.600
So,

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
what Mutual Information

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
actually gives me is,

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
uh,

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
x is,

18:47.600 --> 18:48.600
uh,

18:48.600 --> 18:49.600
in the case of giving y,

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
I know

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
how many things x has.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
I know x's,

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
what x's value is,

18:54.600 --> 18:55.600
in terms of bits,

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
like this.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
OK,

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
so,

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
uh,

18:59.600 --> 19:00.600
so intuitively speaking,

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
this seems to be

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
what we want,

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
but

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
in fact,

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
this proof is

19:05.600 --> 19:06.600
very,

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
very difficult.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
And then,

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
because of this proof,

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
there's a new field called

19:10.600 --> 19:11.600
telecommunications,

19:11.600 --> 19:12.600
telecommunications engineering,

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
there's a new field called

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600
news theory.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
So,

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
so this proof,

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
in fact,

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
in our field,

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
the proof is divided into two parts.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.600
The first part is the so-called

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
converse part.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
It proves that,

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
OK,

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
my code,

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
my transmission speed is greater than c,

19:25.600 --> 19:26.600
it's impossible.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.600
The second part is the

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
achievability part,

19:28.600 --> 19:29.600
which is

19:29.600 --> 19:30.600
achievability is

19:30.600 --> 19:31.600
achievable,

19:31.600 --> 19:32.600
achievable,

19:32.600 --> 19:33.600
that kind of part.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.600
So,

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
it only says,

19:35.600 --> 19:36.600
uh,

19:36.600 --> 19:37.600
I,

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
I actually have to find a

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
way to make

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
this code

19:40.600 --> 19:41.600
pass,

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:42.600 --> 19:43.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
OK.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
pass with such a high speed,

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
OK.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
OK.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.600
Of course,

19:51.600 --> 19:52.600
in the process of passing,

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
we have to,

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
uh,

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
we,

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
but we have to specify my

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
error rate first,

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
for example,

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
10 to the minus 100 times,

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
and then,

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
we have to find

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
such a coding scheme,

20:02.600 --> 20:03.600
and then,

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
and then,

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
of course,

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
nk is any nk,

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
it may take

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
a while,

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
OK.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.600
OK,

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
then,

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
sorry,

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
can I ask a question?

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
Yes, please.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.600
This is,

20:15.600 --> 20:16.600
uh,

20:16.600 --> 20:17.600
because I don't understand

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
it at all,

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
so,

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
uh,

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
this is,

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
I want,

20:22.600 --> 20:23.600
can you give an example?

20:23.600 --> 20:24.600
For example,

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
suppose I know,

20:25.600 --> 20:26.600
suppose I have a

20:26.600 --> 20:27.600
method of passing,

20:27.600 --> 20:28.600
then,

20:28.600 --> 20:29.600
I,

20:29.600 --> 20:30.600
I,

20:30.600 --> 20:31.600
after I get y,

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
I'm totally sure

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
how much x is,

20:33.600 --> 20:34.600
then,

20:34.600 --> 20:35.600
what would i be?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
Would i be 0?

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
OK,

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
if you know,

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
for example,

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
like this,

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
uh,

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
uh,

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
if you say you know,

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
after you get x,

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
you totally know

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
how much x is,

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
right?

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
So,

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
my question is,

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
you have an ideal channel,

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
yes,

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
no noise at all,

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
yes,

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
then,

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
after you get y,

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
you totally know

20:56.600 --> 20:57.600
how much x is,

20:57.600 --> 20:58.600
yes,

20:58.600 --> 20:59.600
yes,

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
then,

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
in the following,

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
probability should be 0,

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
right?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.600
No,

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600
no,

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600
so,

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
the x itself,

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
the x itself,

21:08.600 --> 21:09.600
it's,

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
OK,

21:10.600 --> 21:11.600
it means,

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
if you use this way,

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
I can,

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
I can answer you like this,

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
like,

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
if you know y,

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
then,

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
you know x,

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
then,

21:19.600 --> 21:20.600
suppose it's a channel

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
with no noise,

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
x is actually,

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
you know y,

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
you know x,

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
so,

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
you know the uncertainty of x,

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
after you know y,

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
the uncertainty of x is 0,

21:28.600 --> 21:29.600
so,

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
this one is 0,

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
so,

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
this mutual information,

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
mutual information

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
is equal to

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
x's,

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
like,

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
you can think about

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
how many bits x has,

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
for example,

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
if you use this formula

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
to measure,

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
for example,

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
the way you code is

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
using,

21:44.600 --> 21:45.600
for example,

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
50% chance is 1,

21:46.600 --> 21:47.600
50% chance is 0,

21:47.600 --> 21:48.600
then,

21:48.600 --> 21:49.600
in this way,

21:49.600 --> 21:50.600
if you can,

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
you put this,

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
this,

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
for example,

21:53.600 --> 21:54.600
you take this data

21:54.600 --> 21:55.600
to calculate

21:55.600 --> 21:56.600
h of x,

21:56.600 --> 21:57.600
the answer will be 1,

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
OK,

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
what does it mean?

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
What does it mean?

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
So,

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
p is 1 in 2,

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
right?

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
p is 1,

22:04.600 --> 22:05.600
right?

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
OK,

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
2 is 1,

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
then,

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
log is 1 in 2,

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
1 in 1 in 2 is 1,

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
this value is 1,

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
so,

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
there are two 1 in 2,

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
right?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
OK,

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
so,

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
adding up is 1,

22:17.600 --> 22:18.600
OK,

22:18.600 --> 22:19.600
so,

22:19.600 --> 22:20.600
this value,

22:20.600 --> 22:21.600
i,

22:21.600 --> 22:22.600
this mutual information,

22:22.600 --> 22:23.600
mutual information is 1,

22:23.600 --> 22:24.600
what does it mean?

22:24.600 --> 22:25.600
It means that

22:25.600 --> 22:26.600
my transmission speed

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
can be 1,

22:27.600 --> 22:28.600
1 bit per channel use,

22:28.600 --> 22:29.600
OK,

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
so,

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
channel capacity will be 1,

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
right,

22:32.600 --> 22:33.600
OK,

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
right,

22:34.600 --> 22:35.600
and you can easily

22:35.600 --> 22:36.600
prove this thing,

22:36.600 --> 22:37.600
why?

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
Because the channel is noise,

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
so,

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
no matter what you send,

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
it will receive,

22:41.600 --> 22:42.600
it should be said that

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
what I received

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
is exactly the same as what I send,

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
right?

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
Then it means that

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
there is no channel,

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
I will directly go to

22:48.600 --> 22:49.600
take my,

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
I know this,

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
OK,

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
this base case,

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
I understand now,

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
OK,

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
right,

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
OK,

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
then,

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
I should give a,

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
I actually wrote an example

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
in my lecture,

23:00.600 --> 23:01.600
but I forgot to say,

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
I want to clarify,

23:02.600 --> 23:03.600
that is,

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
that is,

23:04.600 --> 23:05.600
the example just now

23:05.600 --> 23:06.600
is not to say,

23:06.600 --> 23:07.600
how to say,

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
in the case of noiseless,

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
mutual information

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
is always 1,

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
the example just now

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
is 1,

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
OK,

23:13.600 --> 23:14.600
this is related to

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
your encoding method,

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
right?

23:16.600 --> 23:17.600
Right,

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
OK,

23:18.600 --> 23:19.600
OK,

23:19.600 --> 23:20.600
so,

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
in my X,

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
for example,

23:22.600 --> 23:23.600
if today

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
my X

23:24.600 --> 23:25.600
is 10%,

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
for example,

23:26.600 --> 23:27.600
like,

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
another example,

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
suppose my X,

23:29.600 --> 23:30.600
encoding method

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
100% is 1,

23:31.600 --> 23:32.600
0% is

23:32.600 --> 23:33.600
0,

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
that means

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
everything I send

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
is all 1,

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
right?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
Right,

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
right,

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
that's right,

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
right,

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
this is another extreme example,

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
then,

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
in this case,

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
you can figure out that

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
entropy is actually 0,

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
right,

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
because 1 times

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
so you didn't

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
send any information

23:50.600 --> 23:51.600
out,

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
right,

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
that's right,

23:53.600 --> 23:54.600
then this

23:54.600 --> 23:55.600
is 0,

23:55.600 --> 23:56.600
so,

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
so that means,

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
OK,

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
you want to

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
say,

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
OK,

24:01.600 --> 24:02.600
OK,

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
OK,

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
OK,

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
OK,

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
OK,

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
OK,

24:07.600 --> 24:08.600
OK,

24:08.600 --> 24:09.600
OK,

24:09.600 --> 24:10.600
OK,

24:10.600 --> 24:11.600
OK,

24:11.600 --> 24:12.600
OK,

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
OK,

24:13.600 --> 24:14.600
OK,

24:14.600 --> 24:15.600
OK,

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
OK,

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
OK,

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
OK,

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
OK,

24:19.600 --> 24:20.600
so,

24:20.600 --> 24:21.600
the next thing

24:21.600 --> 24:22.600
we have to ask is,

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
how do I

24:23.600 --> 24:24.600
get to this thing?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
Because I'm

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
always at this thing,

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
actually,

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
because,

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
how do I get to this thing?

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
He said,

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
I can use

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
such a fast speed

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
to code,

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
to pass information.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
So,

24:35.600 --> 24:36.600
how do I actually do this thing?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.600
So,

24:37.600 --> 24:38.600
I'm trying to use

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
some examples

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
to talk about this.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
Because his,

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
let's see,

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
let's see if

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
I can finish

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
in a short time,

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
to make it clear,

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
like this.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
OK,

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
so,

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
what is the current goal?

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
I'm going to find a codebook.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
And then,

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
his,

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
his,

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
his,

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
the speed of coding

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
is,

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
or his speed of transmission

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
is very close to

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
his dc.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
And then,

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
there is a decoder.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
He is a decoder.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
OK,

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
so he's looking for these two things.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
Let's assume

25:06.600 --> 25:07.600
my input is,

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
this is 0,

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
input,

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
x,

25:10.600 --> 25:11.600
x1 is

25:11.600 --> 25:12.600
0.5 when it is equal to 1,

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
0.5 when it is equal to 0.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
And then,

25:14.600 --> 25:15.600
the channel,

25:15.600 --> 25:16.600
this channel,

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
the probability of flipping is 0.1.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
That is,

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
if I enter 0 here,

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
10% of the probability

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
will be turned into 1,

25:21.600 --> 25:22.600
90% of the probability,

25:22.600 --> 25:23.600
90% of the probability

25:23.600 --> 25:24.600
will still remain the same,

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
like this.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
OK,

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
OK,

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
OK,

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
so,

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
in fact,

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
how do they think about this problem?

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
He actually wants to say,

25:32.600 --> 25:33.600
OK,

25:33.600 --> 25:34.600
then I just randomly generate

25:34.600 --> 25:35.600
that,

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
I have a random number generator,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
I just randomly generate

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
0 and 1,

25:38.600 --> 25:39.600
a total of n.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.600
Then,

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
I use this,

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
these points mean that

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
there is a set of results.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
Then,

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
I use this big circle

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
to represent

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
all possible situations.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
So,

25:48.600 --> 25:49.600
these points

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
are actually

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
just a few,

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
just a few examples.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
OK,

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
according to the rule of large numbers,

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
I use

25:55.600 --> 25:56.600
the probability

25:56.600 --> 25:57.600
XR,

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
its probability of

25:58.600 --> 25:59.600
1 is 0.5,

25:59.600 --> 26:00.600
the probability of 0

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
is also 0.5.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
So,

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
what does it mean?

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
I can find some,

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
OK,

26:05.600 --> 26:06.600
I can find some,

26:06.600 --> 26:07.600
for example,

26:07.600 --> 26:08.600
this red dot,

26:08.600 --> 26:09.600
I can find some codes,

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
it is about 50%

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
of the composition,

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
about half is 1,

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
half is,

26:13.600 --> 26:14.600
the other half is 0,

26:14.600 --> 26:15.600
like the red code

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
is like this.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.600
The green code is also like this,

26:17.600 --> 26:18.600
that is,

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
the front half is 1,

26:19.600 --> 26:20.600
the back half is 0,

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
like this green one

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
is the same,

26:22.600 --> 26:23.600
the front half is 0,

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
the back half is 1,

26:24.600 --> 26:25.600
OK,

26:25.600 --> 26:26.600
the rule of large numbers

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
tells us that

26:27.600 --> 26:29.600
I randomly generate

26:29.600 --> 26:32.600
a set of code words,

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
it will fall into

26:33.600 --> 26:35.600
this blue set,

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
we call this

26:36.600 --> 26:37.600
typical set,

26:37.600 --> 26:38.600
it will fall into this set,

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
the probability of it is 1.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
Why?

26:40.600 --> 26:41.600
For example,

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
like this,

26:42.600 --> 26:43.600
for example,

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
like this,

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
all of them are

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
1.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
OK,

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
if today,

26:48.600 --> 26:49.600
although,

26:49.600 --> 26:50.600
all of them are 1.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
OK,

26:51.600 --> 26:52.600
then,

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
this situation

26:53.600 --> 26:54.600
is very unlikely to happen,

26:54.600 --> 26:55.600
right?

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
Right?

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
According to the rule of large numbers,

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
it,

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
you have to generate all of it,

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
you have to throw the copper plate,

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
throw it 10,000 times in a row,

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
it's all positive,

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
basically 0.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.600
If all of them

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
are all 0,

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
there is a chance of the opposite,

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
it's all close to 0.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
So,

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
only in,

27:12.600 --> 27:13.600
so,

27:13.600 --> 27:14.600
this thing

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
will not fall into

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
this blue area,

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
this blue area

27:17.600 --> 27:18.600
is the collection of all

27:18.600 --> 27:19.600
that,

27:19.600 --> 27:20.600
54% is 1,

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
54% is 0,

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
all the sequences,

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
all of that,

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
the code word,

27:24.600 --> 27:25.600
like this.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.600
OK,

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
if I choose a red code word today,

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
and then take it,

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
let it pass,

27:29.600 --> 27:30.600
what will happen to me?

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
What is this channel

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
actually doing?

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Is to take these

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
101010,

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
and then,

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
I go,

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
when passing through the channel,

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
these 10 will be

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
the most random flip,

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
some may not change,

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
some may flip.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
That,

27:43.600 --> 27:44.600
there is about 10%,

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
about 10% of the,

27:45.600 --> 27:47.600
10% of the bit

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
may be flipped,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
90% of the chance will not,

27:50.600 --> 27:51.600
90% of the bit

27:51.600 --> 27:52.600
will not be flipped,

27:52.600 --> 27:53.600
because this is

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
a channel feature.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.600
OK,

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
what does it mean

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
in math?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
In fact,

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
I am the original thing,

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
plus a sequence,

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
that is,

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
I just add

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
component y,

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
and then,

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
what is this zn?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
This zn is actually

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
10% is 1,

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
90% is 0.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
OK,

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
and then,

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
that,

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
that is also very likely,

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
that is also,

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
according to the rule of thumb,

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
this is also very likely,

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
this is very likely

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
to happen,

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
and the probability of happening

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
is very close to 1.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
OK,

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
what will happen?

28:21.600 --> 28:22.600
What will happen?

28:22.600 --> 28:23.600
It will be found that

28:23.600 --> 28:24.600
my red,

28:24.600 --> 28:25.600
after going through

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
my own disturbance,

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
it may be

28:27.600 --> 28:28.600
this red,

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
in the small circle,

28:29.600 --> 28:31.600
any of the red points.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
OK,

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
then we put

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
this kind of thing,

28:34.600 --> 28:35.600
every point is actually

28:35.600 --> 28:36.600
a sequence,

28:36.600 --> 28:37.600
n,

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
the length is n sequence,

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600
0, 1 sequence.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
That,

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
specifically,

28:41.600 --> 28:42.600
which,

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
which is flipped,

28:43.600 --> 28:44.600
in fact,

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
we do not know,

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
we put it all

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
in here.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.600
That,

28:48.600 --> 28:49.600
I pass

28:49.600 --> 28:50.600
101010

28:50.600 --> 28:51.600
the situation,

28:51.600 --> 28:53.600
I received the y,

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
uh,

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
what is it,

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
like this,

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
and then,

28:57.600 --> 28:58.600
what is it,

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
it is 101010

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
plus that,

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
all possible,

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
all,

29:02.600 --> 29:03.600
uh,

29:03.600 --> 29:04.600
the probability of occurrence is very high,

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
the result of the disturbance,

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
for example,

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
there are

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
the first 10% is 1,

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
the rest is 0,

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
then we put it

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
in this,

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
this collection.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
Then,

29:13.600 --> 29:14.600
this,

29:14.600 --> 29:15.600
then,

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
this red dot is,

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
for example,

29:17.600 --> 29:18.600
101010

29:18.600 --> 29:19.600
plus,

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
the first 10% is 1,

29:20.600 --> 29:21.600
the rest is 0,

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
the result,

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
like this.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.600
OK,

29:24.600 --> 29:25.600
the same,

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
the same thing,

29:26.600 --> 29:27.600
that,

29:27.600 --> 29:28.600
these things are all very likely to happen,

29:28.600 --> 29:29.600
because according to the law of magnitude,

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
that,

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
the same truth,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
we can,

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
what,

29:33.600 --> 29:34.600
we can,

29:34.600 --> 29:35.600
uh,

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
we can see that,

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
OK,

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
in fact,

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
uh,

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
you just said that the small circle,

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
in fact,

29:41.600 --> 29:42.600
in the red circle,

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
the red circle,

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
it itself also has that,

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
that,

29:45.600 --> 29:46.600
it itself is channel output,

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
that is,

29:47.600 --> 29:48.600
its so-called typical set.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
We can figure out that,

29:49.600 --> 29:50.600
OK,

29:50.600 --> 29:51.600
Y actually has 51%,

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
50% is 0,

29:52.600 --> 29:53.600
then we collect those,

29:53.600 --> 29:54.600
half is 1,

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
half is 0,

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
those sequences,

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
we collect them in here.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
Then,

29:58.600 --> 29:59.600
we put these green dots,

29:59.600 --> 30:00.600
this green dot,

30:00.600 --> 30:01.600
this green dot,

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
this green dot,

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
this green dot,

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
these four green dots,

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
through this way of passing,

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
we can receive these,

30:06.600 --> 30:07.600
uh,

30:07.600 --> 30:08.600
for example,

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
the green dot on the far left,

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
what it receives is,

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
it may be,

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
this green small circle inside,

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
the top one,

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
what it receives is this,

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
the right one,

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
the bottom one,

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
is the one at the bottom.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
OK.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Good.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.600
Then,

30:20.600 --> 30:21.600
I'm going to design this decoder.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
Of course,

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
you can observe that,

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
if the dots I choose today,

30:24.600 --> 30:25.600
are very few,

30:25.600 --> 30:26.600
for example,

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
I only choose these five dots,

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
then in fact,

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
after it is printed,

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
I see on the Y,

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
I see on the Y,

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
that they may not

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
overlap,

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
that they may not overlap,

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
they are all independent,

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
they are all disjoint.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.600
they are all independent,

30:37.600 --> 30:38.600
they are all disjoint.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.600
So,

30:39.600 --> 30:40.600
what does it mean?

30:40.600 --> 30:41.600
As long as its red dot

30:41.600 --> 30:42.600
appears in the red area,

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
appears in the red area,

30:43.600 --> 30:44.600
we can see that

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
Ah,

30:45.600 --> 30:47.600
it wears this.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.600
The green on the left,

30:49.600 --> 30:50.600
if it's sent here,

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
the green on the left,

30:51.600 --> 30:54.600
We tell directly that

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
it wears this?

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
OK.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
Therefore,

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
we can design the decoder.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
Then,

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
I am going to see

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
I am going to design the decoder.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Then,

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
I'm going to see

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
this Y,

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
or the Sequence

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
that is received by me

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
or security

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
or security

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
into this compound.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
If it's in this set,

31:13.600 --> 31:15.600
if it's in this set,

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
I will decode the Y

31:17.600 --> 31:19.600
into the corresponding X.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.600
into the corresponding X.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
For example,

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
if Y is in red,

31:24.600 --> 31:26.600
I will decode it into red.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
If Y is in the upper left corner,

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
I will decode it into the upper left corner.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.600
I will decode it into the upper left corner.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.600
OK.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.600
OK.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.600
This is the most mathematical part.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
This is the most mathematical part

31:36.600 --> 31:37.600
of the whole decoding.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.600
We can calculate

31:39.600 --> 31:41.600
how many

31:41.600 --> 31:44.600
how many

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
how many

31:46.600 --> 31:47.600
OK.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
I should say like this.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
OK.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
This is the design of the decoder.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
I just said that

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
if they don't overlap

31:53.600 --> 31:54.600
these small groups

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
or circles,

31:56.600 --> 31:57.600
then

31:57.600 --> 31:59.600
I can successfully decode

31:59.600 --> 32:00.600
and there is no error, right?

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
Or the error rate

32:01.600 --> 32:02.600
I can say that

32:02.600 --> 32:03.600
I have no error.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.600
But if today

32:05.600 --> 32:06.600
there is a little

32:06.600 --> 32:07.600
allow a little overlap,

32:07.600 --> 32:08.600
then we can

32:08.600 --> 32:09.600
let the error rate

32:09.600 --> 32:10.600
let the error rate

32:10.600 --> 32:11.600
control the threshold

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
control the threshold

32:13.600 --> 32:14.600
that we want

32:14.600 --> 32:15.600
10 to the negative 6th square

32:15.600 --> 32:16.600
10 to the negative 100th square.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.600
OK.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.600
Today

32:18.600 --> 32:19.600
Now the problem is that

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
OK.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.600
We can't choose too many

32:21.600 --> 32:22.600
OK.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.600
We can't choose too many

32:23.600 --> 32:24.600
these points.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.600
For example, we just chose 5 points.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.600
It has made this

32:26.600 --> 32:27.600
red inside

32:27.600 --> 32:28.600
so many crowded

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
small circles.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
If we choose

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
a few more,

32:31.600 --> 32:32.600
then these small circles

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
will actually overlap.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
As long as there is a large

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
large-scale overlap

32:35.600 --> 32:36.600
large-scale overlap

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
large-scale overlap

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
large-scale overlap

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
the error rate

32:39.600 --> 32:40.600
and the error rate

32:40.600 --> 32:41.600
is still very high.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
OK.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
We try to avoid

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
this situation.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
So how do we see it?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
Let's see

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
OK.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
Let's see

32:48.600 --> 32:49.600
in this blue circle

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
how many

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
how many

32:51.600 --> 32:52.600
how many

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
how many

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
code words are in it.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
Then we put this

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
blue circle

32:56.600 --> 32:57.600
called TX

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
like this.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
OK.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
TX

33:00.600 --> 33:01.600
Then we use a bar

33:01.600 --> 33:02.600
to represent its

33:02.600 --> 33:03.600
absolute value

33:03.600 --> 33:04.600
to represent its number.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
Then you can calculate

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
its number

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
is actually about

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
X

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
is the entropy of X.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Then its detailed introduction

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
is

33:11.600 --> 33:12.600
is actually very simple.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.600
You just think about

33:13.600 --> 33:14.600
how do I

33:14.600 --> 33:15.600
if I randomly generate code words

33:15.600 --> 33:16.600
how do I get

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
the red one?

33:17.600 --> 33:18.600
Then the probability of it being calculated

33:18.600 --> 33:19.600
is about this much.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.600
This is high school math

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
can be calculated.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.600
Then

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
through the conversion of high school math

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
put this

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
TX

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
on the square

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
you can calculate

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
OK.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
It actually draws

33:29.600 --> 33:30.600
a red circle

33:30.600 --> 33:31.600
the probability of a red circle

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
is 2 to the negative n

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
X

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
negative

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
negative

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
negative

33:36.600 --> 33:37.600
OK.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
But

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
the probability of a blue circle

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
is 1.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.600
So

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
if you collect

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
all these points

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
the probability of it being added

33:44.600 --> 33:45.600
will be 1.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.600
So

33:46.600 --> 33:47.600
roughly

33:47.600 --> 33:48.600
in this circle

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
there are so many

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
so many

33:50.600 --> 33:51.600
so many

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
so many

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
so many

33:53.600 --> 33:54.600
so many

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
so many

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
so many

33:56.600 --> 33:57.600
so many

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
so many

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
so many

33:59.600 --> 34:00.600
so many

34:00.600 --> 34:01.600
so many

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
so many

34:02.600 --> 34:03.600
so many

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
so many

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
so many

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
so many

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
so many

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
so many

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
so many

34:09.600 --> 34:10.600
so many

34:10.600 --> 34:11.600
so many

34:11.600 --> 34:12.600
so many

34:12.600 --> 34:13.600
so many

34:13.600 --> 34:14.600
so many

34:14.600 --> 34:15.600
so many

34:15.600 --> 34:16.600
so many

34:16.600 --> 34:17.600
so many

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
so many

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
red circles

34:19.600 --> 34:20.600
OK.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.600
So

34:21.600 --> 34:22.600
now

34:22.600 --> 34:23.600
my goal is

34:23.600 --> 34:24.600
to not to

34:24.600 --> 34:25.600
let these

34:25.600 --> 34:26.600
rising circles overlap

34:26.600 --> 34:27.600
so

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
that

34:28.600 --> 34:29.600
I can

34:29.600 --> 34:31.600
can

34:31.600 --> 34:32.600
can

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
can

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
can

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
let these two

34:35.600 --> 34:36.600
come in

34:36.600 --> 34:37.600
which is

34:37.600 --> 34:38.600
h of

34:38.600 --> 34:39.600
entropy of y

34:39.600 --> 34:40.600
minus entropy of y given x

34:40.600 --> 34:41.600
so

34:41.600 --> 34:42.600
by definition

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
this thing

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
my R

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
is

34:45.600 --> 34:46.600
less than

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
or equal to

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
the mutual information

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
of x and y

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
like this

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
OK.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
Of course we can

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
improve

34:53.600 --> 34:54.600
but it's just

34:54.600 --> 34:55.600
a loose statement

34:55.600 --> 34:56.600
we can

34:56.600 --> 34:57.600
improve

34:57.600 --> 34:58.600
to prove

34:58.600 --> 34:59.600
that

34:59.600 --> 35:00.600
this

35:00.600 --> 35:01.600
this

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
way of

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
decoding

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
can be

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
as small as

35:05.600 --> 35:06.600
we want

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
OK.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.600
OK.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
So

35:09.600 --> 35:10.600
OK.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.600
So

35:11.600 --> 35:12.600
is this

35:12.600 --> 35:13.600
the most mathematical part

35:13.600 --> 35:14.600
of the whole talk

35:14.600 --> 35:15.600
and

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
then

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
then

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
I don't know

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
if there is any

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
question

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
here

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
OK.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
OK.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
OK.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
OK.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.600
OK.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.600
OK.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
OK.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
OK.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
OK.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
OK.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.600
OK.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.600
.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.600
.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.600
.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.600
.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.600
.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.600
.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.600
.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.600
.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.600
.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.600
.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.600
.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.600
.
