0	18000	Welcome to today's TerraTalk. I am the host for today, Zhang Yanyong. Today, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming, a physical psychologist, to introduce his research interests to us.
18000	25000	Today's research topic is the complexity of unconscious processing. What else do we need to be conscious of?
26000	42000	Before starting today's lecture, let me introduce Shaoming first. Shaoming graduated from the Department of Psychology of NTU. After obtaining a degree, he obtained a Doctoral Degree in Neuroscience from Duke University, Singapore National University Medical School.
42000	53000	After obtaining a Doctoral Degree in Singapore National University Medical School, he came to the University of California, L.A. to do post-doctoral research.
53000	64000	For most of his research, he asked the question, what is consciousness? Can we process unconscious information? What is the relationship between attention and consciousness?
65000	81000	In order to answer these questions, he spent a lot of time designing experiments. His research tools include psychological and physical methods, magnetic reflection, and recently he has also started to use a brain map and eye tracking devices.
82000	97000	Before we welcome Dr. Hong Shaoming, I would like to ask everyone to mute their microphones so that our speakers can hear our applause.
97000	101000	Let's give a round of applause to thank Shaoming for bringing us today's lecture.
127000	139000	What do you want to explain behind the experiment? What do you want to explain? I would suggest that you pause between the entire research and let everyone ask questions. You can ask more details, etc.
139000	145000	If there are no questions, let's start.
146000	150000	As Dr. Hong mentioned, today we are going to talk about the complexity of unconscious processing.
151000	156000	In the end, I want to spend a little time to discuss if I can prove that unconscious processing is really very complicated.
157000	167000	What do we want to do with consciousness? Why don't our brains be like a computer? We receive an input, process it, and then throw the output out.
167000	172000	We don't need to be surprised by the outside world. Why do our brains need to be surprised by the outside world?
173000	174000	In the end, there will be a little discussion.
175000	190000	As usual, I usually define what consciousness is before I talk. At least what is consciousness in this framework of discussion?
191000	195000	The consciousness I want to discuss is basically related to the content, not the state.
196000	197000	These two are more common.
198000	201000	The meaning of the content is, for example, if I pick up this cup now, I don't know if you can see me.
202000	208000	Anyway, when I pick up the cup and I am conscious of this cup, it means that this cup has entered my consciousness.
209000	212000	The state is, for example, I am very bored now, and after five minutes you may fall asleep.
213000	216000	After you fall asleep, before you have a dream, you are in an unconscious state.
216000	219000	The state is not what we are going to talk about today.
220000	226000	It's all about the sensory stimulus that didn't enter your consciousness.
227000	230000	The consciousness we are going to talk about today is also focused on visual awareness.
231000	235000	We often talk about visual awareness.
236000	251000	I will mix visual awareness with consciousness.
252000	255000	When I say consciousness, I am basically talking about visual awareness in this talk.
256000	261000	The experiments I will show you later and the research I usually do are mostly focused on the visual level.
261000	267000	It doesn't mean that these things can't be discussed in the sense of hearing or touch.
268000	270000	It's just that today's focus is on visual awareness.
271000	276000	Why am I interested in the study of unconscious processing?
277000	282000	One of the points is that according to the information theory,
283000	289000	they have a little estimate of the amount of information we receive every second of our eyes and the content we can probably realize.
289000	293000	The amount of information that the eyes can receive is about 10 to 80 bits, so it's a lot.
294000	295000	We can receive so much information every second.
296000	298000	But the content of our real consciousness is a bit controversial.
299000	302000	It's about a few dozen to a few hundred, up to a thousand bits per second.
303000	305000	You can see a very, very, very big difference.
306000	308000	Simply put, of course, the message is transmitted.
309000	312000	From the moment your eyes receive the message to the moment you realize it,
313000	315000	a lot of information is lost.
316000	320000	Another possibility is that when we process external information in the brain,
321000	324000	even if we process it, the information has never entered our consciousness.
325000	327000	But it's still processed by our brain, and it might still affect our behavior.
328000	331000	What I'm interested in is what kind of information these messages are.
332000	335000	What kind of unconscious content can the brain process?
336000	339000	What kind of information can affect our behavior after processing?
340000	342000	Today's menu is very simple.
343000	344000	I'm talking about three things.
345000	350000	First, I'm going to talk about some early research.
351000	352000	I'm going to talk about some early research.
353000	357000	I want to convince you that a lot of things we think we've seen,
358000	359000	or we think we've realized,
360000	361000	like the two words I just said, I'm going to mix them up.
362000	364000	We don't actually realize or see these things.
365000	369000	These are classic psychological or intellectual research.
370000	373000	Second, I'm going to talk about my main research.
373000	376000	Do we just ignore the things we don't see?
377000	378000	No.
378000	380000	We found in a lot of research that the information we don't see,
381000	382000	the information we don't realize,
383000	385000	your brain can still process it, and it can further affect your behavior.
386000	389000	Finally, let's spend some time talking about why we need to see,
390000	391000	why we need to be aware of,
392000	393000	why we need to feel the outside world,
394000	395000	why we need to have experience.
396000	398000	You can feel it from the use of label symbols,
399000	400000	from the first to the third,
400000	403000	which is more and more speculative.
404000	406000	The third is basically my own personal guess.
407000	408000	You're welcome to jump in and discuss.
409000	410000	For the preliminary part,
411000	415000	I'm going to spend some time convincing you that a lot of things we think we've seen,
416000	417000	but we haven't.
417000	419000	The first is a very common example.
420000	421000	When we look at a picture,
422000	425000	we intuitively think that our visual system or our eyes
426000	429000	are like a camera or a camera.
430000	431000	We look at all the details.
431000	432000	For example, if you look at this picture now,
432000	433000	you'll see an animal in the middle,
434000	435000	a lot of flowers and grass,
435000	436000	and I've seen a lot of details.
437000	438000	The next thing I'm going to show you
438000	440000	is a bit like what we used to play when we were kids.
441000	442000	It's called...
444000	445000	I kind of forgot what it's called now.
445000	446000	But anyway,
446000	448000	what I'm going to show you is that I'm going to move this picture
449000	450000	to one of the places,
450000	452000	and then I'm going to move this original picture and the changed picture
452000	454000	back and forth.
454000	456000	If you look at this picture now,
456000	458000	you can remember all the details,
458000	460000	or you can capture all the details in your eyes.
460000	461000	Once I move it,
461000	463000	you should be able to see it very clearly.
463000	465000	Let's try to see if you can see it.
465000	466000	At this time,
466000	468000	we're going to use the YES function we just talked about.
468000	470000	There should be a hand symbol on the far left of your screen.
470000	471000	When you see
472000	473000	where these two pictures are different,
473000	475000	please press YES right away to let me know.
475000	476000	Okay, let's get started.
480000	482000	These are two different pictures.
482000	483000	There's one little thing that's different.
484000	485000	We have a person who is very good at it.
485000	486000	I saw it in an instant.
492000	494000	Okay, then...
494000	495000	He pressed NO again later.
495000	498000	So now it looks like everyone hasn't seen it yet.
498000	500000	I'll give you another ten seconds.
500000	501000	Then I'll announce the answer.
503000	504000	Oh, some people saw it.
504000	505000	Great.
507000	508000	Then I'll announce the answer.
508000	509000	The answer is here.
509000	510000	This point is different.
511000	514000	So this is called change blindness.
514000	515000	What does this mean?
515000	518000	When we think our visual system
518000	519000	sees the outside world,
519000	521000	it will actually capture all the details.
521000	522000	It's not.
522000	524000	Your visual system will actually ignore a lot of details.
524000	527000	What we think we see is actually not what we see.
527000	529000	So when I make a little change,
529000	531000	I'll show you what's the difference between the two pictures.
531000	532000	You actually can't find it.
532000	534000	Okay, that's the first example.
534000	535000	The second example,
535000	536000	in fact, it's still the same.
536000	537000	Okay, that's the first example.
537000	538000	The second example,
538000	539000	in fact, it's still change blindness.
539000	540000	I think this example is very cool.
540000	542000	It's a progressive change blindness.
542000	544000	Okay, this is actually a video.
544000	546000	I'll play this video later.
546000	548000	It will change slowly.
548000	550000	It's a dynamic thing.
550000	552000	Once you see any change,
552000	553000	please press YES right away.
553000	555000	Okay, let's get started.
561000	563000	It's actually a constant process of change.
563000	565000	You might think this is a static picture.
565000	567000	No, it's a video.
571000	573000	Do you see any difference?
573000	574000	Because I've seen it many times.
574000	575000	Now I can clearly see that
575000	578000	it's not the same as it was at the beginning.
578000	581000	Okay, I'll give you five more seconds.
581000	582000	Did you see it?
582000	585000	Some people started to see it.
585000	587000	Okay, I'm going to stop here.
587000	590000	Our video has been broadcast here.
590000	593000	This is what the video looks like at the beginning.
593000	595000	And this is what it looked like just now.
595000	597000	You can see that the color is very different.
597000	599000	This is a progressive change blindness.
599000	601000	In fact, this thing is right in front of us.
601000	603000	But such a big color change,
603000	606000	my visual system can't capture it.
606000	608000	Again,
608000	609000	many times we think
609000	611000	we have seen some changes in the outside world.
611000	613000	Or we actually see the outside world very clearly.
613000	617000	In fact, it may not be true.
617000	620000	Let's show you another more famous example.
621000	623000	I want to broadcast the video first.
623000	624000	After the broadcast,
624000	629000	I'll talk about what this phenomenon is.
629000	632000	What you have to do in this video is
632000	633000	to count the people who are wearing white clothes.
633000	635000	Maybe some people have seen it here.
635000	637000	Because this is really very famous.
637000	639000	People who study psychology must have seen it.
639000	641000	Anyway, others, you can try it first.
641000	642000	What you have to do later is
642000	645000	to count the people wearing white clothes.
645000	648000	How many times have they played basketball?
648000	649000	It's that simple.
649000	651000	Let's get started.
679000	689000	I don't know if you have successfully counted 15 times.
689000	692000	Now the key question is
692000	696000	Did you see a big star on the screen just now?
696000	698000	If you see it, please press Yes.
698000	699000	If you don't see it, please press No.
699000	702000	I want to see your answers.
710000	712000	I will continue to broadcast the video.
712000	715000	It seems that half of the people here have seen it.
715000	716000	Half of the people have seen it.
716000	717000	Half of the people have not seen it.
717000	718000	I will continue to broadcast the video.
718000	724000	Let's take a look at what happened in the middle of the video.
724000	727000	What happened in the middle of the video
727000	733000	when you were counting the people wearing white clothes?
734000	740000	This is a classic psychological phenomenon called
740000	743000	Inattentional blindness.
743000	745000	For example, when your attention is focused on
745000	748000	counting the people wearing white clothes,
748000	751000	even if something strange happens in a very close place,
751000	753000	you still can't see it.
753000	757000	You can't bring these things into your consciousness.
757000	759000	This is called Inattentional blindness.
759000	762000	You can't see these things without attention.
763000	765000	This phenomenon is very famous.
765000	769000	This phenomenon is called Invisible Gorilla.
769000	773000	It is a visual stimulus that is very easy to see.
773000	776000	However, under a slightly difficult situation,
776000	779000	this visual stimulus disappears in front of you.
779000	781000	Finally, I want to talk about a more recent experiment.
781000	783000	Although this experiment is very recent,
783000	786000	the questions answered or the questions you want to answer
786000	789000	are related to something that has been discussed for many years
789000	792000	in the field of neuroscience, psychology, and neuroscience.
792000	798000	Is it true that our eyes feel those colors?
798000	800000	Let me put it this way. Is it true?
800000	803000	In physiology, if you know,
803000	806000	the amount of tracking cells around our eyes is
806000	808000	much less compared to our fovea,
808000	811000	which is right in the middle of the eye.
811000	814000	In other words, if you look at it from a physiological point of view,
814000	817000	the things we see around our eyes should not be very saturated.
817000	819000	The color we see should not be very saturated.
819000	821000	It's a little blurry and black.
821000	824000	But subjectively, we don't feel it.
824000	826000	Subjectively, we think,
826000	828000	I also see the color next to it.
828000	829000	For example, there is a lake next to me.
829000	831000	I also see the color of that lake.
831000	833000	Our subjective experience seems to be a little inconsistent
833000	835000	with the evidence in physiology.
835000	836000	In the past few decades,
836000	838000	there have been many experiments that want to explain to everyone that
838000	841000	you feel like you can see the color of your corner of the eye.
841000	843000	In fact, it is not necessary.
843000	846000	This experiment was published two years ago.
846000	848000	Basically, the whole process of the experiment
848000	850000	is very similar to the traditional experiment.
850000	853000	It's just that they used a VR system.
853000	854000	The question they want to ask is,
854000	859000	if you say you can see the colors around your eyes,
859000	863000	why don't I change it secretly?
863000	865000	If you can see those changes,
865000	866000	that means you can really see it.
866000	868000	Because you really read those colors.
868000	869000	If you can't see it,
870000	874000	maybe the colors you see around your eyes and corner of your eyes
874000	876000	are not as rich as you think.
876000	877000	Their method is very simple.
877000	879000	It's a VR, a virtual reality goggle.
879000	880000	After putting on the goggles,
880000	884000	I will ask them to look at a scene.
884000	886000	For example, here is a rural scene.
886000	887000	Some small houses and so on.
887000	889000	They don't have to do anything.
889000	891000	Their job is,
891000	892000	I might give you a few seconds.
892000	895000	You're just looking around.
895000	896000	In the last trial,
896000	899000	they will slowly turn the places
899000	903000	outside your eyes into black and white.
903000	908000	The amount of changes will be from the most difficult to the simplest.
908000	910000	The simplest is 10 degrees.
910000	912000	The most difficult is 32.5 degrees.
912000	914000	32.5 degrees is the center of your eyes.
914000	916000	About 30 centimeters out of your hand,
916000	919000	there is color in the middle circle.
919000	920000	The rest is colorless.
921000	927000	So even the least obvious situation
927000	929000	is obvious to us.
929000	930000	If you imagine that
930000	934000	the 30-centimeter circle in front of you is colored,
934000	935000	and everything else is black,
935000	936000	will you notice it?
936000	937000	People instinctively say yes.
937000	939000	How many people noticed it at this time?
939000	940000	About 20%.
940000	943000	So about 80% of people didn't notice it.
943000	948000	Only the 32.5-degree corner in the middle is colored.
948000	950000	The rest is not colored.
950000	951000	The rest is not colored.
951000	952000	Most people will say,
952000	953000	I didn't see it.
953000	954000	It's the same as before.
954000	955000	There is color.
955000	957000	It's normal.
957000	958000	This once again proves that
958000	960000	what we thought we saw,
960000	962000	for example, in this situation,
962000	965000	is the color of the corner of our eyes.
965000	966000	We really didn't see it.
966000	967000	Because if we didn't see it,
967000	968000	once it's changed,
968000	970000	we should be able to notice the change.
970000	972000	But we can't.
972000	978000	Through these four different demonstrations,
978000	980000	I want to convince you that
980000	981000	in everyday life,
981000	982000	when you open your eyes,
982000	984000	many things you think you've seen,
984000	985000	you've noticed,
985000	988000	are actually not there.
988000	990000	If you are convinced that
990000	992000	many things in the outside world,
992000	993000	for example,
993000	994000	we're talking about the visual world now,
994000	995000	many things in the visual world
995000	998000	haven't really entered our consciousness.
998000	999000	For me,
999000	1001000	the next instinctive question is
1002000	1004000	what happened to the things you didn't see?
1004000	1006000	Have they been processed by our brain?
1006000	1008000	Or did our brain choose to see some things
1008000	1011000	and throw away the rest?
1011000	1014000	This is the main part of today's lecture,
1014000	1016000	which is my own research.
1016000	1017000	Here,
1017000	1020000	I've chosen two studies to discuss with you.
1020000	1023000	The first study is related to the attraction of the face.
1023000	1024000	We want to show that
1024000	1025000	the attraction of the face,
1025000	1028000	even when you don't see that face,
1028000	1029000	can also be extracted.
1029000	1032000	It will affect how you distribute your attention.
1032000	1033000	The second study I want to talk about
1033000	1035000	is a little more complicated,
1035000	1037000	which is the processing of language.
1037000	1038000	I want to show that
1038000	1039000	the processing of language,
1039000	1042000	even when you don't see the key word
1042000	1044000	or some sentences,
1044000	1046000	you can still extract
1046000	1048000	the words you can't see.
1048000	1050000	These grammatical errors
1050000	1052000	will be processed by your brain
1052000	1054000	and further affect your behavior.
1054000	1055000	It's very abstract now,
1055000	1058000	but it will be clearer as time goes on.
1058000	1059000	First, let's talk about
1059000	1063000	the study of the attraction of the face.
1063000	1065000	Why are we interested in this?
1065000	1068000	The study of the attraction of the face
1068000	1070000	has a long history.
1070000	1074000	There are many theories.
1074000	1075000	Objectively,
1075000	1077000	if we don't care about any theory,
1077000	1079000	from the perspective of a normal person,
1079000	1082000	how do we know that a face is beautiful?
1082000	1083000	Objectively,
1083000	1086000	we need a kind of conscious deliberation.
1086000	1088000	In other words,
1088000	1090000	we need to be mindful
1090000	1092000	of every face we see,
1092000	1093000	and then say,
1093000	1094000	I like this face.
1094000	1095000	It's attractive to me.
1095000	1096000	I don't like this face.
1096000	1098000	We need to look at each face,
1098000	1100000	spend some time and effort
1100000	1103000	to judge whether it's beautiful
1103000	1105000	or not.
1105000	1106000	However,
1106000	1108000	this kind of intuitive thinking
1108000	1110000	is contradictory to the results
1110000	1113000	or answers given by traditional psychology.
1113000	1114000	What does this mean?
1114000	1115000	In fact,
1115000	1117000	psychology basically implies
1117000	1119000	a very automatic
1119000	1122000	or even very internal
1122000	1125000	or very small
1125000	1129000	mechanism to deal with the attraction of the face.
1129000	1130000	What does this mean?
1130000	1132000	For example,
1132000	1133000	many studies,
1133000	1135000	including recent or earlier studies,
1135000	1136000	found that
1136000	1139000	a very short presentation time,
1139000	1140000	that is, I show you a face
1140000	1141000	and the time is very, very short,
1141000	1143000	can let you judge
1143000	1144000	whether it's attractive to you or not.
1144000	1145000	We're talking about short,
1145000	1146000	short to, for example,
1146000	1147000	this is 100 milliseconds,
1147000	1148000	that's 0.1 seconds,
1148000	1149000	and there are even some
1149000	1150000	that are short to 13 milliseconds,
1150000	1152000	that's 75 hertz of a computer frame,
1152000	1153000	which is a flash.
1153000	1154000	In fact,
1154000	1155000	in such a short time,
1155000	1156000	the audience can still judge
1156000	1157000	whether this face is beautiful
1157000	1158000	or not for him.
1158000	1160000	This seems to imply that
1160000	1161000	we don't actually need
1161000	1163000	the so-called deliberation,
1163000	1164000	don't have to spend a lot of effort
1164000	1165000	to look at that face,
1165000	1168000	judge whether I like it or not.
1168000	1169000	In addition,
1169000	1171000	earlier baby studies also pointed out that
1171000	1173000	if you show the baby some pictures,
1173000	1174000	pictures of the face,
1174000	1176000	the baby will prefer
1176000	1178000	a face that is more attractive to them.
1178000	1179000	These attractive faces
1179000	1180000	are of course also defined
1180000	1181000	by adults,
1181000	1182000	which is a more beautiful face.
1182000	1183000	Show the baby
1183000	1184000	and find that they will spend more time
1184000	1185000	staring at those
1185000	1187000	more beautiful faces for them.
1187000	1188000	Okay,
1188000	1189000	this implies
1189000	1193000	whether to judge
1193000	1195000	or read something,
1195000	1196000	whether a face is beautiful,
1196000	1198000	is a very early
1198000	1199000	study,
1199000	1201000	or even an early process.
1201000	1202000	Okay,
1202000	1203000	this is basically the basis
1203000	1205000	of our experiment.
1205000	1206000	If there are
1206000	1208000	these past research foundations,
1208000	1210000	then we propose an assumption
1210000	1212000	that perhaps the attractiveness of the face
1212000	1214000	can be read by us
1214000	1216000	when you have not seen the face at all.
1216000	1218000	How do we prove this?
1218000	1220000	Here I have selected a few experiments
1220000	1221000	to explain to you.
1221000	1222000	Okay,
1222000	1223000	this is our assumption.
1223000	1226000	The first question we ask is
1227000	1229000	whether the beautiful face you can't see
1229000	1230000	has some advantages.
1230000	1231000	What does this mean?
1231000	1233000	In fact, if you know a little bit about
1233000	1236000	the psychology of the human face,
1236000	1237000	many studies say
1237000	1238000	that beautiful faces
1238000	1239000	have many advantages.
1239000	1240000	For example,
1240000	1241000	in general,
1241000	1242000	people will spend more time
1242000	1243000	paying attention to these faces,
1243000	1244000	spending more time
1244000	1246000	looking at these faces.
1246000	1247000	What we are actually asking here
1247000	1248000	is something similar.
1248000	1249000	Is it possible that
1249000	1250000	these beautiful faces
1250000	1252000	even if they are hidden by us,
1252000	1253000	I will talk about
1253000	1254000	how we hide them later,
1254000	1257000	it will still show some advantages.
1257000	1258000	The way we ask here is
1258000	1260000	whether these beautiful faces
1260000	1261000	after we hide them,
1261000	1262000	it will still be easier
1262000	1264000	to enter our conscious state.
1264000	1265000	In other words,
1265000	1266000	when in unconscious state,
1266000	1268000	its processing may be more efficient
1268000	1270000	or simply faster.
1270000	1271000	I will explain later
1271000	1272000	what is this
1272000	1274000	intraocular suppression.
1274000	1275000	Let's talk about
1275000	1277000	the general way we use
1277000	1279000	is to find a face database.
1279000	1280000	Here I just want to tell you
1280000	1281000	that the faces we use
1281000	1284000	are all emotionally neutral.
1284000	1285000	They are all faces
1285000	1287000	that the collector has never seen.
1287000	1288000	The important thing here is
1288000	1291000	that these faces are relatively neutral.
1291000	1292000	Some collectors even told me
1292000	1293000	that sometimes our faces
1293000	1294000	look a little scary
1294000	1295000	because I don't want them
1295000	1297000	to have too much emotional information.
1297000	1298000	I don't want emotions
1298000	1299000	to become another factor
1299000	1301000	to affect our experiment results.
1301000	1302000	Another point is
1302000	1304000	in this experiment,
1304000	1306000	we have a main experiment.
1306000	1307000	After the main experiment,
1307000	1309000	we asked him to rate it.
1309000	1310000	Is this face beautiful
1310000	1311000	or not beautiful?
1311000	1312000	So in the main experiment,
1312000	1313000	they don't know
1313000	1315000	they shouldn't consider
1315000	1316000	anything related to
1316000	1317000	facial attractiveness
1317000	1318000	because it has nothing to do
1318000	1319000	with their work.
1319000	1321000	This is actually quite important.
1321000	1322000	Let me explain
1322000	1323000	how we make things
1323000	1325000	invisible in this experiment.
1325000	1326000	How to make things invisible
1326000	1327000	to the collector.
1327000	1328000	Conceptually,
1328000	1329000	he is actually...
1329000	1330000	Please say.
1330000	1332000	Someone is asking a question in the chat.
1332000	1333000	Do you want to answer now
1333000	1335000	or will you leave a time later?
1335000	1336000	I will ask a question
1336000	1337000	at this time.
1337000	1338000	But I can...
1338000	1339000	Wait a minute.
1342000	1344000	This is a real face.
1344000	1347000	This is a Karolinska Face Database.
1347000	1349000	Karolinska is a face
1349000	1351000	made in Sweden.
1351000	1352000	You can see
1352000	1354000	their clothes are the same.
1354000	1357000	No makeup or light makeup.
1362000	1364000	I will continue.
1364000	1365000	I encourage you to...
1365000	1367000	If it's a quick question like this,
1367000	1369000	but if it's a more complicated question,
1369000	1370000	I encourage you to ask
1370000	1373000	between research and research.
1373000	1374000	OK.
1374000	1375000	I want to talk about
1375000	1377000	how we make things invisible.
1377000	1378000	The method we use
1378000	1379000	is a method
1379000	1381000	related to binocular rivalry.
1381000	1382000	What does binocular rivalry
1382000	1385000	or binocular competition mean?
1385000	1387000	When your left eye
1387000	1388000	and right eye
1388000	1390000	show very different images,
1390000	1391000	for example, a human face
1391000	1393000	and a house,
1393000	1394000	or a straight line
1394000	1395000	and a oblique line.
1395000	1396000	Instinctively,
1396000	1397000	we think
1397000	1398000	what we see
1398000	1399000	is a stack of these two things.
1399000	1400000	Maybe a human face
1400000	1401000	and a house.
1401000	1402000	It's not.
1402000	1404000	Our visual system
1404000	1406000	will choose one of them
1406000	1407000	and let you see it.
1407000	1408000	For example, a human face.
1408000	1409000	After a while,
1409000	1411000	you see a house.
1411000	1412000	Then you see a human face
1412000	1413000	and a house.
1413000	1414000	This will continue.
1414000	1415000	In other words,
1415000	1416000	our visual system
1416000	1417000	will choose
1417000	1419000	an image on one eye
1419000	1421000	and show it to you.
1421000	1423000	The image on the other eye
1423000	1424000	is basically suppressed
1424000	1425000	and invisible.
1425000	1427000	This is called binocular rivalry.
1427000	1428000	Your eyes are always
1428000	1429000	in a state of rivalry.
1429000	1430000	You don't usually feel it
1430000	1431000	because what you see
1431000	1432000	is very close.
1432000	1433000	There is a slight difference.
1433000	1434000	But basically
1434000	1435000	they are fused together.
1435000	1437000	So there is no rivalry.
1437000	1438000	But occasionally
1438000	1440000	there can be a rivalry.
1440000	1441000	If you are interested,
1441000	1443000	I can talk about it later.
1443000	1444000	But anyway,
1444000	1445000	when I show you
1445000	1446000	two very different things,
1446000	1447000	there will be
1447000	1448000	a binocular rivalry.
1448000	1449000	In 2005,
1449000	1452000	Nelson and Christophe Koch
1452000	1453000	found that
1453000	1454000	if your two eyes
1454000	1456000	are always in a state of rivalry,
1456000	1457000	what if I make
1457000	1459000	one of your eyes
1459000	1461000	look very strong,
1461000	1463000	very colorful,
1463000	1464000	and keep flickering?
1464000	1465000	Like this.
1465000	1466000	We call these things
1466000	1467000	Mondrian's.
1467000	1468000	This is related to
1468000	1469000	the painting
1469000	1470000	by the Dutch painter.
1470000	1471000	It was brought from there.
1471000	1472000	Mondrian's
1472000	1473000	keeps flickering
1473000	1474000	on one eye.
1474000	1475000	On the other eye,
1475000	1476000	you show it
1476000	1478000	what you really want to see.
1478000	1479000	This experiment
1479000	1480000	is a human face.
1480000	1481000	What will happen?
1481000	1482000	At first,
1482000	1483000	this human face
1483000	1484000	will not be seen at all.
1484000	1485000	We can hide
1485000	1486000	this human face
1486000	1487000	under the flickering
1487000	1489000	for a few seconds.
1489000	1490000	In this experiment,
1490000	1491000	we measure
1491000	1492000	something called
1492000	1493000	suppression time.
1493000	1494000	How long
1494000	1495000	can this thing
1495000	1496000	hide in
1496000	1497000	our unconscious state?
1497000	1498000	Let's assume
1498000	1499000	that a beautiful face
1499000	1500000	and an ugly face
1500000	1501000	can be hidden
1501000	1502000	for a different time.
1502000	1503000	Why?
1503000	1504000	Because in the time
1504000	1505000	we hide,
1505000	1506000	although you can't see the face,
1506000	1507000	but the processing
1507000	1508000	of a beautiful
1508000	1509000	and ugly face
1509000	1510000	is different.
1510000	1512000	This is our assumption.
1512000	1513000	Once you understand
1513000	1514000	this concept,
1514000	1515000	the experiment itself
1515000	1516000	is very simple.
1516000	1517000	Every time we present
1517000	1518000	a face,
1518000	1519000	maybe on the left or right,
1519000	1520000	there will be two groups
1520000	1521000	of flickering things
1521000	1522000	to suppress
1522000	1524000	the consciousness of the face.
1524000	1525000	After each trial,
1525000	1526000	we ask him
1526000	1527000	where the face appeared.
1527000	1528000	Basically,
1528000	1529000	we just make sure
1529000	1530000	he didn't trick us.
1530000	1531000	He really saw this face.
1531000	1532000	After this experiment,
1532000	1533000	we get
1533000	1534000	how long
1534000	1535000	each face
1535000	1536000	can be hidden
1536000	1538000	in the unconscious state.
1538000	1539000	Again,
1539000	1540000	we call it
1540000	1541000	suppression time.
1541000	1542000	We have a lot of faces,
1542000	1543000	but for me,
1543000	1544000	at this time,
1544000	1545000	after collecting this time,
1545000	1546000	I don't know
1546000	1547000	which face is beautiful
1547000	1548000	or not.
1548000	1549000	After the experiment,
1549000	1550000	we will do
1550000	1551000	a rating
1551000	1552000	that they didn't know at first.
1552000	1553000	We want to judge
1553000	1554000	how beautiful
1554000	1555000	this face is.
1555000	1556000	We use all the faces
1556000	1557000	in the experiment
1557000	1558000	and ask them to rate them.
1558000	1559000	Next,
1559000	1560000	we will divide
1560000	1561000	these ratings
1561000	1562000	into less than 4
1562000	1563000	which is an ugly face,
1563000	1564000	and more than 5
1564000	1565000	which is a beautiful face.
1565000	1566000	You can see
1566000	1567000	there is a big difference
1567000	1568000	between the two
1568000	1569000	in the score.
1570000	1571000	This is a very simple homework.
1571000	1572000	After this homework,
1572000	1573000	we can know
1573000	1574000	which face
1574000	1575000	is beautiful
1575000	1576000	for the subject,
1576000	1577000	and which face
1577000	1578000	is not beautiful
1578000	1579000	for the subject.
1579000	1580000	You can imagine
1580000	1581000	that these two faces
1581000	1582000	are a little bit different
1582000	1583000	for each person.
1583000	1584000	In this experiment,
1584000	1585000	the definition of
1585000	1586000	whether a face is beautiful
1586000	1587000	is subjective
1587000	1588000	by the subject.
1588000	1589000	Everyone has
1589000	1590000	a group of beautiful faces
1590000	1591000	and a group of ugly faces.
1591000	1593000	With these two faces,
1593000	1594000	we can calculate
1594000	1595000	how much time
1595000	1596000	these two faces
1596000	1597000	need to spend
1597000	1598000	to enter
1598000	1599000	our conscious state.
1599000	1600000	If you have
1600000	1601000	heard this once,
1601000	1602000	I guess you
1602000	1603000	probably have some guesses.
1603000	1604000	At this time,
1604000	1605000	I want to say
1605000	1606000	that your guess
1606000	1607000	should be correct.
1607000	1608000	Beautiful faces
1608000	1609000	usually enter
1609000	1610000	our conscious state
1610000	1611000	earlier and faster.
1611000	1612000	In fact,
1612000	1613000	the analysis
1613000	1614000	is not so intuitive.
1614000	1615000	Let me explain
1615000	1616000	what this figure
1616000	1617000	is talking about.
1617000	1618000	You can probably
1618000	1619000	look at the first column first.
1619000	1620000	You can see
1620000	1621000	the two dots
1621000	1622000	and then a bar.
1622000	1623000	The red dot
1623000	1624000	is the time
1624000	1625000	a beautiful face
1625000	1626000	needs to spend.
1626000	1627000	In other words,
1627000	1628000	the red dot
1628000	1629000	is about five seconds.
1629000	1630000	The blue dot
1630000	1631000	is the time
1631000	1632000	an ugly face
1632000	1633000	needs to spend.
1633000	1634000	So,
1634000	1635000	the first five seconds
1635000	1636000	are not enough
1636000	1637000	for the victim
1637000	1638000	to see the face.
1638000	1639000	The bottom
1639000	1640000	is the difference
1640000	1641000	between the two dots.
1641000	1642000	The y-axis
1642000	1643000	is on the right.
1643000	1644000	What we are doing
1644000	1645000	here is
1645000	1646000	a three-part ANOVA.
1646000	1647000	We also discussed
1647000	1648000	whether the gender
1648000	1649000	of the victim
1649000	1650000	and the gender
1650000	1651000	of the face
1651000	1652000	interact.
1652000	1653000	In other words,
1653000	1654000	we wanted to see
1654000	1655000	if the beautiful face
1655000	1656000	is a girl,
1656000	1657000	and whether it is
1657000	1658000	more useful
1658000	1659000	for the male victim.
1659000	1660000	On the other hand,
1660000	1661000	whether the beautiful face
1661000	1662000	is more useful
1662000	1663000	for the female victim,
1663000	1664000	we did not find that.
1664000	1665000	So,
1665000	1666000	I will not discuss
1666000	1667000	the gender
1667000	1668000	of the beautiful face
1668000	1669000	in the future.
1669000	1670000	Anyway,
1670000	1671000	what we found here
1671000	1672000	is that
1672000	1673000	the victim
1673000	1674000	usually
1674000	1675000	sees the beautiful face
1675000	1676000	earlier.
1676000	1677000	This implies
1677000	1678000	that
1678000	1679000	during the time
1679000	1680000	the victim
1680000	1681000	cannot see the face,
1681000	1682000	the beautiful face
1682000	1683000	seems to be
1683000	1684000	processed more efficiently
1684000	1685000	or faster.
1685000	1686000	So,
1686000	1687000	during this time,
1687000	1688000	we know that
1688000	1689000	the beautiful face
1689000	1690000	has a shorter
1690000	1691000	suppression time.
1691000	1692000	A longer
1692000	1693000	suppression time
1693000	1694000	is like
1694000	1695000	what I just said.
1695000	1696000	You will see
1696000	1697000	the beautiful face
1697000	1698000	earlier,
1698000	1699000	even if we hide it
1699000	1700000	so that you cannot see it.
1700000	1701000	Next,
1701000	1702000	we will
1702000	1703000	ask
1703000	1704000	why
1704000	1705000	this happens.
1705000	1706000	Here,
1706000	1707000	we have
1707000	1708000	another assumption.
1708000	1709000	Perhaps
1709000	1710000	even if you
1710000	1711000	do not see
1711000	1712000	the beautiful face,
1712000	1713000	it will still
1713000	1714000	attract your attention.
1714000	1715000	This is like
1715000	1716000	what happens
1716000	1717000	when we face
1717000	1718000	the beautiful face
1718000	1719000	that you can see.
1719000	1720000	The beautiful face
1720000	1721000	attracts your attention.
1721000	1722000	How do we
1722000	1723000	prove this?
1723000	1724000	We use a paradigm
1724000	1725000	that world scientists
1725000	1726000	love to use.
1726000	1727000	It is called
1727000	1728000	Post-Nurse Cuing Paradigm.
1728000	1729000	It does not matter
1729000	1730000	what the name is.
1730000	1731000	What does this mean?
1731000	1732000	Imagine
1732000	1733000	your homework.
1733000	1734000	If you have done
1734000	1735000	any psychological homework,
1735000	1736000	there is always a cross
1736000	1737000	that you stare at.
1737000	1738000	After you stare at it,
1738000	1739000	if I give you a cue,
1739000	1740000	for example,
1740000	1741000	it appears on the left.
1741000	1742000	For example,
1742000	1743000	this is a very handsome face.
1743000	1744000	After it appears on the left,
1744000	1745000	I give you a target.
1745000	1746000	In theory,
1746000	1747000	your performance will improve.
1747000	1748000	Why?
1748000	1749000	Because your cue
1749000	1750000	attracts your attention
1750000	1751000	to that place.
1751000	1752000	If the target
1752000	1753000	appears in the same place,
1753000	1754000	your performance will be better.
1754000	1755000	For example,
1755000	1756000	this is the case.
1756000	1757000	You see a handsome face
1757000	1758000	and then you see a target.
1758000	1759000	Then I ask you to judge
1759000	1761000	whether the orientation
1761000	1762000	is to the left
1762000	1763000	or to the right.
1763000	1764000	Very normal,
1764000	1765000	very general
1765000	1766000	visual homework.
1766000	1767000	What does the picture
1767000	1768000	below mean?
1768000	1769000	The green area
1769000	1770000	is usually called
1770000	1771000	Cuing Effect.
1771000	1772000	This is what I call
1772000	1773000	Cuing Effect.
1773000	1774000	It means that
1774000	1775000	at the beginning,
1775000	1776000	about 200 milliseconds ago,
1776000	1777000	the receiver's reaction
1777000	1778000	will become faster
1778000	1779000	and better.
1779000	1780000	The black dot
1780000	1781000	is the location that has been cued.
1781000	1782000	Just like the situation
1782000	1783000	you just saw above.
1783000	1784000	Its reaction speed
1784000	1785000	will be faster than
1785000	1786000	the uncue location.
1786000	1788000	After about 300 milliseconds,
1788000	1790000	this mode will reverse.
1790000	1791000	The receiver
1791000	1792000	in the place
1792000	1793000	that has just been cued
1793000	1794000	will react slower.
1794000	1795000	Then the place
1795000	1796000	that has not been cued
1796000	1798000	will react faster.
1798000	1799000	This thing
1799000	1800000	in this field
1800000	1801000	is usually called
1801000	1802000	Inhibition of Return.
1802000	1804000	It sounds complicated.
1804000	1805000	It's actually very simple.
1805000	1806000	I'll show you a cue
1806000	1808000	that appears on your left.
1808000	1809000	After a while,
1809000	1810000	it disappears.
1810000	1811000	Your visual system
1811000	1812000	is looking for
1812000	1813000	a target
1813000	1814000	in the first 300 to 400 milliseconds.
1814000	1815000	If you can't find anything,
1815000	1816000	your visual system
1816000	1817000	will say
1817000	1818000	that there's nothing there,
1818000	1819000	so we're going to
1819000	1820000	look for other places.
1820000	1821000	So if the target
1821000	1822000	appears
1822000	1823000	in the original place,
1823000	1824000	your performance will be worse
1824000	1825000	because your visual system
1825000	1826000	has already started
1826000	1827000	to look for other places.
1827000	1828000	It even has a
1828000	1829000	suppression effect
1829000	1830000	on the original place.
1830000	1831000	This is called Inhibition of Return.
1831000	1832000	Why am I talking about this?
1832000	1833000	It means that
1833000	1834000	this has something to do
1834000	1835000	with the result
1835000	1836000	we're going to find later.
1836000	1837000	What do we do
1837000	1838000	in this experiment?
1838000	1839000	Basically,
1839000	1840000	we show them
1840000	1841000	two faces at a time.
1841000	1842000	One is pretty,
1842000	1843000	one is not pretty.
1843000	1844000	Then we use
1844000	1845000	this bright stimulation
1845000	1846000	to suppress it
1846000	1848000	so that the receiver can't see it.
1848000	1849000	Then let it make
1849000	1851000	a very simple judgment.
1851000	1852000	The line is to the left,
1852000	1853000	the line is to the right.
1853000	1854000	This is the same as
1854000	1855000	what I just said.
1855000	1856000	It's easy to judge
1856000	1857000	if this tilt
1857000	1858000	is to the left or to the right.
1858000	1859000	Then we ask it a lot of questions
1859000	1860000	to make sure
1860000	1861000	it really didn't see this face.
1861000	1862000	Then we can also
1862000	1864000	do some calibration
1864000	1865000	to make sure
1865000	1866000	we can always show
1866000	1869000	the correct brightness.
1869000	1870000	If you make your face
1870000	1871000	very bright,
1871000	1872000	sometimes they will
1872000	1873000	suddenly see that face.
1873000	1874000	So we will have
1874000	1875000	a trial-by-trial
1875000	1876000	calibration.
1876000	1878000	If you're not interested in this,
1878000	1879000	it doesn't matter at all.
1879000	1881000	We do a lot of color balance.
1881000	1882000	The only thing you need to know here
1882000	1883000	is that you can see
1883000	1885000	this cold face is black and white.
1885000	1886000	Because we even
1886000	1887000	remove the color.
1887000	1888000	We don't want the color
1888000	1890000	to affect the result of the experiment.
1890000	1892000	Then we adjust the brightness
1892000	1893000	to the average brightness
1893000	1894000	of the ugly face
1894000	1896000	and the pretty face.
1896000	1897000	At this time,
1897000	1898000	you can guess
1898000	1900000	that after seeing
1900000	1901000	a pretty face
1901000	1902000	or an ugly face
1902000	1903000	that you can't see,
1903000	1904000	which side
1904000	1905000	of your performance
1905000	1906000	will be better?
1906000	1907000	Instinctively speaking,
1907000	1908000	it seems that
1908000	1909000	you see a pretty face
1909000	1910000	and your attention
1910000	1911000	is drawn to it
1911000	1912000	and your performance
1912000	1913000	will be better.
1913000	1914000	In fact, we found that
1914000	1915000	it's the other way around.
1915000	1916000	The red dot
1916000	1917000	is the visual performance
1917000	1918000	of the invisible pretty face
1918000	1919000	that they can't see
1919000	1920000	after they see it.
1920000	1921000	The visual performance
1921000	1922000	of the visual work
1922000	1923000	is the red dot.
1923000	1924000	The blue dot
1924000	1925000	is the performance
1925000	1926000	after they see
1926000	1928000	the ugly face.
1928000	1929000	You can see
1929000	1930000	that most collectors
1930000	1932000	have the same pattern.
1932000	1933000	After they see
1933000	1934000	a pretty face,
1934000	1935000	their performance
1935000	1936000	will obviously deteriorate.
1936000	1937000	There is a pretty obvious result
1937000	1941000	overall.
1941000	1944000	Here is my explanation.
1944000	1945000	This is what I just told you
1945000	1946000	about the Inhibition of Return.
1946000	1947000	This is a
1947000	1950000	long-distance explanation.
1950000	1951000	Simply put,
1951000	1952000	the time it takes
1952000	1954000	for us to show the human face
1954000	1955000	to the collector
1955000	1956000	to see the real target,
1956000	1957000	which is the thing
1957000	1958000	on the left and right,
1958000	1960000	is more than one second.
1960000	1961000	It's very long
1961000	1962000	and falls into
1962000	1963000	the Inhibition of Return.
1963000	1964000	We think
1964000	1965000	it's possible that
1965000	1966000	after the collector
1966000	1967000	sees the pretty face,
1967000	1969000	the target doesn't show up.
1969000	1970000	He has gone somewhere else
1970000	1971000	and the target only shows up.
1971000	1972000	So his performance
1972000	1973000	will deteriorate.
1973000	1974000	Whether it deteriorates
1974000	1975000	or improves,
1975000	1976000	it means that
1976000	1977000	the pretty face
1977000	1978000	has attracted
1978000	1979000	some kind of attention
1979000	1980000	to you.
1980000	1981000	That's the first point.
1981000	1982000	The second point is that
1982000	1983000	there may be
1983000	1984000	another form of
1984000	1985000	attention
1985000	1986000	here.
1986000	1987000	It means
1987000	1988000	some kind of
1988000	1989000	feature-based attention.
1989000	1990000	What does this mean?
1990000	1991000	When the invisible
1991000	1992000	pretty face
1992000	1993000	appears,
1993000	1994000	your attention
1994000	1995000	may be placed
1995000	1996000	on that face,
1996000	1997000	on that pretty face.
1997000	1998000	At this time,
1998000	1999000	if I ask you to do
1999000	2000000	another assignment,
2000000	2001000	it's hard for your attention
2001000	2002000	to be drawn
2002000	2003000	from that pretty face
2003000	2004000	to that invisible face.
2004000	2005000	So your performance
2005000	2006000	will deteriorate.
2006000	2007000	This is also a possibility.
2007000	2008000	It's a bit like
2008000	2009000	in your daily life.
2009000	2010000	If you see
2012000	2013000	I really don't want to
2013000	2014000	mention Jin Cheng-wu.
2014000	2015000	If you see
2015000	2016000	Xin Yuan-jie
2016000	2017000	walking past you,
2017000	2018000	at the same time
2018000	2019000	he asks you to do
2019000	2020000	another thing,
2020000	2021000	you may be distracted
2021000	2022000	by him.
2022000	2023000	The performance
2023000	2024000	of the assignment
2024000	2025000	you do
2025000	2026000	will deteriorate.
2026000	2027000	This is also a
2027000	2028000	possible phenomenon.
2028000	2029000	These are two different
2029000	2030000	possibilities
2030000	2031000	that can explain
2031000	2032000	the results here.
2032000	2033000	I promise you
2033000	2034000	not to talk about
2034000	2035000	too much control.
2035000	2036000	I'll just talk about one.
2036000	2037000	One possibility
2037000	2038000	is that
2038000	2039000	maybe between
2039000	2040000	a pretty face
2040000	2041000	and an invisible face,
2041000	2042000	for example,
2042000	2043000	the skin condition
2043000	2044000	is a bit different,
2044000	2045000	or the hair volume
2045000	2046000	is a bit different.
2046000	2047000	So these
2047000	2048000	more local things
2048000	2049000	actually determine
2049000	2050000	our results.
2050000	2051000	Our approach
2051000	2052000	is to turn
2052000	2053000	our face over.
2053000	2054000	If our experiment results
2054000	2055000	are really determined
2055000	2056000	by these local things,
2056000	2057000	our experiment results
2057000	2058000	should disappear.
2058000	2059000	Indeed,
2059000	2060000	if it is determined
2060000	2061000	by these local things,
2061000	2062000	our experiment results
2062000	2063000	should look the same.
2063000	2064000	If it is determined
2064000	2065000	by the face,
2065000	2066000	the result will remain.
2066000	2067000	You can see
2067000	2068000	when we copy,
2068000	2069000	only when the face
2069000	2070000	is upright
2070000	2071000	will we find
2071000	2072000	this phenomenon.
2072000	2073000	As long as the face
2073000	2074000	is turned over,
2074000	2075000	you can see
2075000	2076000	that his hair
2076000	2077000	and other features
2077000	2078000	are still there,
2078000	2079000	but the result
2079000	2080000	disappears.
2080000	2081000	This proves
2081000	2082000	that this is
2082000	2083000	really a human face phenomenon.
2083000	2084000	In conclusion,
2084000	2085000	if we hide
2085000	2086000	these attractive faces
2086000	2087000	that are attractive
2087000	2088000	to you,
2088000	2089000	these pretty faces
2089000	2090000	will be easier
2090000	2091000	to enter
2091000	2092000	our medical content.
2092000	2093000	Our theory
2093000	2094000	is to imply
2094000	2095000	that the brain
2095000	2096000	deals with
2096000	2097000	these attractive faces
2097000	2098000	more quickly
2098000	2099000	and efficiently
2099000	2100000	when they are
2100000	2101000	unconscious.
2101000	2102000	On the other hand,
2102000	2103000	if we hide
2103000	2104000	this face
2104000	2105000	so that the recipient
2105000	2106000	can't see it,
2106000	2107000	we find that
2107000	2108000	the face
2108000	2109000	they can't see
2109000	2110000	if it is attractive
2110000	2111000	can still
2111000	2112000	affect our attention
2112000	2113000	and further affect
2113000	2114000	their next
2114000	2115000	very simple
2115000	2116000	visual performance
2116000	2117000	behavior.
2117000	2118000	I hope
2118000	2119000	that these
2119000	2120000	tips
2120000	2121000	have convinced you
2121000	2122000	that attractive faces
2122000	2123000	are not only
2123000	2124000	easy to deal with
2124000	2125000	in daily life
2125000	2126000	but also
2126000	2127000	affect our behavior.
2127000	2128000	Even when I hide
2128000	2129000	this face
2129000	2130000	and you can't see it,
2130000	2131000	it still changes
2131000	2132000	your behavior.
2132000	2133000	Let me pause
2133000	2134000	here
2134000	2135000	to see if
2135000	2136000	there are any questions.
2138000	2139000	There are some questions
2139000	2140000	in the chat.
2140000	2141000	You may...
2141000	2142000	Yes, I can see them.
2143000	2144000	Let me see.
2144000	2145000	I just saw
2145000	2146000	Zhang Yanyong
2146000	2147000	say,
2147000	2148000	Wait, that's me.
2148000	2149000	Um...
2157000	2158000	Okay.
2160000	2161000	Let me start
2161000	2162000	with this one.
2164000	2165000	If the recipient
2165000	2166000	says there is no emotional face...
2167000	2168000	Say there is no emotional face
2168000	2169000	is a little scary.
2170000	2171000	Oh, okay, okay.
2171000	2172000	So this
2172000	2173000	emotion
2173000	2174000	in this...
2174000	2175000	These faces
2175000	2176000	have no emotion.
2176000	2177000	This is
2177000	2178000	defined by
2178000	2179000	the creator
2179000	2180000	of the face database.
2180000	2181000	When they create
2181000	2182000	these faces,
2182000	2183000	there are many situations.
2183000	2184000	So you can
2184000	2185000	take out
2185000	2186000	a happy face
2186000	2187000	from the face database
2187000	2188000	or a sad face
2188000	2189000	or an angry face
2189000	2190000	from the face database.
2190000	2191000	I take out
2191000	2192000	a neutral face.
2193000	2194000	So in other words,
2194000	2195000	when doing this experiment,
2195000	2196000	if the recipient
2196000	2197000	tells me
2197000	2198000	he feels
2198000	2199000	very strong emotions
2199000	2200000	in these faces,
2200000	2201000	I will take
2201000	2202000	the recipient away.
2202000	2203000	I hope
2203000	2204000	that answers
2204000	2205000	the question.
2205000	2206000	So...
2207000	2208000	This is
2208000	2209000	a very good question
2209000	2210000	about image.
2210000	2211000	Because there is
2211000	2212000	an early study
2212000	2213000	that found that
2213000	2214000	a...
2214000	2215000	They use...
2215000	2216000	What they do
2216000	2217000	is more...
2217000	2218000	More...
2218000	2219000	Interesting.
2219000	2220000	They show
2220000	2221000	the naked body
2221000	2222000	to everyone.
2223000	2224000	They found
2224000	2225000	that
2225000	2226000	the naked body of a girl
2226000	2227000	has an effect
2227000	2228000	on the attention
2228000	2229000	of the male recipient.
2229000	2230000	This is
2230000	2231000	similar to our paradigm.
2231000	2232000	He can't see
2232000	2233000	the naked body.
2233000	2234000	But they found
2234000	2235000	that they have
2235000	2236000	an effect on attention.
2236000	2237000	The naked body of a man
2237000	2238000	has an effect
2238000	2239000	on the female recipient.
2239000	2240000	They also found
2240000	2241000	that the naked body of a man
2241000	2242000	has an effect
2242000	2243000	on...
2243000	2244000	The male
2244000	2245000	gay recipient
2245000	2246000	also has an effect.
2246000	2247000	So your image
2247000	2248000	will determine
2248000	2249000	which visual material
2249000	2250000	affects you.
2250000	2251000	In our research,
2251000	2252000	we didn't ask
2252000	2253000	this question.
2253000	2254000	Because we didn't even
2254000	2255000	see the effect of gender.
2255000	2256000	And we don't
2256000	2257000	have that many people.
2257000	2258000	So...
2258000	2259000	I can't answer
2259000	2260000	if it has anything to do
2260000	2261000	with image.
2261000	2262000	Yes.
2262000	2263000	Let's
2263000	2264000	look at the next question.
2267000	2268000	Uh...
2268000	2269000	This is
2269000	2270000	a question from Zhang Yiping.
2270000	2271000	How long
2271000	2272000	does it take
2272000	2273000	to hide different visual materials?
2273000	2274000	Which visual material
2274000	2275000	will be found?
2275000	2276000	Yes.
2276000	2277000	One of the key points
2277000	2278000	is the visual material...
2278000	2279000	I'll tell you
2279000	2280000	the whole question.
2280000	2281000	My method
2281000	2282000	is to hide
2282000	2283000	things
2283000	2284000	so that
2284000	2285000	people can't see them
2285000	2286000	and become blind.
2286000	2287000	Then throw in
2287000	2288000	the visual material
2288000	2289000	and see which
2289000	2290000	visual material
2290000	2291000	comes out first.
2291000	2292000	That's right.
2292000	2293000	But the key point
2293000	2294000	is that these visual materials
2294000	2295000	should be
2295000	2296000	two different
2296000	2297000	visual materials.
2297000	2298000	For example,
2298000	2299000	the first example
2299000	2300000	is the face
2300000	2301000	and the house.
2301000	2302000	That...
2302000	2303000	can affect
2303000	2304000	the sound
2304000	2305000	we explain
2305000	2306000	too much.
2306000	2307000	Because it may
2307000	2308000	not be attractive.
2308000	2309000	It may just be...
2309000	2310000	For example,
2310000	2311000	your visual system
2311000	2312000	may like square things
2312000	2313000	or round things
2313000	2314000	or something like that.
2314000	2315000	So the general practice
2315000	2316000	is that your visual material
2316000	2317000	should look a bit like.
2317000	2318000	In the next experiment,
2318000	2319000	it will actually
2319000	2320000	talk about similar things.
2320000	2321000	For example,
2321000	2322000	you want to control
2322000	2323000	his...
2323000	2324000	Like in this experiment,
2324000	2325000	we control the color
2325000	2326000	or its brightness,
2326000	2327000	etc.
2327000	2328000	Let us...
2328000	2329000	The only change
2329000	2330000	in the sound
2330000	2331000	is only one or two.
2331000	2332000	This way,
2332000	2333000	we can know
2333000	2334000	that in the end
2334000	2335000	if they are processed
2335000	2336000	and there is a time difference,
2336000	2337000	what is the time difference
2337000	2338000	that affects?
2338000	2339000	Then the blind spot
2339000	2341000	of the visual
2341000	2342000	is that
2342000	2343000	we have another experiment
2343000	2344000	that is trying this thing.
2344000	2345000	OK.
2345000	2346000	Maybe we can
2346000	2347000	talk offline
2347000	2348000	later.
2348000	2349000	The material of the eyes
2349000	2350000	is not,
2350000	2351000	but...
2351000	2352000	In fact,
2352000	2353000	at the beginning
2353000	2354000	of the introduction,
2354000	2355000	I said that
2355000	2356000	I have been doing eye movements recently
2356000	2357000	because I am interested
2357000	2358000	in how to use eye movements
2358000	2359000	to further study
2359000	2360000	my past research.
2360000	2361000	If you are interested,
2361000	2362000	we can talk later.
2362000	2363000	Why are there
2363000	2364000	so many questions?
2364000	2365000	Sorry.
2365000	2366000	Attractiveness
2366000	2367000	is asked
2367000	2368000	by subjective rating.
2368000	2369000	Attractiveness
2369000	2370000	of a baby.
2370000	2371000	In fact,
2371000	2372000	I was not very accurate
2372000	2373000	just now.
2373000	2374000	Attractiveness
2374000	2375000	is defined
2375000	2376000	by adults first.
2376000	2377000	So,
2377000	2378000	for example,
2378000	2379000	in the study
2379000	2380000	of a baby,
2380000	2381000	it is said that
2381000	2382000	it will find
2382000	2383000	a group
2383000	2384000	of faces
2384000	2385000	that adults
2385000	2386000	think are beautiful
2386000	2387000	and some faces
2387000	2388000	that adults
2388000	2389000	think are not beautiful
2389000	2390000	to show the baby.
2390000	2391000	So,
2391000	2392000	the interesting thing
2392000	2393000	is that
2393000	2394000	these children
2394000	2395000	may be born
2395000	2396000	a few months
2396000	2397000	or even younger.
2397000	2398000	They have not yet
2398000	2399000	learned
2399000	2400000	the social rules
2400000	2401000	of the situation,
2401000	2402000	but they will
2402000	2403000	pay more attention
2403000	2404000	to the more beautiful
2404000	2405000	face
2405000	2406000	and spend
2406000	2407000	more time
2407000	2408000	looking at it.
2408000	2409000	This is why
2409000	2410000	some people want to claim that
2410000	2411000	face-to-face
2411000	2412000	or face-to-face
2412000	2413000	attractiveness
2413000	2414000	may be a very early
2414000	2415000	process.
2415000	2416000	In fact,
2416000	2417000	I do not have to
2417000	2418000	learn
2418000	2419000	to achieve it.
2419000	2420000	Yes,
2420000	2421000	then,
2423000	2424000	is it related to
2424000	2425000	symmetry?
2426000	2427000	In this experiment,
2427000	2428000	I did not manipulate,
2428000	2429000	but
2430000	2431000	many studies
2431000	2432000	on face-to-face
2432000	2433000	attractiveness
2433000	2434000	will discuss
2434000	2435000	whether the face
2435000	2436000	is symmetrical,
2436000	2437000	for example,
2437000	2438000	is your face
2438000	2439000	a
2439000	2440000	public face
2440000	2441000	or an average face
2441000	2442000	will greatly affect
2442000	2443000	whether this face
2443000	2444000	is beautiful or not.
2444000	2445000	In my experiment,
2445000	2446000	because
2446000	2447000	I did not want to manipulate
2447000	2448000	how to make a face
2448000	2449000	beautiful
2449000	2450000	or how to make a face
2450000	2451000	not beautiful,
2451000	2452000	so my approach is
2452000	2453000	to catch these faces
2453000	2454000	and let my collector
2454000	2455000	judge whether they are beautiful or not.
2455000	2456000	My guess is
2456000	2457000	that if I can
2457000	2458000	control the aspect ratio,
2458000	2459000	for example,
2459000	2460000	the same face
2460000	2461000	and make it more symmetrical
2461000	2462000	or more asymmetrical
2462000	2463000	to affect its attractiveness,
2463000	2464000	similar results
2464000	2465000	should be replicated.
2466000	2467000	OK,
2467000	2468000	that's about it.
2468000	2469000	I will continue,
2469000	2471000	otherwise we may not finish.
2471000	2472000	OK.
2473000	2475000	This is the first experiment.
2476000	2477000	I hope
2477000	2478000	I have convinced everyone
2478000	2479000	that a face
2479000	2480000	is actually
2480000	2481000	when you do not see
2481000	2482000	your brain
2482000	2483000	can read a lot of
2483000	2484000	relevant information.
2485000	2486000	The second is to talk about grammar.
2486000	2487000	As I just said,
2487000	2488000	this concept
2488000	2489000	will be a little more
2489000	2490000	complicated than
2490000	2491000	the previous one,
2491000	2492000	but it is not really complicated.
2492000	2493000	I will talk about
2493000	2494000	what I want to talk about
2494000	2495000	grammar.
2495000	2496000	Generally speaking,
2496000	2497000	grammar
2497000	2498000	has a lot of
2498000	2499000	different levels.
2499000	2500000	For example,
2500000	2501000	each word
2501000	2502000	has a different
2502000	2503000	lexical category.
2503000	2504000	It may be a verb,
2504000	2505000	a noun,
2505000	2506000	or a connected word,
2506000	2507000	etc.
2507000	2508000	The grammar I'm talking about
2508000	2509000	is
2509000	2510000	when we read
2510000	2511000	a sentence,
2511000	2512000	the ability to
2512000	2513000	put different words
2513000	2514000	in the right place.
2514000	2515000	Generally speaking,
2515000	2516000	we would think
2516000	2517000	this is a high-level ability.
2517000	2518000	Why?
2518000	2519000	Because I need to
2519000	2520000	calculate something,
2520000	2521000	I need to know
2521000	2522000	that this word
2522000	2523000	should be in the first place,
2523000	2524000	that word should follow
2524000	2525000	that word,
2525000	2526000	so it is a
2526000	2527000	high-level ability.
2527000	2528000	For example,
2528000	2529000	if I show you
2529000	2530000	some words now,
2530000	2531000	these are very
2531000	2532000	simple words,
2532000	2533000	so you can see
2533000	2534000	that I can understand
2534000	2535000	every word,
2535000	2536000	but I'm just
2536000	2537000	arranging them now,
2537000	2538000	so you don't understand
2538000	2539000	what this sentence is for.
2539000	2540000	If I want to understand it,
2540000	2541000	I usually need to
2541000	2542000	arrange it in the
2542000	2543000	right place.
2543000	2544000	Once it is in the
2544000	2545000	right place,
2545000	2546000	you may understand
2546000	2547000	in a second
2547000	2548000	that this sentence
2548000	2549000	is about this thing.
2549000	2550000	The question I want to
2550000	2551000	ask in this experiment
2551000	2552000	is that
2552000	2553000	when our brain
2553000	2554000	does not see
2554000	2555000	these words,
2555000	2556000	how do we
2556000	2557000	get this information?
2557000	2558000	This is the
2558000	2559000	main problem.
2559000	2560000	Then I will
2560000	2561000	tell you about
2561000	2562000	a series of
2562000	2563000	research that
2563000	2564000	we have done.
2564000	2565000	In fact,
2565000	2566000	when we study,
2566000	2567000	of course,
2567000	2568000	we don't use
2568000	2569000	such a complicated sentence.
2569000	2570000	We can,
2570000	2571000	but this is the
2571000	2572000	first stage,
2572000	2573000	so we use
2573000	2574000	some simpler sentences.
2574000	2575000	I use some
2575000	2576000	three-word sentences.
2576000	2577000	These sentences
2577000	2578000	are normal,
2578000	2579000	correct,
2579000	2580000	and legally reasonable
2580000	2581000	sentences.
2581000	2582000	There is this
2582000	2583000	subject,
2583000	2584000	verb,
2584000	2585000	and the two verbs
2585000	2586000	are not legal
2586000	2587000	in English.
2587000	2588000	These are the
2588000	2589000	sentences we
2589000	2590000	really use.
2590000	2591000	You can see
2591000	2592000	birdseedworms and
2592000	2593000	birdseeddrinks,
2593000	2594000	so birds eat
2594000	2595000	and drink.
2595000	2596000	Drinking
2596000	2597000	these two verbs
2597000	2598000	together is
2598000	2599000	an incorrect
2599000	2600000	grammatical form.
2600000	2601000	If anyone here
2601000	2602000	is doing language
2602000	2603000	or psychological
2603000	2604000	language studies,
2604000	2605000	we also control
2605000	2606000	the font
2606000	2607000	of these words
2607000	2608000	and their length
2608000	2609000	to ensure that
2609000	2610000	like we just
2610000	2611000	talked about
2611000	2612000	when we do
2612000	2613000	these experiments,
2613000	2614000	we can see
2614000	2615000	if the lower
2615000	2616000	or different
2616000	2617000	faces
2617000	2618000	have been
2618000	2619000	properly controlled.
2619000	2620000	We just need to
2620000	2621000	tell them that
2621000	2622000	we have
2622000	2623000	controlled the
2623000	2624000	other faces.
2624000	2625000	We want to
2625000	2626000	make sure
2626000	2627000	that the main
2627000	2628000	difference between
2628000	2629000	these two situations
2629000	2630000	is that
2630000	2631000	one is
2631000	2632000	legally reasonable
2632000	2633000	and the other
2633000	2634000	is legally
2634000	2635000	unreasonable.
2635000	2636000	The question
2636000	2637000	is how
2637000	2638000	do we prove
2638000	2639000	that our
2639000	2640000	brain
2640000	2641000	can't see
2641000	2642000	these keywords
2643000	2644000	and still
2644000	2645000	be able to
2645000	2646000	correct
2646000	2647000	grammatical errors
2647000	2648000	when we can't
2648000	2649000	see them?
2649000	2650000	Our approach
2650000	2651000	is very similar
2651000	2652000	to what we
2652000	2653000	talked about
2653000	2654000	earlier.
2654000	2655000	Our approach
2655000	2656000	is to
2656000	2657000	show the
2657000	2658000	subject
2658000	2659000	the first
2659000	2660000	two words
2660000	2661000	so that
2661000	2662000	they can
2662000	2663000	clearly see
2663000	2664000	the first
2664000	2665000	two words
2665000	2666000	so that
2666000	2667000	they can
2667000	2668000	have some
2668000	2669000	grammatical
2669000	2670000	expectations.
2670000	2671000	After
2671000	2672000	this,
2672000	2673000	we have
2673000	2674000	some
2674000	2675000	catch tasks
2675000	2676000	to make
2676000	2677000	sure that
2677000	2678000	the subject
2678000	2679000	can see
2679000	2680000	the first
2680000	2681000	two words
2681000	2682000	and
2682000	2683000	make sure
2683000	2684000	that
2684000	2685000	the subject
2685000	2686000	can read
2686000	2687000	the first
2687000	2688000	two words
2688000	2689000	in
2689000	2690000	each trial.
2690000	2691000	The
2691000	2692000	key point
2692000	2693000	is the
2693000	2694000	detection
2694000	2695000	task.
2695000	2696000	We are
2696000	2697000	measuring
2697000	2698000	the suppression
2698000	2699000	time.
2699000	2700000	How long
2700000	2701000	will it
2701000	2702000	take for
2702000	2703000	the
2703000	2704000	two
2704000	2705000	words to
2705000	2706000	be seen?
2706000	2707000	The
2707000	2708000	red bar
2708000	2709000	is the
2709000	2710000	time it
2710000	2711000	takes to
2711000	2712000	see the
2712000	2713000	word.
2713000	2714000	The
2714000	2715000	red bar
2715000	2716000	is the
2716000	2717000	time it
2717000	2718000	takes to
2718000	2719000	see the
2719000	2720000	word.
2720000	2721000	The
2721000	2722000	red bar
2722000	2723000	is the
2723000	2724000	time it
2724000	2725000	takes to
2725000	2726000	see the
2726000	2727000	word.
2787000	2790000	The
2790000	2791000	time it
2791000	2793000	takes to
2793000	2794000	see the
2794000	2794000	
2817000	2819000	word,
2819000	2820000	the
2820000	2821000	difference in
2821000	2822000	their
2822000	2823000	reaction.
2823000	2824000	Is it
2824000	2825000	really because of
2825000	2826000	grammar?
2826000	2827000	For example,
2827000	2828000	if you look at
2828000	2829000	the words we
2829000	2830000	use,
2830000	2831000	one word is
2831000	2832000	always a
2832000	2833000	verb,
2833000	2834000	one word is
2834000	2835000	always a noun,
2835000	2836000	maybe the
2836000	2837000	difference between
2837000	2838000	the two is
2838000	2839000	the verb and
2839000	2840000	noun,
2840000	2841000	or maybe the
2841000	2842000	noun and
2842000	2843000	the verb
2843000	2844000	look a little
2844000	2845000	different,
2845000	2846000	so the
2846000	2847000	effect should
2847000	2848000	disappear after
2848000	2849000	the grammatical structure
2849000	2850000	of the sentence
2850000	2851000	is destroyed
2851000	2852000	because there is
2852000	2853000	no grammar at
2853000	2854000	this time,
2854000	2855000	but you
2855000	2856000	look at the
2856000	2857000	following two
2857000	2858000	words, the
2858000	2859000	key word is
2859000	2860000	actually the
2860000	2861000	same.
2861000	2862000	In these two
2862000	2863000	experiments,
2863000	2864000	our effect
2864000	2865000	disappeared,
2865000	2866000	which means
2866000	2867000	that we
2867000	2868000	found that
2868000	2869000	the phenomenon
2869000	2870000	really needs
2870000	2871000	that word to
2871000	2872000	be hidden
2872000	2873000	unconsciously,
2873000	2874000	that is,
2874000	2875000	it is
2875000	2876000	still the same
2876000	2877000	key word,
2877000	2878000	the effect will
2878000	2879000	disappear.
2879000	2880000	The next
2880000	2881000	question we ask
2881000	2882000	is actually after
2882000	2883000	several years,
2883000	2884000	the question we
2884000	2885000	ask is that
2885000	2886000	this kind of
2886000	2887000	experiment seems to
2887000	2888000	still rely on
2888000	2889000	us to see
2889000	2890000	the grammar error
2890000	2891000	in the end
2891000	2892000	because the
2892000	2893000	receiver sees
2893000	2894000	and then the
2894000	2895000	reaction
2895000	2896000	sees the
2896000	2897000	reaction,
2897000	2898000	so is there
2898000	2899000	a possibility
2899000	2900000	that we
2900000	2901000	must see
2901000	2902000	such an
2902000	2903000	experiment result
2903000	2904000	?
2904000	2905000	Is there
2905000	2906000	a possibility
2906000	2907000	that we can
2907000	2908000	prove that the
2908000	2909000	grammar error
2909000	2910000	itself can
2910000	2911000	really be
2911000	2912000	independently
2912000	2913000	processed
2913000	2914000	unconsciously?
2914000	2915000	Our approach
2915000	2916000	is that
2916000	2917000	otherwise we
2917000	2918000	hide the
2918000	2919000	whole part of
2919000	2920000	the sentence
2920000	2921000	and then
2921000	2922000	we will
2922000	2923000	hide it
2923000	2924000	and then
2924000	2925000	there will
2925000	2926000	be a few
2926000	2927000	advantages.
2927000	2928000	I will
2928000	2929000	tell you later
2929000	2930000	that our
2930000	2931000	approach
2931000	2932000	is to
2932000	2933000	hide the
2933000	2934000	real word
2934000	2935000	or the
2935000	2936000	fake word
2936000	2937000	in English.
2937000	2938000	At this
2938000	2939000	time, you
2939000	2940000	can see that
2940000	2941000	there are
2941000	2942000	some different
2942000	2943000	conditions here,
2943000	2944000	such as that
2944000	2945000	it can be a
2945000	2946000	grammatically
2946000	2947000	reasonable word
2947000	2948000	or it can be
2948000	2949000	a grammatically
2949000	2950000	unreasonable word
2950000	2951000	or it is
2951000	2952000	a fake word.
2952000	2953000	The
2953000	2954000	fake word
2954000	2955000	actually has
2955000	2956000	nothing to do
2956000	2957000	with our
2957000	2958000	analysis,
2958000	2959000	just that
2959000	2960000	we have to
2960000	2961000	balance the
2961000	2962000	amount of
2962000	2963000	words that
2963000	2964000	he can't see
2964000	2965000	if he can
2965000	2966000	handle the
2966000	2967000	two words
2967000	2968000	that he can't
2968000	2969000	see,
2969000	2970000	half of the
2970000	2971000	sentence,
2971000	2972000	which may
2972000	2973000	affect
2973000	2974000	how he
2974000	2975000	judges the
2975000	2976000	grammatically
2976000	2977000	reasonable and
2977000	2978000	unreasonable
2978000	2979000	words.
2979000	2980000	There are
2980000	2981000	two points
2981000	2982000	here.
2982000	2983000	The first
2983000	2984000	is that
2984000	2985000	they can't
2985000	2986000	see the
2986000	2987000	words hidden
2987000	2988000	in the
2988000	2989000	front.
2989000	2990000	We have
2990000	2991000	run some
2991000	2992000	tests to
2992000	2993000	see if
2993000	2994000	it has
2994000	2995000	anything to
2995000	2996000	do with
2996000	2997000	grammar,
2997000	2998000	so the
2998000	2999000	point is that
2999000	3000000	he can't
3000000	3001000	see the
3001000	3002000	words in
3002000	3003000	front and
3003000	3004000	he doesn't
3004000	3005000	know if
3005000	3006000	the key
3006000	3007000	words are
3007000	3008000	grammatically
3008000	3009000	wrong or
3009000	3010000	correct,
3010000	3011000	but in
3011000	3012000	this case
3012000	3013000	we still
3013000	3014000	find that
3014000	3015000	when the
3015000	3016000	word is
3016000	3017000	wrong,
3017000	3018000	its
3018000	3019000	reaction
3019000	3020000	speed
3020000	3021000	is
3021000	3022000	slow.
3022000	3023000	In the
3023000	3024000	earlier experiment,
3024000	3025000	we found that
3025000	3026000	if I let the
3026000	3027000	recipient read the
3027000	3028000	first half of the
3028000	3029000	sentence,
3029000	3030000	when the
3030000	3031000	last word
3031000	3032000	does not
3032000	3033000	match the
3033000	3034000	grammar of
3034000	3035000	the
3035000	3036000	sentence,
3036000	3037000	it will
3037000	3038000	enter our
3038000	3039000	conscious state
3039000	3040000	earlier.
3040000	3041000	This is
3041000	3042000	a bit like
3042000	3043000	the concept
3043000	3044000	of discussing
3044000	3045000	the face
3045000	3046000	at the
3046000	3047000	beginning .
3047000	3048000	At this
3048000	3049000	time,
3049000	3050000	the words
3050000	3051000	that do not
3051000	3052000	match the
3052000	3053000	grammar will
3053000	3054000	even be faster.
3054000	3055000	On the
3055000	3056000	contrary,
3056000	3057000	in the last
3057000	3058000	experiment,
3058000	3059000	we let you
3059000	3060000	see that
3060000	3061000	if you read
3061000	3062000	a sentence
3062000	3063000	that you
3063000	3064000	can't
3064000	3065000	see at
3065000	3066000	the beginning
3066000	3067000	,
3067000	3068000	even if
3068000	3069000	you don't
3069000	3070000	know if
3070000	3071000	the
3071000	3072000	word is
3072000	3073000	grammatically
3073000	3074000	correct or
3074000	3075000	wrong,
3075000	3076000	your
3076000	3077000	reaction
3077000	3078000	will
3078000	3079000	be faster.
3079000	3080000	For some
3080000	3081000	reasons,
3081000	3082000	our brains
3082000	3083000	tend to
3083000	3084000	deal with
3084000	3085000	grammatical
3085000	3086000	errors more
3086000	3087000	quickly.
3087000	3088000	Of course,
3088000	3089000	there are
3089000	3090000	various experiments
3090000	3091000	in psychological
3091000	3092000	linguistics
3092000	3093000	.
3093000	3094000	When you
3094000	3095000	read something,
3095000	3096000	if there is
3096000	3097000	a grammatical
3097000	3098000	error,
3098000	3099000	it will
3099000	3100000	become a
3100000	3101000	more salient
3101000	3102000	stimulus.
3102000	3103000	Sometimes it
3103000	3104000	is more
3104000	3105000	popular and
3105000	3106000	we see it.
3106000	3107000	However,
3107000	3108000	this is the
3108000	3109000	second experiment.
3109000	3110000	I hope that
3110000	3111000	these experiments
3111000	3112000	will convince you
3112000	3113000	that the
3113000	3114000	grammatical
3114000	3115000	processing of
3115000	3116000	sentences
3116000	3117000	sounds like a
3117000	3118000	relatively
3118000	3119000	high-level
3119000	3120000	cognitive process
3120000	3121000	that can also
3121000	3122000	occur when we
3122000	3123000	don't see
3123000	3124000	words.
3124000	3125000	Let me
3125000	3126000	answer a
3126000	3127000	few more
3127000	3128000	questions.
3132000	3133000	There is a
3133000	3134000	problem that
3134000	3135000	Chinese reading is
3135000	3136000	less affected by
3136000	3137000	order.
3137000	3138000	This is a
3138000	3139000	good question.
3139000	3140000	I have not
3140000	3141000	tested this experiment
3141000	3142000	on Chinese
3142000	3143000	users.
3143000	3144000	I have
3144000	3145000	always wanted to
3145000	3146000	try it.
3146000	3147000	There are
3147000	3148000	two
3148000	3149000	relative
3149000	3150000	theories.
3150000	3151000	One is that
3151000	3152000	Chinese reading is
3152000	3153000	relatively less
3153000	3154000	affected by
3154000	3155000	order.
3155000	3156000	Word order
3156000	3157000	is less
3157000	3158000	important.
3158000	3159000	Perhaps this
3159000	3160000	effect will not
3160000	3161000	come out.
3161000	3162000	The other
3162000	3163000	is that it
3163000	3164000	still works
3164000	3165000	and is
3165000	3166000	not
3166000	3167000	affected by
3167000	3168000	order.
3168000	3169000	It just
3169000	3170000	doesn't
3170000	3171000	affect us
3171000	3172000	to read the
3172000	3173000	sentence.
3173000	3174000	This does
3174000	3175000	not mean that
3175000	3176000	the brain will not
3176000	3177000	notice that
3177000	3178000	there is a
3178000	3179000	problem with
3179000	3180000	the
3180000	3181000	order.
3181000	3182000	The
3182000	3183000	question I
3183000	3184000	want to
3184000	3185000	ask is
3185000	3186000	whether it is
3186000	3187000	logical to
3187000	3188000	be
3188000	3189000	educated
3189000	3190000	by
3190000	3191000	grammar
3191000	3192000	and
3192000	3193000	cognitive
3193000	3194000	behavior
3194000	3195000	.
3195000	3196000	This is the
3196000	3197000	first experiment
3197000	3198000	I did as a
3198000	3199000	Ph.D.
3199000	3200000	At first, I
3200000	3201000	couldn't find
3201000	3202000	any results.
3202000	3203000	Then I found
3203000	3204000	that this may be
3204000	3205000	a test of
3205000	3206000	English ability.
3206000	3207000	It is possible
3207000	3208000	that
3208000	3209000	grammar is
3209000	3210000	relatively
3210000	3211000	detailed.
3211000	3212000	You may
3212000	3213000	need a
3213000	3214000	lot of
3214000	3215000	things.
3215000	3216000	For example,
3216000	3217000	you may need
3217000	3218000	native speakers
3218000	3219000	to be able to
3219000	3220000	distinguish the
3220000	3221000	correct words
3221000	3222000	from the
3222000	3223000	wrong words
3223000	3224000	.
3224000	3225000	Although I
3225000	3226000	didn't do a
3226000	3227000	formal test,
3227000	3228000	I agree that
3228000	3229000	the degree of
3229000	3230000	familiarity with
3230000	3231000	this language
3231000	3232000	or the
3232000	3233000	degree of
3233000	3234000	education in
3234000	3235000	this language
3235000	3236000	may greatly
3236000	3237000	affect the
3237000	3238000	results of
3238000	3239000	this experiment
3239000	3240000	.
3240000	3241000	In other words,
3241000	3242000	the interpretation
3242000	3243000	of
3243000	3244000	Yan Yong
3244000	3245000	is right.
3245000	3246000	After long
3246000	3247000	training,
3247000	3248000	you know
3248000	3249000	what is
3249000	3250000	legally
3250000	3251000	reasonable and
3251000	3252000	what is
3252000	3253000	not
3253000	3254000	.
3254000	3255000	This is
3255000	3256000	a bit
3256000	3257000	complicated
3257000	3258000	because
3258000	3259000	everyone will
3259000	3260000	discuss what
3260000	3261000	can enter
3261000	3262000	the unconscious
3262000	3263000	from the
3263000	3264000	conscious.
3264000	3265000	A common
3265000	3266000	example is
3266000	3267000	driving.
3267000	3268000	When you
3268000	3269000	drive for the
3269000	3270000	first time,
3270000	3271000	everything is
3271000	3272000	very conscious
3272000	3273000	because you
3273000	3274000	have to pay
3274000	3275000	attention to
3275000	3276000	what you
3276000	3277000	should
3277000	3278000	step on
3278000	3279000	.
3279000	3280000	After
3280000	3281000	training,
3281000	3282000	the degree of
3282000	3283000	familiarity will
3283000	3284000	allow something
3284000	3285000	that was
3285000	3286000	supposed to be
3286000	3287000	conscious to
3287000	3288000	enter the
3288000	3289000	unconscious process
3289000	3290000	.
3290000	3291000	In my
3291000	3292000	imagination,
3292000	3293000	this experiment
3293000	3294000	is actually
3294000	3295000	a bit
3295000	3296000	similar to
3296000	3297000	that process
3297000	3298000	.
3298000	3299000	I have
3299000	3300000	finished
3300000	3301000	answering
3301000	3302000	.
3302000	3303000	I am going
3303000	3304000	to
3304000	3305000	enter the
3305000	3306000	last stage
3306000	3307000	of
3307000	3308000	today.
3308000	3309000	Before
3309000	3310000	that,
3310000	3311000	I hope I have
3311000	3312000	convinced you that
3312000	3313000	the attraction of the
3313000	3314000	face and the
3314000	3315000	processing of the
3315000	3316000	sentence
3316000	3317000	can be
3317000	3318000	processed
3318000	3319000	when you do
3319000	3320000	not see the
3320000	3321000	key material
3321000	3322000	, which is
3322000	3323000	the face
3323000	3324000	or the
3324000	3325000	character.
3325000	3326000	In fact,
3326000	3327000	we do more than
3327000	3328000	this.
3328000	3329000	We also
3329000	3330000	do, for
3330000	3331000	example,
3331000	3332000	the integration
3332000	3333000	between
3333000	3334000	vision and
3334000	3335000	hearing,
3335000	3336000	or the
3336000	3337000	processing of
3337000	3338000	meaning,
3338000	3339000	which is
3339000	3340000	the
3340000	3341000	processing of
3341000	3342000	meaning.
3342000	3343000	We also
3343000	3344000	found that
3344000	3345000	if you see
3345000	3346000	something you can't
3346000	3347000	see,
3347000	3348000	its reaction
3348000	3349000	is different from
3349000	3350000	the reaction
3350000	3351000	you want to
3351000	3352000	do next.
3352000	3353000	It will
3353000	3354000	interfere with
3354000	3355000	your next
3355000	3356000	reaction.
3356000	3357000	Most of
3357000	3358000	these are
3358000	3359000	visual messages.
3359000	3360000	Many visual
3360000	3361000	messages
3361000	3362000	can still
3362000	3363000	be processed
3363000	3364000	by your
3364000	3365000	brain
3365000	3366000	even if
3366000	3367000	you do
3367000	3368000	not see
3368000	3369000	them.
3369000	3370000	These results
3370000	3371000	show that
3371000	3372000	even if
3372000	3373000	your brain
3373000	3374000	does not
3374000	3375000	see them,
3375000	3376000	some messages
3376000	3377000	can be
3377000	3378000	processed by
3378000	3379000	your visual
3379000	3380000	system.
3380000	3381000	With these
3381000	3382000	results,
3382000	3383000	the next
3383000	3384000	reasonable question
3384000	3385000	is why
3385000	3386000	our brain
3386000	3387000	should not
3387000	3388000	be like a
3388000	3389000	computer
