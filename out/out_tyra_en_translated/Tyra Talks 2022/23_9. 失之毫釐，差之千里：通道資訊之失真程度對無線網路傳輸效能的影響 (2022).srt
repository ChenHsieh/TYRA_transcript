00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I am Jason, and I am the host of Taira Talk. Welcome everyone to Taira Talk on April 19th.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The speaker we invited today is Dr. Zhan Yaojia.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He is currently a PhD candidate at UC Irvine.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,000
His main work is in telecommunications and network information information theory.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He used to study and work at NTU Electronics and Telecommunications.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He is now a PhD student at UC Irvine, and will study abroad under the auspices of the Ministry of Education.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The topic of his talk today is

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The impact of information technology on wireless network transmission.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's give the speaker a round of applause.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's give the floor to Yaojia.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can you hear me?

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, let's get started.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In fact, this is channel information.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Channel information refers to wireless transmission.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I know in advance that the transmission is good or bad,

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
or if I can even quantify it,

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can make some configurations in advance in the transmission section.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This will further improve the efficiency of my transmission.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But if today's information is not so accurate,

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
what impact will it have on my transmission efficiency?

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I hope I can get to this point.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I know some people today,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and they may all have a background in telecommunications.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But most of them are not our peers,

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so I'll see how much I can say.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, good.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Today I will mainly talk about these three parts.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first part is that I will first review

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
how we do information transmission

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
when we are in the so-called traffic jam.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Of course, we have some basic restrictions.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For example, I hope that the higher the efficiency of my transmission,

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the faster the speed,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but at the same time I can't let the transmission go wrong.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So what should I do?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In fact, in 1948,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Claude Shannon had already answered this question.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He had some good results,

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
which we will introduce.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The second part is that I will briefly introduce

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
some simple networks,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
such as broadcast networks,

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
such as interference networks,

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and interference channels.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They have some current solutions

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
for this kind of transmission problem,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and some problems have been solved,

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and some problems have not been solved.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Then, in the absence of a solution,

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how do I deal with it?

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How do I get around with it?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The last part is actually more like my research.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If today I don't know

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
how these channels and links in the middle

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
are,

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the detailed information

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
will not have any fundamental impact on my transmission.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's the first part.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In fact, basically,

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
when we communicate,

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the channels are always noisy,

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
they are always affected or interfered with by the transmission.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's the same with wired communication,

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and it's the same with wireless communication,

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and the environment of wireless communication is more complicated.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because of the so-called multipath effect,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the signal is distorted.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In addition to noise,

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
there is also distortion,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which means that at certain moments,

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
at certain times,

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the intensity of my signal is actually very low.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's not discuss this complicated situation today.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's continue to discuss the above situation.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That is, in wired communication,

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the signal is affected by noise.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When I receive this information,

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it is inevitable that there will be errors,

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and the information will be wrongly decrypted.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Common models,

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
common models for analysis,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
include...

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wait a minute.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Common models for analysis,

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
there are the following two.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The first one is AWGN channel,

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Additive Wide Gaussian Noise channel.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Basically, what it says is that

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I input x1, x2 to xn.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The output I receive is y1, y2 to yn.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The output is what I send,

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
plus a random variable with a common distribution.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This random variable is a mutation.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But in fact, this problem is still very complicated.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We have made the problem so simple.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In fact, it is still very complicated.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So we will further consider

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
a simpler binary symmetric channel.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It only says that

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the input today is x1 to xn.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
At the receiving end,

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
we receive y1 to yn.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then we limit x1.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Every x, every y,

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is only 0 or 1.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What about the middle channel?

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How does the middle channel

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
change these x and x?

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For example, after sending in x1,

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
suppose it is 0,

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
then it has a certain probability

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that p is converted to 1.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If it is converted to 1 today,

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
then this y1 is 1.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If it has not changed today,

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
then it is still 0.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now the question is,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
now the question is,

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
if I really use this,

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
suppose our channel is simplified like this,

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
only 0 or 1 can be fed in.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But there is a certain probability

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that some input will be flipped,

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
will be changed.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How do I do the transmission?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How do I do the message transmission?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
One way is

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to send 0 or 1 directly.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then I don't do any coding at all.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In this case,

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the error rate is p.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because it has given another x1,

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
its probability of being flipped is p.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So the error rate is p.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is there a better way?

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Of course there is.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We do some basic protection devices,

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
protection architecture.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
For example, when I want to send 0,

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I send it three times.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When I want to send 1,

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I send it three times.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When I receive it,

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
we use the so-called multi-digit method.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The basic high-speed data can be calculated,

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the error rate will be relatively low.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It probably looks like this.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But at the same time,

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
in order to send a bit,

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I used three channels.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So my data rate,

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
that is, the speed of my data transmission

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
will be reduced.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Of course,

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
if I increase my repeated times,

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it will definitely reduce my error rate.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But what is the price?

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The price is that my data rate will be reduced.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And when my channel frequency increases,

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
its data rate will drop to 0.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In fact, this is not the result I want.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because in order to protect it,

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I send it so many times.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As a result, my data rate became low.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then my question is,

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is it possible to maintain the data rate at the same time?

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
For example, the data rate is not 0.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Reduce the error rate?

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then, this is a disaster question.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a problem that everyone can immediately think of.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But the first contribution is that

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I will further analyze this problem.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The first one is

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to further disassemble the question itself.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In the first part,

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we add some conditions.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The first part is that we do not limit

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
coding or decoding.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For x,

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I did not do any calculations for x.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
For y,

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I did not do any calculations for y.

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There is no problem with computing complexity.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No matter if it is NP-complete.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If I have a super-powerful computer,

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it can be instantly calculated.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then, we do not limit the usage of channels.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then,

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
further think about data.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
These data bits can actually be borrowed from a table.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This table is on the right.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It sends these bits,

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
sends these data.

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In fact, what did I send?

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Which message did I send?

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From 1 to M.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So,

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the nature of this problem is to say,

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
for example,

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I want to send the 10th message.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How do I design

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
this method of transmission

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
so that it can be correctly resolved

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
at the receiving end?

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then,

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
next is the rate.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The definition of rate,

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
as I just said,

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is that

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
in the case of so many channels,

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the usage of n channels,

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
how many bits did you send?

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
OK, there are M bits here.

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, in fact,

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you can use log12 as your M to represent it.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, there are a total of log12 bits.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So, you can get a basic,

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
this is the basic,

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
this is the level that high-level math can get.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That is, M can actually be written as 2nR square.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
n is the usage of the channel.

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then,

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
R is the transmission speed.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay,

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so, in fact, we will get used to it in the future.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We are used to using this 2nR square

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to represent the number of messages.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then,

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
it also tells you that

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I want to make the error rate as small as possible.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It can only be said that

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
at the receiving end,

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I sent a message

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
at the transmission end.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
At the receiving end,

237
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will design a decoder.

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The fan of the decoder is to guess.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So,

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
guess which message was sent.

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to,

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
so this error means

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this is my message.

244
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For example, if I send the 10th message,

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you may guess the 10,000th message.

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That is, an error has occurred.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then, we want to make the probability of this event

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
as small as possible.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But,

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I must be,

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
for example,

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the event is set,

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
for example,

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
10 to the 10th square,

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
10 to the 100th square,

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and so on,

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
this kind of probability.

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay,

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
so,

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
now,

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
these restrictions

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
are converted

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
into a transmission structure like this.

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So,

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
there is a message in the lower left corner.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So many.

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Then,

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can,

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for example,

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to send so many bits.

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In fact,

272
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am sending a certain message.

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then,

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
it actually says,

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
OK,

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I should pass this message

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
through a certain method.

278
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
For example,

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
check the table.

280
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We build a

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
code book,

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
code book.

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Each message corresponds

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
to a set of code words.

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then,

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I use the way of checking the table

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to make the message

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
into a code word.

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then,

290
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
send it to this channel.

291
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Some bits are crooked.

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Then,

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
received crooked.

294
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Some of the crooked bits

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
may be flipped.

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then,

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we use the decoder.

298
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When the decoder is set,

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I know,

300
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
everyone knows what the code book looks like.

301
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then,

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we can decode

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the message

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
we really want.

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OK,

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
so,

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
now the question becomes,

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
can we design

309
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
such a coding scheme?

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What is the coding scheme?

311
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It is the code mode.

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Code structure.

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is the code structure?

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It includes

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the code book.

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The encoder is the same as the book.

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It is just a table.

318
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And,

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
my decoder,

320
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
my decoder,

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
my code book requires

322
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
whether it can

323
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
be its

324
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
code rate,

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
its transmission speed,

326
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
whether it is

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
not zero,

328
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or not a very small value.

329
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And,

330
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
my decoding error,

331
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
it can be controlled

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
at a very small value.

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
OK,

334
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
so,

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
this is,

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
so,

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
now,

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
we have formulated

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the problem structure

340
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
like this.

341
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We have

342
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the encoder,

343
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the decoder.

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then,

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
our goal is to

346
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
pass this message

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to the other end.

348
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then,

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
here,

350
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want this mhat,

351
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that is,

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that is,

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the received end

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
guess the m,

355
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
guess the message,

356
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the less chance of error,

357
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the better.

358
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Or,

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
it is in a certain,

360
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the chance of error

361
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is in a certain value

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
below,

363
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
OK.

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then,

365
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
this answer,

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can,

367
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
so,

368
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I just,

369
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have already exploded,

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that is,

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that is,

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
this is actually possible,

373
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
can be done.

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Otherwise,

375
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't go on,

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
right?

377
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't go on.

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then,

379
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
it is,

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
then,

381
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it is with,

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
then,

383
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
this is Shannon's

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
contribution

385
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in 1948,

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
which is

387
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
one of his most

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
famous contributions.

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then,

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
then,

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
he,

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
he,

393
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
he made

394
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a set of

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
coding schemes

396
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
including what codebook

397
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,600
plus the

398
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
processor.

399
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
And then,

400
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
but this m maybe

401
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
big

402
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
let my error rate,

403
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
that is my

404
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
effect,

405
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
that is,

406
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
the error can be

407
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
pulled to what I want

408
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
that,

409
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
that is,

410
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
the level of

411
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
minus 100

412
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
quadrature.

413
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
But,

414
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
if you are

415
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
uh,

416
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
if you shoot

417
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
too quickly

418
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
that legendary speed

419
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
today,

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
too fast,

421
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
too high,

422
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
that

423
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
problem came.

424
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
If you

425
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
today,

426
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
then

427
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
uh,

428
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
the problem

429
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
on the project

430
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
came,

431
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
because

432
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
there may

433
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
be

434
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
you for all

435
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
N,

436
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
for all

437
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
uh,

438
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
no matter

439
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
you look for

440
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
all possible

441
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
ways,

442
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
you can't

443
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
let my

444
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
error rate

445
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
be able to

446
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
drop to

447
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
the level

448
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
you want

449
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
.

450
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
For example,

451
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
if you

452
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
start to

453
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
drop to

454
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
10-100

455
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
quadrature,

456
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
10-6

457
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
quadrature,

458
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
10-7

459
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
quadrature,

460
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
you will find

461
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
that

462
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
you can't

463
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
find it,

464
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
no matter

465
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
how much

466
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
you use,

467
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
you can't

468
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
find this

469
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
coding

470
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
method.

471
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
OK,

472
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
so this is

473
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
that,

474
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
this is called

475
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Noisy Channel

476
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Coding Theorem,

477
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
and then

478
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
we put this

479
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
in our

480
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
code,

481
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
and then

482
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
there are

483
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
any questions

484
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
you can

485
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
ask,

486
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
because

487
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
in fact,

488
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I should be,

489
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
yes,

490
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
it should be

491
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
like the

492
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
host said,

493
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
it's really

494
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
quite mathematical

495
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
here,

496
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
and then

497
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
uh,

498
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I used to

499
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
do is

500
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
more engineering

501
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
problems,

502
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
and then

503
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
turn to

504
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
more theoretical

505
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
problems,

506
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
in fact,

507
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
it was a

508
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
long time

509
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
ago,

510
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
so it's

511
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
completely different,

512
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
it takes some

513
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
time to

514
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
switch,

515
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
OK,

516
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
so here

517
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
is a magical

518
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
number,

519
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
which is

520
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
called

521
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Channel Capacity,

522
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
and then

523
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
it is

524
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
like this,

525
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
this thing,

526
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
what is

527
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
this thing?

528
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
This thing

529
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
actually,

530
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
uh,

531
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
there is also

532
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
a mathematical

533
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
definition,

534
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
it is,

535
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
uh,

536
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
seems to be

537
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
very complicated,

538
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
which is

539
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
the so-called

540
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Entropy,

541
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
if you are

542
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
reading physics,

543
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
you will know

544
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
what is called

545
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Entropy,

546
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
if you are reading

547
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
chemistry,

548
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
you know

549
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
what is

550
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Entropy,

551
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
it basically

552
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
measures

553
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
how messy

554
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
a system

555
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
is,

556
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
but the

557
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Entropy here

558
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
is not the

559
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
same as

560
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
that side,

561
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
the Entropy

562
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
definition here

563
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
is that

564
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
oh,

565
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
if today,

566
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
in fact,

567
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
the probability

568
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
is so much,

569
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
p of x,

570
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
uh,

571
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
px of e,

572
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
then multiply by log,

573
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
there is also

574
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
uh,

575
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
p of x,

576
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
uh,

577
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
p of x,

578
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
1,

579
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
1,

580
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
so much,

581
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
and then

582
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
zero,

583
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
zero in,

584
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
the calculated value

585
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
is the Entropy

586
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
of x,

587
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
the Entropy

588
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
of random variables

589
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
of x.

590
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Okay,

591
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
so what it means

592
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
is actually

593
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
the uncertainty

594
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
of x,

595
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
and then

596
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
the uncertainty

597
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
of random variables

598
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
of x.

599
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Before you do the experiment,

600
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
you don't know

601
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
how much it is,

602
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
but after you do the experiment,

603
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
OK,

604
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
how many bits

605
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
do you need

606
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
to represent

607
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
the result of the experiment?

608
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
OK,

609
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
that is to say,

610
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
uh,

611
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
how many,

612
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
it means that

613
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
you have,

614
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
uh,

615
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
you have,

616
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
uh,

617
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
yeah,

618
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
that's about it,

619
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and then

620
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
it's actually

621
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
listed on the

622
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
internet,

623
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
it's

624
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
19 equations

625
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
for

626
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
the

627
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Entropy

628
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
of information.

629
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
OK,

630
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
so we have this thing,

631
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
we have this,

632
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
after its interpretation,

633
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
the Entropy

634
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
is,

635
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
uh,

636
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
the uncertainty

637
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
of x,

638
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
in terms of bits,

639
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
or we need to know

640
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
the number of x,

641
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
we need to know

642
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
the number of bits.

643
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
So,

644
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
let's see

645
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
what this thing is,

646
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I of x,

647
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
divided by y,

648
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
it,

649
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
uh,

650
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
its name is

651
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Mutual Information.

652
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
It,

653
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
from the second

654
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
interpretation,

655
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
we can see that

656
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
it's actually

657
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
the uncertainty of x

658
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
divided by,

659
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
after giving y,

660
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
how much uncertainty

661
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
does x have left?

662
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
OK,

663
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
so what does it mean?

664
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
It's actually,

665
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
if you know,

666
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
uh,

667
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
in the case of y,

668
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
uh,

669
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
you know in the case of y,

670
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
how many bits

671
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
do you actually have,

672
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
uh,

673
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
you,

674
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
you can know

675
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
how many bits x is.

676
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
So,

677
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
to a certain extent,

678
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
this is actually

679
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
what we want,

680
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
in terms of intuitive meaning,

681
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
it's actually,

682
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
uh,

683
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
how many bits x is.

684
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
So,

685
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
what Mutual Information

686
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
actually gives me is,

687
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
uh,

688
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
x is,

689
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
uh,

690
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
in the case of giving y,

691
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I know

692
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
how many things x has.

693
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I know x's,

694
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
what x's value is,

695
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
in terms of bits,

696
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
like this.

697
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
OK,

698
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
so,

699
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
uh,

700
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
so intuitively speaking,

701
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
this seems to be

702
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
what we want,

703
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
but

704
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
in fact,

705
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
this proof is

706
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
very,

707
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
very difficult.

708
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
And then,

709
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
because of this proof,

710
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
there's a new field called

711
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
telecommunications,

712
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
telecommunications engineering,

713
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
there's a new field called

714
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
news theory.

715
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
So,

716
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
so this proof,

717
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
in fact,

718
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
in our field,

719
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
the proof is divided into two parts.

720
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
The first part is the so-called

721
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
converse part.

722
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
It proves that,

723
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
OK,

724
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
my code,

725
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
my transmission speed is greater than c,

726
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
it's impossible.

727
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
The second part is the

728
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
achievability part,

729
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
which is

730
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
achievability is

731
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
achievable,

732
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
achievable,

733
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
that kind of part.

734
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
So,

735
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
it only says,

736
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
uh,

737
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I,

738
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
I actually have to find a

739
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
way to make

740
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
this code

741
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
pass,

742
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
pass with such a high speed,

743
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
pass with such a high speed,

744
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
pass with such a high speed,

745
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
pass with such a high speed,

746
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
OK.

747
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
pass with such a high speed,

748
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
pass with such a high speed,

749
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
OK.

750
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
OK.

751
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Of course,

752
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
in the process of passing,

753
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
we have to,

754
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
uh,

755
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
we,

756
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
but we have to specify my

757
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
error rate first,

758
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
for example,

759
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
10 to the minus 100 times,

760
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
and then,

761
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
we have to find

762
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
such a coding scheme,

763
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
and then,

764
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
and then,

765
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
of course,

766
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
nk is any nk,

767
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
it may take

768
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
a while,

769
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
OK.

770
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
OK,

771
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
then,

772
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
sorry,

773
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
can I ask a question?

774
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes, please.

775
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
This is,

776
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
uh,

777
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
because I don't understand

778
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
it at all,

779
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
so,

780
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
uh,

781
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
this is,

782
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I want,

783
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
can you give an example?

784
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
For example,

785
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
suppose I know,

786
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
suppose I have a

787
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
method of passing,

788
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
then,

789
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I,

790
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I,

791
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
after I get y,

792
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm totally sure

793
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
how much x is,

794
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
then,

795
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
what would i be?

796
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Would i be 0?

797
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
OK,

798
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
if you know,

799
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
for example,

800
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
like this,

801
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
uh,

802
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
uh,

803
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
if you say you know,

804
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
after you get x,

805
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
you totally know

806
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
how much x is,

807
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
right?

808
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
So,

809
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
my question is,

810
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
you have an ideal channel,

811
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
yes,

812
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
no noise at all,

813
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
yes,

814
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
then,

815
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
after you get y,

816
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
you totally know

817
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
how much x is,

818
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
yes,

819
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
yes,

820
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
then,

821
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
in the following,

822
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
probability should be 0,

823
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
right?

824
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
No,

825
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
no,

826
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
so,

827
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
the x itself,

828
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
the x itself,

829
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
it's,

830
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
OK,

831
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
it means,

832
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
if you use this way,

833
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I can,

834
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I can answer you like this,

835
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
like,

836
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
if you know y,

837
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
then,

838
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
you know x,

839
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
then,

840
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
suppose it's a channel

841
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
with no noise,

842
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
x is actually,

843
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
you know y,

844
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
you know x,

845
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
so,

846
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
you know the uncertainty of x,

847
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
after you know y,

848
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
the uncertainty of x is 0,

849
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
so,

850
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
this one is 0,

851
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
so,

852
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
this mutual information,

853
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
mutual information

854
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
is equal to

855
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
x's,

856
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
like,

857
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
you can think about

858
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
how many bits x has,

859
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
for example,

860
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
if you use this formula

861
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
to measure,

862
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
for example,

863
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
the way you code is

864
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
using,

865
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
for example,

866
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
50% chance is 1,

867
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
50% chance is 0,

868
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
then,

869
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
in this way,

870
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
if you can,

871
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
you put this,

872
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
this,

873
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
for example,

874
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
you take this data

875
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
to calculate

876
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
h of x,

877
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
the answer will be 1,

878
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
OK,

879
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
what does it mean?

880
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
What does it mean?

881
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
So,

882
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
p is 1 in 2,

883
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
right?

884
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
p is 1,

885
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
right?

886
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
OK,

887
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
2 is 1,

888
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
then,

889
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
log is 1 in 2,

890
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
1 in 1 in 2 is 1,

891
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
this value is 1,

892
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
so,

893
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
there are two 1 in 2,

894
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
right?

895
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
OK,

896
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
so,

897
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
adding up is 1,

898
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
OK,

899
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
so,

900
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
this value,

901
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
i,

902
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
this mutual information,

903
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
mutual information is 1,

904
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
what does it mean?

905
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
It means that

906
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
my transmission speed

907
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
can be 1,

908
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
1 bit per channel use,

909
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
OK,

910
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
so,

911
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
channel capacity will be 1,

912
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
right,

913
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
OK,

914
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
right,

915
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
and you can easily

916
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
prove this thing,

917
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
why?

918
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Because the channel is noise,

919
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
so,

920
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
no matter what you send,

921
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
it will receive,

922
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
it should be said that

923
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
what I received

924
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
is exactly the same as what I send,

925
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
right?

926
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Then it means that

927
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
there is no channel,

928
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I will directly go to

929
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
take my,

930
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I know this,

931
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
OK,

932
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
this base case,

933
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I understand now,

934
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
OK,

935
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
right,

936
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
OK,

937
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
then,

938
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I should give a,

939
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I actually wrote an example

940
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
in my lecture,

941
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
but I forgot to say,

942
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I want to clarify,

943
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
that is,

944
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
that is,

945
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
the example just now

946
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
is not to say,

947
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
how to say,

948
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
in the case of noiseless,

949
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
mutual information

950
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
is always 1,

951
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
the example just now

952
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
is 1,

953
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
OK,

954
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
this is related to

955
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
your encoding method,

956
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
right?

957
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Right,

958
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
OK,

959
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
OK,

960
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
so,

961
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
in my X,

962
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
for example,

963
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
if today

964
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
my X

965
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
is 10%,

966
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
for example,

967
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
like,

968
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
another example,

969
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
suppose my X,

970
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
encoding method

971
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
100% is 1,

972
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
0% is

973
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
0,

974
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
that means

975
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
everything I send

976
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
is all 1,

977
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
right?

978
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Right,

979
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
right,

980
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
that's right,

981
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
right,

982
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
this is another extreme example,

983
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
then,

984
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
in this case,

985
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
you can figure out that

986
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
entropy is actually 0,

987
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
right,

988
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
because 1 times

989
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
so you didn't

990
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
send any information

991
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
out,

992
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
right,

993
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
that's right,

994
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
then this

995
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
is 0,

996
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
so,

997
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
so that means,

998
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
OK,

999
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
you want to

1000
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
say,

1001
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
OK,

1002
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
OK,

1003
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
OK,

1004
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
OK,

1005
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
OK,

1006
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
OK,

1007
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
OK,

1008
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
OK,

1009
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
OK,

1010
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
OK,

1011
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
OK,

1012
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
OK,

1013
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
OK,

1014
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
OK,

1015
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
OK,

1016
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
OK,

1017
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
OK,

1018
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
OK,

1019
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
OK,

1020
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
so,

1021
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
the next thing

1022
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
we have to ask is,

1023
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
how do I

1024
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
get to this thing?

1025
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Because I'm

1026
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
always at this thing,

1027
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
actually,

1028
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
because,

1029
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
how do I get to this thing?

1030
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
He said,

1031
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I can use

1032
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
such a fast speed

1033
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
to code,

1034
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
to pass information.

1035
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
So,

1036
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
how do I actually do this thing?

1037
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
So,

1038
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm trying to use

1039
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
some examples

1040
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
to talk about this.

1041
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Because his,

1042
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
let's see,

1043
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
let's see if

1044
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I can finish

1045
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
in a short time,

1046
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
to make it clear,

1047
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
like this.

1048
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
OK,

1049
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
so,

1050
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
what is the current goal?

1051
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm going to find a codebook.

1052
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
And then,

1053
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
his,

1054
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
his,

1055
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
his,

1056
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
the speed of coding

1057
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
is,

1058
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
or his speed of transmission

1059
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
is very close to

1060
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
his dc.

1061
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
And then,

1062
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
there is a decoder.

1063
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
He is a decoder.

1064
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
OK,

1065
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
so he's looking for these two things.

1066
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Let's assume

1067
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
my input is,

1068
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
this is 0,

1069
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
input,

1070
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
x,

1071
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
x1 is

1072
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
0.5 when it is equal to 1,

1073
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
0.5 when it is equal to 0.

1074
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
And then,

1075
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
the channel,

1076
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
this channel,

1077
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
the probability of flipping is 0.1.

1078
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
That is,

1079
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
if I enter 0 here,

1080
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
10% of the probability

1081
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
will be turned into 1,

1082
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
90% of the probability,

1083
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
90% of the probability

1084
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
will still remain the same,

1085
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
like this.

1086
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
OK,

1087
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
OK,

1088
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
OK,

1089
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
so,

1090
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
in fact,

1091
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
how do they think about this problem?

1092
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
He actually wants to say,

1093
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
OK,

1094
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
then I just randomly generate

1095
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
that,

1096
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I have a random number generator,

1097
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I just randomly generate

1098
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
0 and 1,

1099
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
a total of n.

1100
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Then,

1101
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I use this,

1102
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
these points mean that

1103
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
there is a set of results.

1104
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Then,

1105
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I use this big circle

1106
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
to represent

1107
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
all possible situations.

1108
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
So,

1109
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
these points

1110
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
are actually

1111
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
just a few,

1112
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
just a few examples.

1113
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
OK,

1114
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
according to the rule of large numbers,

1115
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I use

1116
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
the probability

1117
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
XR,

1118
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
its probability of

1119
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
1 is 0.5,

1120
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
the probability of 0

1121
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
is also 0.5.

1122
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
So,

1123
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
what does it mean?

1124
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I can find some,

1125
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
OK,

1126
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
I can find some,

1127
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
for example,

1128
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
this red dot,

1129
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I can find some codes,

1130
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
it is about 50%

1131
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
of the composition,

1132
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
about half is 1,

1133
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
half is,

1134
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
the other half is 0,

1135
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
like the red code

1136
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
is like this.

1137
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
The green code is also like this,

1138
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
that is,

1139
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
the front half is 1,

1140
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
the back half is 0,

1141
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
like this green one

1142
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
is the same,

1143
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
the front half is 0,

1144
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
the back half is 1,

1145
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
OK,

1146
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
the rule of large numbers

1147
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
tells us that

1148
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
I randomly generate

1149
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
a set of code words,

1150
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
it will fall into

1151
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
this blue set,

1152
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
we call this

1153
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
typical set,

1154
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
it will fall into this set,

1155
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
the probability of it is 1.

1156
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Why?

1157
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
For example,

1158
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
like this,

1159
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
for example,

1160
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
like this,

1161
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
all of them are

1162
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
1.

1163
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
OK,

1164
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
if today,

1165
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
although,

1166
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
all of them are 1.

1167
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
OK,

1168
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
then,

1169
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
this situation

1170
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
is very unlikely to happen,

1171
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
right?

1172
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Right?

1173
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
According to the rule of large numbers,

1174
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
it,

1175
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
you have to generate all of it,

1176
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
you have to throw the copper plate,

1177
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
throw it 10,000 times in a row,

1178
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
it's all positive,

1179
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
basically 0.

1180
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
If all of them

1181
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
are all 0,

1182
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
there is a chance of the opposite,

1183
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
it's all close to 0.

1184
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
So,

1185
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
only in,

1186
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
so,

1187
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
this thing

1188
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
will not fall into

1189
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
this blue area,

1190
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
this blue area

1191
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
is the collection of all

1192
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
that,

1193
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
54% is 1,

1194
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
54% is 0,

1195
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
all the sequences,

1196
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
all of that,

1197
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
the code word,

1198
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
like this.

1199
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
OK,

1200
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
if I choose a red code word today,

1201
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
and then take it,

1202
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
let it pass,

1203
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
what will happen to me?

1204
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
What is this channel

1205
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
actually doing?

1206
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Is to take these

1207
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
101010,

1208
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
and then,

1209
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I go,

1210
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
when passing through the channel,

1211
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
these 10 will be

1212
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
the most random flip,

1213
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
some may not change,

1214
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
some may flip.

1215
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
That,

1216
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
there is about 10%,

1217
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
about 10% of the,

1218
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
10% of the bit

1219
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
may be flipped,

1220
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
90% of the chance will not,

1221
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
90% of the bit

1222
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
will not be flipped,

1223
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
because this is

1224
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
a channel feature.

1225
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
OK,

1226
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
what does it mean

1227
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
in math?

1228
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
In fact,

1229
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I am the original thing,

1230
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
plus a sequence,

1231
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
that is,

1232
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
I just add

1233
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
component y,

1234
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
and then,

1235
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
what is this zn?

1236
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
This zn is actually

1237
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
10% is 1,

1238
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
90% is 0.

1239
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
OK,

1240
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
and then,

1241
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
that,

1242
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
that is also very likely,

1243
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
that is also,

1244
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
according to the rule of thumb,

1245
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
this is also very likely,

1246
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
this is very likely

1247
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
to happen,

1248
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
and the probability of happening

1249
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
is very close to 1.

1250
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
OK,

1251
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
what will happen?

1252
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
What will happen?

1253
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
It will be found that

1254
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
my red,

1255
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
after going through

1256
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
my own disturbance,

1257
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
it may be

1258
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
this red,

1259
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
in the small circle,

1260
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
any of the red points.

1261
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
OK,

1262
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
then we put

1263
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
this kind of thing,

1264
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
every point is actually

1265
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
a sequence,

1266
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
n,

1267
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
the length is n sequence,

1268
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
0, 1 sequence.

1269
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
That,

1270
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
specifically,

1271
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
which,

1272
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
which is flipped,

1273
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
in fact,

1274
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
we do not know,

1275
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
we put it all

1276
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
in here.

1277
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
That,

1278
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I pass

1279
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
101010

1280
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
the situation,

1281
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I received the y,

1282
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
uh,

1283
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
what is it,

1284
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
like this,

1285
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
and then,

1286
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
what is it,

1287
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
it is 101010

1288
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
plus that,

1289
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
all possible,

1290
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
all,

1291
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
uh,

1292
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
the probability of occurrence is very high,

1293
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
the result of the disturbance,

1294
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
for example,

1295
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
there are

1296
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
the first 10% is 1,

1297
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
the rest is 0,

1298
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
then we put it

1299
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
in this,

1300
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
this collection.

1301
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Then,

1302
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
this,

1303
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
then,

1304
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
this red dot is,

1305
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
for example,

1306
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
101010

1307
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
plus,

1308
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
the first 10% is 1,

1309
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
the rest is 0,

1310
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
the result,

1311
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
like this.

1312
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
OK,

1313
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
the same,

1314
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
the same thing,

1315
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
that,

1316
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
these things are all very likely to happen,

1317
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
because according to the law of magnitude,

1318
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
that,

1319
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
the same truth,

1320
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
we can,

1321
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
what,

1322
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
we can,

1323
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
uh,

1324
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
we can see that,

1325
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
OK,

1326
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
in fact,

1327
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
uh,

1328
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
you just said that the small circle,

1329
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
in fact,

1330
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
in the red circle,

1331
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
the red circle,

1332
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
it itself also has that,

1333
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
that,

1334
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
it itself is channel output,

1335
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
that is,

1336
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
its so-called typical set.

1337
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
We can figure out that,

1338
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
OK,

1339
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Y actually has 51%,

1340
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
50% is 0,

1341
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
then we collect those,

1342
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
half is 1,

1343
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
half is 0,

1344
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
those sequences,

1345
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
we collect them in here.

1346
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Then,

1347
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
we put these green dots,

1348
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
this green dot,

1349
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
this green dot,

1350
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
this green dot,

1351
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
this green dot,

1352
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
these four green dots,

1353
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
through this way of passing,

1354
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
we can receive these,

1355
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
uh,

1356
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
for example,

1357
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
the green dot on the far left,

1358
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
what it receives is,

1359
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
it may be,

1360
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
this green small circle inside,

1361
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
the top one,

1362
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
what it receives is this,

1363
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
the right one,

1364
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
the bottom one,

1365
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
is the one at the bottom.

1366
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
OK.

1367
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Good.

1368
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Then,

1369
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm going to design this decoder.

1370
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Of course,

1371
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
you can observe that,

1372
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
if the dots I choose today,

1373
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
are very few,

1374
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
for example,

1375
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
I only choose these five dots,

1376
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
then in fact,

1377
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
after it is printed,

1378
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I see on the Y,

1379
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I see on the Y,

1380
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
that they may not

1381
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
overlap,

1382
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
that they may not overlap,

1383
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
they are all independent,

1384
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
they are all disjoint.

1385
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
they are all independent,

1386
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
they are all disjoint.

1387
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
So,

1388
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
what does it mean?

1389
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
As long as its red dot

1390
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
appears in the red area,

1391
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
appears in the red area,

1392
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
we can see that

1393
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Ah,

1394
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
it wears this.

1395
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
The green on the left,

1396
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
if it's sent here,

1397
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
the green on the left,

1398
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
We tell directly that

1399
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
it wears this?

1400
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
OK.

1401
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Therefore,

1402
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
we can design the decoder.

1403
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Then,

1404
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I am going to see

1405
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I am going to design the decoder.

1406
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Then,

1407
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm going to see

1408
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
this Y,

1409
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
or the Sequence

1410
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
that is received by me

1411
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
or security

1412
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
or security

1413
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
into this compound.

1414
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
If it's in this set,

1415
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
if it's in this set,

1416
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I will decode the Y

1417
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
into the corresponding X.

1418
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
into the corresponding X.

1419
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
For example,

1420
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
if Y is in red,

1421
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I will decode it into red.

1422
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
If Y is in the upper left corner,

1423
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I will decode it into the upper left corner.

1424
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I will decode it into the upper left corner.

1425
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
OK.

1426
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
OK.

1427
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
This is the most mathematical part.

1428
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
This is the most mathematical part

1429
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
of the whole decoding.

1430
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
We can calculate

1431
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
how many

1432
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,600
how many

1433
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
how many

1434
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
OK.

1435
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
I should say like this.

1436
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
OK.

1437
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
This is the design of the decoder.

1438
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I just said that

1439
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
if they don't overlap

1440
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
these small groups

1441
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
or circles,

1442
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
then

1443
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
I can successfully decode

1444
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
and there is no error, right?

1445
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Or the error rate

1446
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
I can say that

1447
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I have no error.

1448
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
But if today

1449
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
there is a little

1450
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
allow a little overlap,

1451
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
then we can

1452
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
let the error rate

1453
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
let the error rate

1454
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
control the threshold

1455
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
control the threshold

1456
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
that we want

1457
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
10 to the negative 6th square

1458
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
10 to the negative 100th square.

1459
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
OK.

1460
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Today

1461
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Now the problem is that

1462
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
OK.

1463
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
We can't choose too many

1464
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
OK.

1465
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
We can't choose too many

1466
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
these points.

1467
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
For example, we just chose 5 points.

1468
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
It has made this

1469
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
red inside

1470
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
so many crowded

1471
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
small circles.

1472
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
If we choose

1473
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
a few more,

1474
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
then these small circles

1475
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
will actually overlap.

1476
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
As long as there is a large

1477
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
large-scale overlap

1478
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
large-scale overlap

1479
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
large-scale overlap

1480
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
large-scale overlap

1481
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
the error rate

1482
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
and the error rate

1483
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
is still very high.

1484
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
OK.

1485
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
We try to avoid

1486
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
this situation.

1487
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
So how do we see it?

1488
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Let's see

1489
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
OK.

1490
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Let's see

1491
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
in this blue circle

1492
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
how many

1493
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
how many

1494
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
how many

1495
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
how many

1496
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
code words are in it.

1497
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Then we put this

1498
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
blue circle

1499
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
called TX

1500
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
like this.

1501
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
OK.

1502
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
TX

1503
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Then we use a bar

1504
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
to represent its

1505
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
absolute value

1506
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
to represent its number.

1507
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Then you can calculate

1508
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
its number

1509
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
is actually about

1510
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
X

1511
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
is the entropy of X.

1512
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Then its detailed introduction

1513
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
is

1514
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
is actually very simple.

1515
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
You just think about

1516
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
how do I

1517
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
if I randomly generate code words

1518
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
how do I get

1519
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
the red one?

1520
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Then the probability of it being calculated

1521
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
is about this much.

1522
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
This is high school math

1523
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
can be calculated.

1524
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Then

1525
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
through the conversion of high school math

1526
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
put this

1527
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
TX

1528
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
on the square

1529
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
you can calculate

1530
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
OK.

1531
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
It actually draws

1532
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
a red circle

1533
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
the probability of a red circle

1534
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
is 2 to the negative n

1535
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
X

1536
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
negative

1537
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
negative

1538
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
negative

1539
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
OK.

1540
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
But

1541
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
the probability of a blue circle

1542
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
is 1.

1543
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
So

1544
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
if you collect

1545
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
all these points

1546
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
the probability of it being added

1547
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
will be 1.

1548
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
So

1549
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
roughly

1550
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
in this circle

1551
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
there are so many

1552
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
so many

1553
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
so many

1554
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
so many

1555
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
so many

1556
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
so many

1557
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
so many

1558
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
so many

1559
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
so many

1560
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
so many

1561
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
so many

1562
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
so many

1563
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
so many

1564
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
so many

1565
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
so many

1566
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
so many

1567
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
so many

1568
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
so many

1569
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
so many

1570
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
so many

1571
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
so many

1572
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
so many

1573
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
so many

1574
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
so many

1575
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
so many

1576
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
so many

1577
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
so many

1578
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
so many

1579
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
so many

1580
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
so many

1581
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
red circles

1582
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
OK.

1583
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
So

1584
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
now

1585
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
my goal is

1586
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
to not to

1587
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
let these

1588
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
rising circles overlap

1589
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
so

1590
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
that

1591
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
I can

1592
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
can

1593
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
can

1594
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
can

1595
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
can

1596
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
let these two

1597
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
come in

1598
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
which is

1599
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
h of

1600
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
entropy of y

1601
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
minus entropy of y given x

1602
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
so

1603
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
by definition

1604
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
this thing

1605
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
my R

1606
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
is

1607
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
less than

1608
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
or equal to

1609
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
the mutual information

1610
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
of x and y

1611
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
like this

1612
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
OK.

1613
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Of course we can

1614
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
improve

1615
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
but it's just

1616
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
a loose statement

1617
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
we can

1618
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
improve

1619
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
to prove

1620
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
that

1621
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
this

1622
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
this

1623
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
way of

1624
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
decoding

1625
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
can be

1626
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
as small as

1627
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
we want

1628
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
OK.

1629
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
OK.

1630
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
So

1631
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
OK.

1632
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
So

1633
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
is this

1634
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
the most mathematical part

1635
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
of the whole talk

1636
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
and

1637
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
then

1638
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
then

1639
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I don't know

1640
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
if there is any

1641
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
question

1642
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
here

1643
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
OK.

1644
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
OK.

1645
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
OK.

1646
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
OK.

1647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
OK.

1648
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
OK.

1649
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
OK.

1650
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
OK.

1651
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
OK.

1652
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
OK.

1653
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
OK.

1654
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
