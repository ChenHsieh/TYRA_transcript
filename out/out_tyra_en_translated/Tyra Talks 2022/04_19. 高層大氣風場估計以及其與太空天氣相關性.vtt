Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk. Taira is an event for young researchers in Taiwan. We hold some Taira Talks every week all year round, which includes everything from liberal arts to science, engineering, biology, medicine, etc.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
If you would like to share your research in the future, please feel free to sign up.

00:29.000 --> 00:42.000
Today's speaker is Lian Chuan-Ping, and his topic is the relationship between high-level atmospheric wind turbines and their relationship with space weather.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
Lian Chuan-Ping is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace and Space Sciences at Colorado University.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
His field of research is data synchronization, electromagnetic transfer, and solar eclipses.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
In addition to his research, he also enjoys hiking, jogging, and watching movies at home.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll hand over to Chuan-Ping.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Hello everyone, I'm Lian Chuan-Ping.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
Today's speaker's topic is the relationship between high-level atmospheric wind turbines and their relationship with space weather.

01:23.000 --> 01:36.000
Today, I will focus on the reason why we want to conduct high-level atmospheric wind turbines.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
First of all, this is my background.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
My major focus is on space weather forecast.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
The method I use is data synchronization.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
The solar weather we are targeting is the daily change of the electromagnetic force of the Earth's magnetic field.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
We can understand it as a type of space weather.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Later, I will introduce in detail what type of space weather it is.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
This is our main topic for today.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
First, we will introduce what space weather is and its definition.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Then, we will talk about what type of space weather we want to forecast,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
why we want to forecast this system, and how to forecast it.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Finally, we will talk about the difficulties and challenges we encounter.

02:30.000 --> 02:41.000
These are the reasons why we conduct high-level atmospheric wind turbines.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
First, what is space weather?

02:46.000 --> 02:58.000
Space weather refers to the daily change of the interaction between the matter in space and the atmosphere on Earth.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Basically, we can understand it as the so-called weather.

03:02.000 --> 03:13.000
In this study, we focus on the low-middle latitude electromagnetic layer of the Earth.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
Its height is approximately at the boundary of the Earth's high-level atmosphere and space.

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
In order to forecast this system, we must first understand the composition of the high-level atmosphere.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
This graph shows the height of the Earth's surface.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
The middle axis is the height, and the horizontal axis is the density of gas particles.

03:43.000 --> 03:54.000
The blue and black lines indicate the change of electromagnetic particles in height.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
The orange line is the so-called middle atmosphere.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.000
For example, it may be the part of oxygen molecules, nitrogen molecules, or oxygen atoms.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
We can clearly see in this graph that the density of the middle atmosphere is much higher than the so-called electromagnetic density.

04:15.000 --> 04:26.000
And the higher the number is, we can see that the horizontal axis is a difference of tens of times or more than tens of times or more than tens of times.

04:27.000 --> 04:38.000
In such a high-level atmosphere, the electromagnetic layer is not very uniform.

04:38.000 --> 04:51.000
We can observe the so-called electromagnetic irregularity, or the phenomenon of an equatorial plasma bubble.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
This is one of the types of space weather we want to forecast.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
The graph on the left is a wet map, and the red part represents the more electromagnetic density.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
The blue part represents an area with relatively less electromagnetic density.

05:08.000 --> 05:24.000
The graph on the right is a high-level area of about 200 to 400 kilometers.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
This is a high-level area.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
As for its three-dimensional structure, we can see that the graph on the left is a simulation of an electromagnetic bubble.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
The three axes on the left are the height, the diameter, and the latitude.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
The yellow part represents an area with relatively more electromagnetic density.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
The blue part represents an area with relatively less electromagnetic density.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
The so-called electromagnetic bubble develops along a cone-shaped area.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
The cone-shaped area is the magnetic field of the Earth's magnetic field.

06:10.000 --> 06:24.000
If we cut down from the magnetic field of the Earth, we can see that the so-called electromagnetic bubble is a high-level area that looks like a bubble.

06:24.000 --> 06:38.000
If we look down from space, we will find that the area with relatively less electromagnetic density is a cone-shaped area.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
This is an actual observation.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
The time period is November and December 2019.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
The red area represents an area with relatively more electromagnetic density.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
The so-called dark area is the area where the electromagnetic bubble occurs.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
The interesting thing is that it sometimes occurs and sometimes does not occur.

07:11.000 --> 07:21.000
The video on the right shows the so-called electromagnetic bubble change every day.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
We can understand it as the so-called space weather.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
We can see that this dark area sometimes does not occur and sometimes does occur.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Why do we want to forecast it?

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
The main reason is that the U.S. government has proposed a policy related to space weather preparation.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
It was released in 2015 and was updated in 2019.

07:49.000 --> 07:59.000
Because of this policy, the U.S. military began to focus on space weather forecasts and space weather-related research.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
One of the reasons is that the military relies on the wireless communications system.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
When we just mentioned the irregularity of the power line or the electromagnetic bubble, the signal will be reduced or flashed.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
This is why we want to carry out space weather forecasts.

08:21.000 --> 08:35.000
In addition to the observations we just mentioned, we can also use the Formosa Satellite-7 satellite that Taiwan and the United States have cooperated with to observe the electromagnetic bubble.

08:35.000 --> 08:50.000
This satellite has several satellites, so it can carry out a relatively wide coverage rate in space to observe the electromagnetic bubble.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Each satellite is equipped with a global navigation satellite system receiver.

08:58.000 --> 09:11.000
This satellite can receive signals from GPS or GNSS global satellite systems.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
We all know that when a radio wave or light passes through an interface, it creates a distortion phenomenon.

09:17.000 --> 09:32.000
The so-called radio occupation observation is to use this principle to carry out a high-level observation of the power line to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
The image on the right shows a relatively high-level global navigation satellite system receiver.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
When the radio wave or light passes through an interface, it creates a distortion phenomenon.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
We use this distortion phenomenon to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.

09:58.000 --> 10:09.000
The image on the left shows the so-called high-level distortion phenomenon mentioned in this study.

10:09.000 --> 10:23.000
The so-called high-level distortion phenomenon is to use this principle to carry out a high-level observation of the power line to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
Usually, we assume that the location of such an interface is on the line of the electric wave and the curve of the ball.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
We use this principle to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble or the irregularity of the electromagnetic layer.

10:38.000 --> 10:54.000
Next, we need to think about how to predict the system and the characteristics of the system.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
When we predict a system, the most important thing is the so-called error.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
We want to use error or probability to express the reliability of our prediction.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
But we don't want this error to be too big or too small.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
We want this error to be in a more moderate range.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
It can change at any time, but we basically don't want it to happen on the right.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
One of the phenomena is that you can see the error.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
The width represents the error.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
We don't want this error to spread more and more to a situation of infinite magnitude.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
Or we don't want this error to get closer and closer to a fixed value as time goes by.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
This is easy to understand.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
For example, the following situation.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
If the error is getting smaller and smaller as time goes by, we don't have to predict it.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Because it will become a fixed value.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
So we don't have to predict the necessity of such a system.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
In short, we want the system we want to predict.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
The error will not be too big or too small as time goes by.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Then we think about how to predict.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.000
In our research, the method we use is the so-called data assimilation.

12:27.000 --> 12:37.000
It uses statistics to combine observation and prediction to produce a initial condition.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Then the initial condition is digitally simulated to achieve the purpose of prediction.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
Specifically, how do we use statistics to combine observation and prediction?

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
Specifically, we use Bayes' theorem to update our error.

12:58.000 --> 13:08.000
The figure on the left shows what we will get after updating with Bayes' theorem.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
The horizontal axis is the temperature and the vertical axis is the probability density.

13:13.000 --> 13:35.000
We can see that the probability density function we provided at the beginning is relatively accurate after observation update.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
In terms of probability, it is a relatively narrow probability distribution.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
Through Bayes' theorem, we update such a probability density function.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
We can get a more accurate and realistic probability density function.

13:51.000 --> 14:01.000
The result shown is that we will get a relatively high probability density function.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
The next thing we want to think about is how to predict.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Since we have updated our probability density function through observation,

14:15.000 --> 14:25.000
How do we get the next time probability density function?

14:26.000 --> 14:43.000
We basically use the probability density function we just got to sample the probability density function.

14:43.000 --> 15:03.000
Then we do several digital simulations to achieve the purpose of prediction.

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
The most important thing we care about when we do prediction is the error and its average value.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
Prediction is a function that calculates error or probability density.

15:23.000 --> 15:32.000
Since this is a static situation, we encounter a lot of challenges.

15:32.000 --> 15:43.000
Today, I will talk about how to connect our scientific problems to initial conditions.

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
This is what the weather forecast we know is doing.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
It is to connect the problem to the initial condition problem.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Now I have two groups of experiments.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
One group of experiments is the control group.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
The other group of experiments is the contrast group.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
I simulated the spring of 2009.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
There are a lot of variables.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
One of the variables is the initial condition.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
This initial condition contains some information about the electric field and neutral atmosphere.

16:22.000 --> 16:31.000
In this model, it will have the so-called low-level and low-level boundary conditions.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The main part is the neutral atmosphere.

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
Of course, there is also the source of energy, the input of solar energy and high-density energy.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
Basically, in these two groups of experiments, the input of energy and the boundary conditions at the bottom are fixed.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
The only difference is the initial condition.

16:53.000 --> 17:04.000
The final result is that we have almost the same electromagnetic density distribution.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
What does this mean?

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
It means that it implies the following result.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
At first, there may be a big difference in the initial condition of this system.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
However, as time goes by, this error will gradually be reduced to a fixed value.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
In fact, this is not what we want to happen.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
And this is different from the actual observation.

17:31.000 --> 17:40.000
We just showed an image of the daily change of electromagnetic density over time.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
You can see that it actually changes every day.

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
So, if we express this change in terms of probability, it will not be reduced to a stable state.

17:53.000 --> 18:04.000
So, a very interesting phenomenon is that when we forecast electricity prices, we also have to consider the neutral atmosphere.

18:05.000 --> 18:16.000
If we go back to the high-density ratio just now, this is actually a very easy-to-understand situation.

18:16.000 --> 18:25.000
In fact, the density of the neutral atmosphere is much higher than the so-called electromagnetic density.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
And this density is several times higher.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
You can see that the unit below this is 10 to the 5th square, 10 to the 6th square, 10 to the 7th square, 10 to the 8th square.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
This is several thousand times the difference.

18:39.000 --> 18:49.000
So, this result implies that we also need to consider the neutral atmosphere while forecasting electricity prices.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
This is also one of the reasons why we are working now.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
At present, we are doing high-density atmospheric wind farm simulation.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
The so-called high-density atmosphere is actually the boundary condition of the bottom layer of the model we just used.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
It is about 97 kilometers high.

19:11.000 --> 19:23.000
The initial idea of ​​this study is that we do not want the system we want to forecast to be close to a fixed value.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
We do not want it to be close to the same state as time flows.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
Because this is not quite in line with the daily changes in the electricity layer we observe.

19:38.000 --> 19:51.000
The above is why I am doing my current doctoral research.

19:51.000 --> 20:02.000
If you are interested, there are more detailed information on the website.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
So, if you are interested, you can google this topic.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
The above is the summary of my speech.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
Forecasting has many things to be confirmed and completed.

20:21.000 --> 20:31.000
I hope that we will be able to provide such a service in the future.

20:31.000 --> 20:41.000
Just like our low-layer atmospheric weather forecast system.

20:41.000 --> 20:50.000
I think this is a good long-term goal for a doctoral student.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.000
The above is my report. Thank you.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
I am Ming-Hsuan, the host.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Our current video is a recording.

21:04.000 --> 21:13.000
If you have any questions, you can choose to ask during the recording.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
At the same time, these videos will be uploaded to YouTube.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
In addition, we can also discuss after the recording is turned off.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
If you have any questions, please ask them now.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
If you want to be recorded in the video.

21:29.000 --> 21:54.000
If you don't have any questions, let's turn off the recording.
