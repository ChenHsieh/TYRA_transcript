0	7000	Welcome to today's TerraTalk. I am today's host, Zhang Yan-Yong.
7000	13000	We are very honored to invite Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a speech.
13000	16000	Today's topic is from the base to the surface.
16000	26000	The impact of aquatic plants on the surface of the environment and sedimentary sediments in the environment.
27000	32000	Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Chen Qian-Yong.
38000	46000	Dr. Chen Qian-Yong is currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.
46000	55000	Her main job is in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability Project.
55000	60000	Her Ph.D. is in the UIUC Archaeology Department.
60000	75000	Her main focus is on Interfacial Gas Transfer and Sediment Dynamics in Environmental Flows with Aquatic Vegetation.
75000	78000	She is currently in Oak Ridge.
78000	85000	Of course, she does a lot of modeling and numerical simulation.
85000	89000	Before she came to the UIUC and got her Ph.D.,
89000	96000	she got her Bachelor's Degree in Physics from Tsinghua University in Taiwan.
96000	103000	Then she got her Master's Degree in Fluid Mechanics from NTU.
103000	118000	Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a wonderful speech.
123000	128000	Thank you for the introduction.
128000	132000	My name is Chen Qian-Yong.
132000	140000	I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.
140000	148000	I am honored to be able to give a lecture on Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability on Taira's platform.
148000	153000	As I mentioned earlier, I expect the audience to be from all walks of life.
153000	158000	So I will try to make my presentation as general as possible.
158000	165000	I hope that everyone will be able to understand some of the topics in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability project.
165000	170000	I will mainly focus on the research topics during my Ph.D.
170000	179000	I will introduce how hydropower resilience affects the surface of the environment, and the mechanism of subsurface sedimentation.
179000	187000	I hope to make some small extensions and introduce some of the most popular research topics in our field.
187000	195000	As I mentioned earlier, I hope the whole process will be easier and more discussionable.
195000	200000	If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
200000	204000	I will briefly introduce my background.
204000	208000	I graduated from Tsinghua University and majored in physics.
208000	212000	I went to Taiwan University to major in fluid mechanics.
212000	215000	After that, I moved to Illinois.
215000	219000	I majored in soil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois.
219000	221000	I am a Ph.D. in hydropower engineering.
221000	224000	I just finished my master's degree last month.
224000	231000	So I just moved to the National Laboratory of Hydropower in Tennessee for the first week.
231000	235000	I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.
235000	239000	I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.
241000	245000	My research during my Ph.D. is mainly focused on hydropower.
245000	251000	Although I am now at Oak Ridge, which is famous for numerical simulation,
251000	254000	my work during my master's degree is mainly numerical simulation.
254000	262000	However, during my Ph.D., I mainly do experiments and image processing.
262000	267000	Basically, I will place different hydropower structures in my hydropower experiments.
267000	270000	I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,
270000	274000	or I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,
274000	276000	and see how it affects the flow of water.
276000	281000	Then we will use high-resolution laser imaging to do hydropower testing.
281000	285000	I will explain the more detailed experiment settings and methods later.
285000	289000	My main field of research is applied in environmental fluid mechanics,
289000	293000	fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower.
293000	296000	Before I get into my research topic,
296000	299000	I want to spend some time to introduce
299000	302000	what the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering is doing.
302000	305000	I also want to explain what the Department of Applied Environmental Fluid Mechanics,
305000	308000	fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower are.
308000	311000	I hope to give you some basic concepts.
311000	316000	You may have some questions about why I am studying applied fluid mechanics in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.
316000	319000	Because people generally have an impression of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering
319000	322000	that it is about building houses or buildings.
322000	323000	In fact, it is not like that.
323000	328000	The Department of Applied Environmental Engineering has a very wide range of things to study.
328000	330000	For example, if you can see the English name of its department.
330000	331000	It is called Schedule of Engineering,
331000	336000	In fact, in Chinese, we should refer to it as Civil or Jameson Engineering.
336000	338000	Then in Taiwan, generally speaking,
338000	341000	we separate the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering from the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.
341000	342000	Then, like TAIWEN and JIAUCHEN State University,
342000	343000	there is a Department of Applied Environmental Engineering
343000	346000	and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering lacks Opining Institute,
346000	348000	a branch of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.
348000	349000	Then ChengDinh University,
349000	353000	even has a department of Applied Environmental Engineering.
353000	355000	In addition, the Department of AppliedEnvironmental Engineering is allowed to study mainly heavily in China,
355000	356000	In fact, like in the United States,
356000	360000	generally speaking, the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering are integrated into a department.
360000	363000	So we call it Civil and Environmental Engineering.
363000	364000	In the field of Applied Environmental Engineering,
364000	368000	in fact, it includes structures, geotechnical,
368000	370000	or transportation, etc.
370000	374000	Then the field of Applied Environmental Engineering is mainly divided into water quality, air pollution, and green energy.
374000	380000	Among them is the water resource engineering, natural disasters, climate change, etc.
380000	383000	are all in the field between Applied Environmental Engineering and Applied Environmental Engineering.
383000	385000	In fact, there are a lot of professors in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering in the United States
385000	389000	are engaged in research on this area.
389000	390000	OK, good.
390000	392000	Here I want to ask you a question.
392000	394000	I just talked about water resource engineering,
394000	398000	which is the field of my Ph.D. main focus program.
398000	400000	When it comes to water resource engineering,
400000	403000	generally speaking, you will think of what it is about,
403000	406000	what this field is doing.
406000	410000	That is, everyone can express their own impression.
410000	411000	When it comes to water resource engineering,
411000	416000	what do you think of?
416000	418000	Does anyone want to share?
418000	419000	Let me talk about it first.
419000	420000	OK.
420000	421000	I may be a little awkward.
421000	424000	What I think of intuitively is to build a water dam,
424000	428000	or to build a channel, something like that.
428000	429000	Yes, yes.
429000	430000	Yes.
430000	434000	OK, does anyone else want to share?
434000	435000	When it comes to water resource engineering,
435000	440000	what do you think of?
440000	441000	OK.
441000	444000	Everyone may be a little shy.
444000	448000	In fact, I just talked about building a water dam and then a channel.
448000	449000	That's right.
449000	452000	This is indeed what water resource engineering is doing.
452000	454000	Well, roughly speaking,
454000	455000	I like it very much.
455000	457000	Our university has a course
457000	459000	called Water Resource Engineering Discussion.
459000	462000	And in this course,
462000	463000	when the teacher is talking,
463000	465000	I like to use this picture
465000	468000	to roughly explain what water resource engineering is.
468000	469000	Basically, it actually
469000	471000	puts all the water,
471000	475000	that is, the water cycle in the natural world,
475000	479000	to do research on each different component.
479000	481000	I personally like to divide it into
481000	483000	four different sub-fields,
483000	485000	such as aquatics,
485000	486000	groundwater,
486000	487000	aquatics,
487000	489000	water resource planning,
489000	491000	and management.
491000	493000	As I mentioned earlier,
493000	495000	building a water dam or a channel
495000	498000	is more like aquatics.
498000	500000	Because you may have to calculate some fluid mechanics
500000	501000	to know that
501000	503000	what you are going to build
503000	504000	for your dam and base.
504000	506000	So it's actually a bit cross-referential
506000	507000	because you still have to
507000	509000	do some structural engineering
509000	511000	with the traditional earth and wood.
511000	512000	Because they understand the structure
512000	515000	and we understand fluid mechanics.
515000	518000	But water resource engineering is actually mainly
518000	520000	I like to divide it into these four.
520000	523000	I'm actually mainly focused on
523000	524000	environmental fluid mechanics.
524000	526000	And this thing can actually be said to be
526000	528000	one of the components in fluid mechanics.
528000	530000	But it can also be said to be
530000	532000	a university door that comes out independently.
532000	533000	Environmental fluid mechanics
533000	534000	is actually mainly about
534000	535000	how matter
535000	536000	spreads and spreads
536000	538000	in the natural world.
538000	540000	This natural fluid can be water
540000	542000	and it can also be air.
542000	545000	For example, the emission of factory smoke.
545000	547000	And then there's the construction of a water reservoir.
547000	549000	And then the impact on natural water flow.
549000	551000	And then there's the waves of the ocean
551000	552000	and the sea cycle.
552000	554000	Or even the typhoon.
554000	555000	Because I just mentioned that
555000	556000	your natural fluid can be water
556000	557000	or air.
557000	558000	So typhoon
558000	559000	These are actually
559000	560000	environmental fluid mechanics
560000	562000	research areas.
562000	563000	And then I've been talking about
563000	565000	a fluid phenomenon.
565000	566000	It's turbulence.
566000	568000	It's called turbulence in English.
568000	570000	This Chinese can actually be called turbulence
570000	571000	It can also be called turbulence.
571000	573000	So if you've ever been on a plane,
573000	574000	you must have heard of it.
574000	577000	We often have turbulence on the plane.
577000	578000	What about this turbulence?
578000	580000	In fact, in fluid mechanics,
580000	581000	It's also a very popular
581000	583000	It's also a very important topic.
583000	585000	Like the famous physicist
585000	587000	Richard Feynman
587000	588000	once said
588000	589000	Turbulence is a
589000	591000	It's been around for over a hundred years.
591000	593000	And then it hasn't been completely solved.
593000	595000	A complex physical problem.
595000	598000	So what exactly is turbulence?
598000	601000	Turbulence can be said to be a kind of fluid
601000	602000	Fluid state
602000	605000	What about when the flow rate is very small?
605000	607000	Fluid is a layer-by-layer fluid.
607000	608000	They don't mix with each other.
608000	609000	And then this state
609000	610000	We call it a flow.
610000	611000	But when you
611000	613000	When the speed of the object increases,
613000	614000	The flow of the fluid
614000	616000	There will be a wave-like pendulum.
616000	618000	And then the frequency of the pendulum and the government
618000	621000	The flow rate will increase faster and faster.
621000	623000	So when the fluid reaches
623000	625000	When it's past the transition stage
625000	626000	It will enter
626000	628000	A state called turbulence
628000	630000	When it reaches this speed
630000	632000	In fact, you can find that the flow becomes
632000	634000	It's no longer clear.
634000	635000	You can't track
635000	636000	Every flow
636000	639000	It's from the beginning to the end
639000	641000	How does it flow in the middle?
641000	643000	And then there will be a lot of small whirlpools in the flow.
643000	644000	Then these whirlpools
644000	646000	We call it turbulence or turbulence.
646000	647000	The scientist here
647000	649000	Propose a parameter
649000	651000	It's called Reynolds.
651000	652000	And then use this parameter
652000	653000	We can assess
653000	655000	That's how messy this flow is.
655000	657000	It's basically a
657000	660000	The ratio of fluid inertia to fluid viscosity
660000	662000	So the bigger the Reynolds number
662000	664000	It means that the fluid is more chaotic.
664000	667000	A simple example is a bee and water.
667000	668000	Like bees, we can know
668000	669000	It's very viscous.
669000	671000	So it's your molecule.
671000	673000	That's your Reynolds number.
673000	675000	The Reynolds number is very small.
675000	676000	So basically
676000	679000	We say honey
679000	680000	This kind of thing
680000	683000	It's not so messy.
683000	684000	Not turbulence
684000	685000	But like water
685000	687000	Especially in a natural environment
687000	688000	Like a waterfall
688000	690000	Basically because it's very viscous
690000	693000	So once your inertia is very fast
693000	694000	Your Reynolds number is big
694000	697000	You'll find that it's basically very messy.
697000	699000	And then it's easy to produce this kind of turbulence.
699000	701000	In the natural world, in fact,
701000	703000	Most of the fluids belong to turbulence.
703000	705000	So turbulence is studying environmental fluid mechanics.
705000	708000	Is a very important indicator
708000	711000	Yes, and then like a river.
711000	713000	And then the volcano erupts
713000	716000	In fact, it's all a kind of turbulence.
716000	719000	A phenomenon on the environmental fluid
719000	722000	Yes, so my research is basically
722000	724000	The concept of fluid mechanics and turbulence
724000	726000	Applied to ecological fluid mechanics
726000	728000	What is ecological fluid mechanics?
728000	732000	It is to explore the interaction between fluid mechanics and ecology.
732000	734000	So it can be roughly divided into three major areas.
734000	736000	One is fluid mechanics
736000	739000	One is what we call geological geometry and ecology.
739000	742000	Interaction between each other
742000	744000	Interconnection and influence
744000	746000	Just give a simple example
746000	749000	It's like if I have some beavers.
749000	751000	That's what we call the water in the river.
751000	753000	That should be in Chinese.
753000	756000	Because the beaver basically builds the water dam.
756000	757000	We call it beaver dam
757000	759000	Once this beaver
759000	761000	It belongs to an ecological phenomenon
761000	764000	And then these animals are in the river.
764000	765000	Built a dam
765000	768000	After the dam is built, it will change the fluid.
768000	769000	Change the fluid
769000	771000	It may change the entire river bed.
771000	773000	So the whole geological geometry will change
773000	775000	After the geological geometry changes
775000	777000	It may come back to affect you.
777000	779000	This reasonable ecology
779000	781000	Because you have changed the geological
781000	783000	Maybe it's more suitable for them to survive.
783000	784000	So it becomes more
784000	786000	Or become more unsuitable for survival
786000	787000	Then they will become less
787000	789000	So it's actually a mutual
789000	791000	How to say
791000	795000	An ecological chain that affects each other
796000	798000	Ecological geometry is currently in the water resource project
798000	800000	It's a relatively new
800000	802000	And a more and more popular field
802000	804000	Mainly because people began to realize
804000	806000	The importance of many ecological projects
806000	809000	Like the redwood forest on the bank of the river
809000	810000	The existence of redwood forest
810000	813000	It helps to naturally block the waves
813000	815000	Then reduce the erosion of the river
815000	818000	From the perspective of biodiversity
818000	821000	At the same time, it can also provide different species
821000	823000	An ecological habitat
823000	825000	At the same time, the large trees on the bank of the river
825000	827000	Also play a similar role
827000	830000	Okay, so much
830000	832000	I hope to take advantage of the time in front
832000	834000	Have a little concept with everyone
834000	836000	What I did
836000	838000	What kind of field
838000	841000	Now it's time to enter my topic
841000	843000	My doctoral research
843000	846000	Mainly doing experiments
846000	847000	To explore
847000	850000	When I have these aquatic plants in the water
850000	851000	It's not looking at the river now
851000	852000	Is looking at aquatic plants
852000	853000	What about those plants
853000	856000	How to change the flow of water in physics
856000	858000	And then change the flow of water
858000	862000	Nisa's whirlpool and the glory of the air
862000	863000	But in fact
863000	865000	The bottom bed of Nisa
865000	867000	And the transmission
867000	868000	And the glory of the air
868000	869000	It's always been an environmental scientist
869000	871000	A very concerned research topic
871000	874000	That's because Nisa's flush and transmission
874000	877000	It's going to change the river for a long time
877000	879000	Or wetland or river
879000	881000	Or the terrain of the coast
881000	883000	In fact, in these places
883000	885000	Many different aquatic plants grow
885000	887000	And then the other side is
887000	889000	The amount of water
889000	891000	In fact, this importance
891000	892000	Basically everyone should be very clear
892000	893000	We can simply use
893000	895000	These two pictures as examples
895000	896000	Like the left picture
896000	899000	It means that the amount of water is relatively low
899000	902000	The right picture is a fully nourished lake
902000	903000	So we can clearly find
903000	905000	When the amount of water is low
905000	907000	This lake will greatly limit
907000	909000	The development of the entire creature and the entire ecosystem
909000	910000	On the contrary, it is a system
910000	913000	In an environment where nourishment and air exchange are strong
913000	916000	The development of aquatic life will be relatively smooth
916000	919000	And the ecosystem will be more diverse
919000	920000	In addition
920000	924000	The transmission between air and water
924000	928000	It will also affect the entire regional climate model prediction
928000	929000	Like IPCC
929000	932000	We call it the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee
932000	934000	The study report in 2001
934000	936000	It specifically pointed out that
936000	937000	River, lake, etc.
937000	941000	The water and air exchange in the inland water area
941000	943000	This is on the water and air exchange
943000	945000	There is a large proportion of this emission
945000	947000	So it takes more research
947000	949000	To make further and more accurate estimates
949000	952000	And then do some more accurate
952000	955000	Modeling to do the whole
955000	959000	Especially the correction of the regional climate model
959000	961000	But the important thing is
961000	965000	In the case of inland water
965000	968000	In fact, aquatic plants play a very important role
968000	970000	And their distribution is very wide
970000	972000	But past research
972000	975000	In fact, there is no consideration of the existence of aquatic plants
975000	977000	Most of the time, it's just a simple stream
977000	980000	Then in a river with nothing at all
980000	981000	Run
981000	983000	In fact, more and more scientists have found
983000	986000	This kind of simplification is actually not very
986000	989000	Does not match the real nature
989000	992000	So there are those errors
992000	994000	So in the past few decades
994000	996000	In fact, many geophysicists
996000	998000	They will start
998000	1000000	Find a way to discuss
1000000	1002000	Aquatic plants affect the environment
1002000	1004000	The impact of this stream
1004000	1006000	Then we can roughly put
1006000	1008000	The impact of aquatic plants is divided into two categories
1008000	1010000	That one category is when we
1010000	1012000	When there are plants in the water
1012000	1015000	It will block the whole stream
1015000	1017000	The whole operation
1017000	1020000	So it will reduce the flow rate of the river
1020000	1022000	Then change the flow of the entire river
1022000	1024000	The second point is that it has changed the flow
1024000	1026000	So the turbulence in the water will increase
1026000	1028000	Here is a simple example
1028000	1031000	It can be seen from this video
1031000	1034000	When a stream flows from left to right
1034000	1036000	Then if there is a pillar in the middle
1036000	1037000	When it's in the middle
1037000	1038000	Behind this pillar
1038000	1041000	There will be two turbulent currents in different directions
1041000	1043000	At the same time
1043000	1045000	Assuming that there are many in the water
1045000	1048000	A plant group like this
1048000	1050000	Then the whole stream will basically be
1050000	1051000	Various turbulence
1051000	1053000	And become very chaotic
1055000	1057000	In addition, past research has also proposed
1057000	1059000	That is, with the density of the plant group
1059000	1062000	And the proportion of plants immersed in the water
1062000	1064000	The strength and characteristics of the flow
1064000	1066000	And the flow will be completely different
1066000	1068000	The so-called immersion ratio refers to
1068000	1071000	The proportion of plants in the water
1071000	1073000	So it can be from
1073000	1075000	It's completely in the water
1075000	1077000	We call it Emergent Vegetation
1077000	1079000	It's the whole thing that emerges in the water
1079000	1082000	And then it's submerged in the water
1082000	1083000	That's Submerge
1083000	1084000	Under different immersion ratios
1084000	1086000	It will produce
1086000	1087000	The size of the vortex
1087000	1088000	And the whole
1088000	1091000	The flow will be completely different
1092000	1093000	The main generated turbulence
1093000	1096000	Can be divided into two according to their magnitude
1096000	1098000	One we call
1098000	1099000	Stem Scale Turbulence
1099000	1102000	That's mainly the turbulence in the video
1102000	1104000	It's like
1104000	1106000	Behind each plant
1106000	1108000	Generate horizontal rotation
1108000	1109000	This vortex
1109000	1111000	So then the scale of this vortex
1111000	1113000	It's with my plant
1113000	1115000	This pillar
1115000	1117000	Uh, the plant is called the meridian
1117000	1118000	But if it's a pillar
1118000	1120000	It's related to its diameter
1120000	1122000	Yes, so we call it
1122000	1123000	Stem Scale Turbulence
1123000	1124000	The other one is
1124000	1126000	When my whole plant group
1126000	1127000	Dive into the water
1127000	1129000	Just like this picture
1129000	1131000	When you dive into the water
1131000	1133000	The top of the plant group will be because
1133000	1135000	The speed of the upstream and downstream water flow is different
1135000	1137000	Because there is no plant on the top
1137000	1139000	So its water flows faster
1139000	1140000	The downstream
1140000	1141000	Because there are obstacles
1141000	1142000	So the water flow is slower
1142000	1144000	What about the upstream and downstream flow differences
1144000	1145000	Will produce a
1145000	1147000	Vertical ratio
1147000	1149000	It's a vertical
1149000	1150000	Rotating vortex
1150000	1151000	What about this vortex
1151000	1152000	Its magnitude is
1152000	1153000	It will be bigger
1153000	1155000	Compared to my plant root
1155000	1157000	What caused the stem scale to be bigger
1157000	1158000	That's what we call
1158000	1161000	Uh, Canopy Scale Vortex
1161000	1162000	And then these two magnitudes of the vortex
1162000	1163000	Will be in the water
1163000	1165000	Transmitted to the surface of the water
1165000	1166000	Or even the bottom of the bed
1166000	1167000	To affect the water surface
1167000	1168000	The rate of erosion
1168000	1169000	With the bottom of the bed
1169000	1172000	The whole mechanism of sandblasting and floating
1172000	1173000	Yes
1174000	1176000	What about the main purpose of my research
1176000	1177000	Is to do experiments
1177000	1178000	And then to understand
1178000	1179000	Is the aquatic plant
1179000	1181000	How to influence
1181000	1182000	These two questions
1182000	1183000	Is
1183000	1184000	It first changes the flow
1184000	1186000	And then how does this flow affect
1186000	1187000	That's
1187000	1188000	Uh, our Air Water
1188000	1189000	Gas Transfer
1189000	1190000	And that's
1190000	1192000	The suspension of my bottom bed
1192000	1193000	Yes
1194000	1196000	Okay, so what's next
1196000	1198000	I'm going to introduce a little bit
1198000	1200000	My experiment method and settings
1200000	1201000	Oh, yeah, that's it
1201000	1203000	I don't know if you have any questions
1203000	1204000	That is
1204000	1205000	If you have any questions
1205000	1206000	You are welcome to interrupt me at any time
1206000	1207000	That is
1207000	1208000	Because it may be different fields
1208000	1210000	And then sometimes it's too fast
1210000	1211000	Is to put some
1211000	1212000	Maybe general
1212000	1213000	General people don't understand
1213000	1214000	Things to say
1214000	1215000	Just bring it directly
1215000	1216000	So if you have any questions
1216000	1218000	You are welcome to interrupt me at any time
1218000	1219000	Yes
1220000	1221000	Uh, I have a question
1221000	1222000	Ok
1222000	1223000	Is
1223000	1224000	Maybe before you start
1224000	1225000	This kind of rigorous
1225000	1226000	Before the lab experiment
1226000	1227000	There will be some
1227000	1229000	I have a question
1229000	1230000	Is
1230000	1232000	Uh, you do research in this area
1232000	1234000	In addition to
1234000	1235000	Physics
1235000	1236000	And this kind of physical
1236000	1237000	Basic science
1237000	1238000	To understand
1238000	1239000	You will need to understand
1239000	1241000	Aquatic plant
1241000	1242000	Is it biological
1242000	1243000	Or plant-related
1243000	1244000	Background knowledge
1245000	1246000	Basically
1246000	1247000	If
1247000	1249000	You have this knowledge
1249000	1250000	That's probably the best
1250000	1251000	Because
1251000	1252000	Uh
1252000	1254000	For example, when we set up the experiment
1254000	1256000	We will think about it
1256000	1258000	Uh, my plant
1258000	1259000	That one
1259000	1261000	What am I going to use to represent the plant
1261000	1263000	That's like my experiment right now
1263000	1264000	I'm using
1264000	1265000	I'll talk about it later
1265000	1266000	I'm using a harder one
1266000	1267000	That kind of acrylic
1267000	1268000	That hard
1268000	1269000	Acrylic
1269000	1270000	It can represent
1270000	1271000	Is a special plant
1271000	1272000	It's the plant
1272000	1273000	The plant is harder
1273000	1274000	That plant
1274000	1275000	Harder
1275000	1276000	The state
1276000	1277000	We can have
1277000	1279000	There are several special species
1279000	1281000	And then if you understand this ecology
1281000	1282000	You will know
1282000	1283000	OK, these species
1283000	1285000	Where is it mainly distributed
1285000	1286000	Like a river mouth
1286000	1288000	Or a more upstream river
1288000	1290000	So we can use this knowledge
1290000	1291000	To design our experiment
1291000	1293000	Let it go as far as possible
1293000	1294000	Just in physics
1294000	1295000	With
1295000	1296000	With real
1296000	1297000	To match
1297000	1298000	It's either
1298000	1299000	It's you
1299000	1300000	It depends on whether you want to be flexible
1300000	1301000	The
1301000	1302000	Aquatic plant
1302000	1303000	Or
1303000	1304000	Say
1304000	1305000	The kind of plant
1305000	1306000	Yeah
1306000	1307000	So
1307000	1308000	Uh, for me
1308000	1309000	I dare not say
1309000	1310000	I
1310000	1312000	I know a lot about ecology
1312000	1313000	Because I am also
1313000	1315000	I started to get in touch with this field during my PhD
1315000	1316000	So I started to go
1316000	1317000	With
1317000	1319000	It's like talking to ecologists
1319000	1320000	That
1320000	1322000	So actually this is also quite
1322000	1325000	It takes a combination of cross-fields
1325000	1326000	That
1326000	1327000	Actually in
1327000	1328000	Uh, after the speech
1328000	1329000	I will
1329000	1330000	Share some
1330000	1331000	Very interesting topics
1331000	1332000	Is that we have some
1332000	1334000	Cooperate with biologists
1334000	1335000	And then do fish
1335000	1336000	With
1336000	1337000	With
1337000	1338000	Water research
1338000	1340000	I will add this later
1340000	1341000	Um
1341000	1342000	Understand
1342000	1343000	Thank you
1343000	1344000	This is a very
1344000	1346000	It's a very good question
1346000	1347000	Ok
1347000	1348000	Ok
1348000	1349000	Then
1349000	1351000	I will continue
1351000	1353000	So now I'm going to talk about my experiment
1353000	1354000	Settings and methods
1354000	1355000	So basically
1355000	1356000	The aquatic plant I use
1356000	1357000	Is a
1357000	1358000	Circular aquatic plant
1358000	1359000	What about the water flow
1359000	1360000	Is driven by two different
1360000	1362000	Uh, the plate rotates in different directions
1362000	1363000	To drive
1363000	1364000	And then we can use
1364000	1365000	Control the speed of the plate rotation
1365000	1367000	To control the flow of different water flows
1367000	1368000	That
1368000	1369000	This one
1369000	1370000	Is my aquatic
1370000	1371000	Uh
1371000	1373000	Is the photo of the experimental aquatic
1373000	1374000	So basically
1374000	1375000	This is not very big
1375000	1376000	It's the whole
1376000	1377000	Uh
1377000	1378000	The section of the test
1378000	1380000	It's about 200 centimeters long
1380000	1381000	And then the whole width
1381000	1382000	It's actually only 15 centimeters
1382000	1383000	Yes
1383000	1384000	So in this experiment
1384000	1386000	I just mentioned
1386000	1388000	I use a lot of acrylate
1388000	1390000	To simulate a plant with a higher hardness
1390000	1391000	That experiment
1391000	1392000	In fact, I also have
1392000	1394000	Do experiments with softer plants
1394000	1395000	But in this study
1395000	1396000	We mainly focus on
1396000	1398000	I mainly want to share with you today
1398000	1399000	Is
1399000	1402000	Simulate some of the results of harder plants
1402000	1405000	In addition to that, we are at the bottom of the bed
1405000	1407000	Also laid a 10-centimeter layer of sand
1407000	1408000	Is to simulate
1408000	1409000	Is the natural river
1409000	1410000	Natural river state
1410000	1411000	Because there will be sand at the bottom of the bed
1411000	1413000	Otherwise, how do I see the whirlpool of sand
1413000	1414000	Yes
1414000	1415000	So I just
1415000	1417000	I also laid a layer of sand
1417000	1418000	And then finally
1418000	1420000	I put it
1420000	1421000	Uh
1421000	1422000	Test
1422000	1423000	Is to test
1423000	1424000	Water flow rate and
1424000	1427000	Measurement instrument of nutrient concentration
1427000	1429000	Let me tell you a little bit about it
1429000	1430000	I use it to measure
1430000	1432000	Uh, the water flow rate tool
1432000	1433000	We call this system
1433000	1435000	Called PIV
1435000	1437000	The full name is Particle Image Velocimetry
1437000	1439000	So the whole system is basically
1439000	1441000	Made up of three important components
1441000	1442000	Is
1442000	1444000	First of all, we have to put it in the water
1444000	1446000	We call it Neutral Volume
1446000	1447000	Powder particles
1447000	1449000	The so-called Neutral Volume means
1449000	1451000	Uh, the density of its particles
1451000	1453000	Has to be about the same as water
1453000	1455000	Then it can float evenly in the water
1455000	1457000	And flow along the water
1457000	1460000	Then we need a high-intensity laser
1460000	1462000	To illuminate these powder particles
1462000	1463000	And then finally
1463000	1464000	A high-speed camera
1464000	1465000	To capture
1465000	1466000	Each time point
1466000	1468000	The location of each powder particle
1468000	1469000	That's like
1469000	1470000	This picture is
1470000	1472000	Uh, my whole raw image
1472000	1473000	Photos taken
1473000	1474000	So these points
1474000	1477000	The highlights are actually those powder particles
1477000	1478000	And then what happens next
1478000	1479000	Once we have each time point
1479000	1481000	After the location of each powder particle
1481000	1482000	We can compare
1482000	1484000	It's the first two
1484000	1486000	Uh, in the first two images
1486000	1487000	Different time points
1487000	1489000	The relative location of the powder particles
1489000	1490000	And then calculate
1490000	1493000	The direction and distance of these particles moving
1493000	1494000	And then we'll
1494000	1495000	Because we know
1495000	1496000	We can shoot us
1496000	1498000	Uh, it's the camera
1498000	1499000	The time frame
1499000	1500000	The frame rate
1500000	1502000	So we know the frame rate
1502000	1504000	We know how much time it takes
1504000	1506000	Between each frame
1506000	1507000	And then we have this
1507000	1508000	Displacement
1508000	1509000	We can go
1509000	1511000	Calculate the speed of its movement
1511000	1513000	And then with these fluids
1513000	1515000	It's these fluids
1515000	1517000	The movement speed of the powder particles
1517000	1518000	We can use it to represent
1518000	1519000	It's different locations
1519000	1521000	The flow rate of the water
1521000	1522000	That
1522000	1525000	As for how to measure the rate of surface oxidation
1525000	1526000	We are in the water
1526000	1528000	Put it in what we call
1528000	1531000	This chemical substance called hyaluronic acid
1531000	1532000	That hyaluronic acid
1532000	1534000	It will, uh, melt in the water
1534000	1536000	To react with the oxygen molecules in the water
1536000	1538000	And then it consumes the water's oxygen
1538000	1541000	And then when the oxygen in the water is exhausted
1541000	1542000	What about the time?
1542000	1544000	We can use the right picture
1544000	1546000	It's this picture
1546000	1548000	Uh, the oxygen concentration
1548000	1551000	To monitor the entire process of reoxidation in the water
1551000	1552000	And then
1552000	1553000	And through
1553000	1555000	It's the time it takes to reach the saturation concentration
1555000	1556000	To calculate the whole
1556000	1558000	The rate of surface oxidation
1558000	1559000	How much
1559000	1561000	That
1561000	1564000	In addition to oxidation and flow rate
1564000	1565000	What about
1565000	1567000	We're going to set up another set of experiments
1567000	1569000	To calculate the entire bed
1569000	1571000	It's, uh,
1571000	1574000	The concentration of nitrogen in the water
1574000	1575000	That
1575000	1576000	How to do it
1576000	1577000	We are through lighting
1577000	1579000	And then by the brightness of this image
1579000	1580000	To distinguish
1580000	1582000	It's the position of the nitrogen particles
1582000	1583000	And then calculate
1583000	1586000	It's the concentration of different nitrogen particles in the water
1586000	1587000	That's like this video
1587000	1588000	We can see
1588000	1589000	The nitrogen particles that are suspended
1589000	1591000	It's going to be on the white projection screen
1591000	1594000	It's a little bit of a reflection
1594000	1596000	And then we can set a threshold
1596000	1598000	And then we're going to determine that every pixel
1598000	1599000	It's
1599000	1601000	What's its intensity
1601000	1602000	And then this threshold
1602000	1604000	If it's higher than this threshold
1604000	1605000	Then these
1605000	1606000	These pixels we'll
1606000	1607000	Just treat it as
1607000	1608000	Uh, water
1608000	1609000	Because it's white
1609000	1610000	But if it's lower than this threshold
1610000	1612000	It means it's this little bit
1612000	1613000	Particles
1613000	1615000	And then we're going to set it up
1615000	1616000	It's the nitrogen particles
1616000	1617000	And then
1617000	1618000	And then you can calculate
1618000	1620000	The entire water
1620000	1623000	The concentration of nitrogen in this water column
1625000	1626000	Okay, so
1626000	1627000	Uh, according to the PIV
1627000	1628000	We measured
1628000	1630000	We got the two sides of the flow
1630000	1631000	And then there's the image analysis
1631000	1633000	To analyze the concentration of suspended nitrogen
1633000	1634000	That's why
1634000	1635000	With these two things
1635000	1637000	We can try to answer the first question
1637000	1638000	Is
1638000	1640000	How does the aquatic plant affect
1640000	1642000	The bottom layer of the river
1643000	1645000	Before we discuss this question
1645000	1646000	Let's first understand
1646000	1648000	How does the river wash the bottom layer
1648000	1650000	The nitrogen is washed up
1650000	1652000	What is the mechanism of this nitrogen suspension
1652000	1653000	In fact, this principle
1653000	1655000	Uh, it's a little bit like this
1655000	1658000	When the storm comes
1658000	1660000	How do people get blown up
1660000	1662000	Yeah, it's
1662000	1664000	Uh, it's actually the speed of the fluid
1664000	1666000	It's about the pressure
1666000	1668000	So we can put the picture
1668000	1670000	What about this object in this picture
1670000	1671000	Imagine it's a person
1671000	1672000	Or nitrogen particles
1672000	1675000	That's because the bottom layer has friction
1675000	1676000	So generally speaking
1676000	1677000	When you get close to the bottom layer
1677000	1679000	The flow of wind or water is relatively small
1679000	1680000	The further away from the bottom layer
1680000	1681000	The higher
1681000	1683000	In fact, it flows faster
1683000	1685000	When the fluid is through the human body
1685000	1686000	Or when the nitrogen particles
1686000	1688000	The upper flow rate is faster
1688000	1689000	The lower flow rate is slower
1689000	1691000	So, uh, it's actually like
1691000	1692000	How does the plane take off
1692000	1694000	This Bernoulli
1694000	1696000	Uh, this principle is a bit similar
1696000	1697000	That
1697000	1699000	The pressure above will be smaller
1699000	1700000	The pressure below is greater
1700000	1701000	So provide a
1701000	1702000	Because of this pressure
1702000	1704000	It provides an upward force
1704000	1705000	But
1705000	1707000	What we need to understand is
1707000	1708000	General air and water
1708000	1709000	Basically
1709000	1710000	It's a chaotic mess
1710000	1712000	That's what I just mentioned
1712000	1714000	It's like a typhoon
1714000	1715000	The wind basically
1715000	1717000	It won't keep blowing
1717000	1719000	That's what we look at
1719000	1720000	In terms of speed profile
1720000	1721000	In fact, this profile
1721000	1723000	It's an average speed profile
1723000	1724000	When the wind speed is low
1724000	1726000	People basically don't move
1726000	1727000	It's a momentary rush
1727000	1728000	To blow people
1728000	1729000	Just give
1729000	1730000	Blowing is
1730000	1732000	Uh, even leaving the surface
1732000	1734000	So there's actually more research
1734000	1735000	Point out that
1735000	1738000	What about the mechanism that actually starts the nitrogen floating
1738000	1740000	It's a momentary high-intensity water flow
1740000	1742000	That's what we call
1742000	1745000	The nest flow or the mess flow
1745000	1747000	What about the general river flow
1747000	1751000	The mess flow is mainly caused by the friction of the bottom bed
1751000	1752000	And we're going to go through this
1752000	1754000	The mess flow generated by the friction of the bottom bed
1754000	1755000	With its own
1755000	1757000	Nitrogen is the speed of the sink
1757000	1759000	To make a balance between the two
1759000	1761000	And then we can push out a
1761000	1764000	To predict a different flow rate
1764000	1766000	The profile of the river's nitrogen concentration
1766000	1768000	Then it's like this profile
1768000	1770000	Basically, it's based on this theory
1770000	1771000	It's been pushed out
1771000	1774000	And then with the previous experiments
1774000	1776000	The density of these nitrogens
1776000	1778000	It's basically a match
1778000	1780000	But I just mentioned a little bit
1780000	1782000	What about the past model
1782000	1783000	Only suitable for considering
1783000	1784000	There is no aquatic plant
1784000	1786000	There is no structure
1786000	1789000	Once there is a aquatic plant in the water
1789000	1791000	That's like I mentioned before
1791000	1793000	The whole flow will change
1793000	1795000	So what about my entire speed profile
1795000	1798000	It won't look like this
1798000	1801000	That's from recent research
1801000	1804000	It's when there's a plant in the water
1804000	1806000	Ah, this theory of nitrogen selection
1806000	1807000	The model is not suitable
1807000	1809000	That's because the old model only considers
1809000	1810000	Just like I just mentioned
1810000	1811000	Only consider the bottom bed
1811000	1814000	The effect of the friction of the bottom bed
1814000	1815000	What about the picture on the left
1815000	1818000	The horizontal axis represents the size of the bottom bed
1818000	1822000	And then the vertical axis represents the flow rate of the river
1822000	1824000	That's a very obvious trend
1824000	1827000	You can see that when the flow rate of the river is greater
1827000	1831000	The more nitrogen is transmitted downstream
1831000	1834000	But that's what we found
1834000	1836000	What about these color data points
1836000	1838000	It means that there is a plant
1838000	1840000	So this prediction mode
1840000	1842000	It can only be in line with
1842000	1845000	These points are without any plants
1845000	1848000	So this thing tells us
1848000	1851000	When we have aquatic plants
1851000	1852000	We must consider at the same time
1852000	1855000	The flow rate produced by aquatic plants
1855000	1857000	So if we look at the picture on the right
1857000	1860000	It's when we consider the bottom bed sensitivity at the same time
1860000	1863000	What about the flow rate produced by plants
1863000	1866000	These data in the case of plants
1866000	1871000	It matches the model of this theory that we modified
1871000	1874000	In addition to this
1874000	1877000	What about the overall flow rate effect
1877000	1879000	It's not just two plus
1879000	1882000	In fact, in addition to considering the bottom bed sensitivity
1882000	1885000	In addition to the flow rate produced by aquatic plants
1885000	1889000	The interaction between the two flows
1889000	1892000	It will produce an additional flow structure
1892000	1894000	That's what we call Coherent Structure
1894000	1896000	What about this structure
1896000	1899000	It's usually in the back of the plant
1899000	1901000	Or the place before and after
1901000	1903000	And then close to the bottom bed
1903000	1905000	So this animation on the left is
1905000	1907000	One of our experiments
1908000	1909000	Red means faster
1909000	1911000	Blue means slower
1911000	1913000	Then we can find that the inside of the plant group
1913000	1915000	It's the inside of these pillars
1915000	1917000	The water flow is actually very chaotic
1917000	1919000	And then when you get close to the bottom bed
1919000	1921000	There will be some high-speed water flow
1921000	1923000	It's the red part
1923000	1926000	And then with more sand grains
1926000	1929000	So we have to put this model
1929000	1931000	What we call Coherent Structure
1931000	1936000	This kind of interaction can also be considered
1937000	1938000	So we are based on the plant
1938000	1940000	The average speed of the internal water flow field
1940000	1942000	A new theoretical model
1942000	1944000	And then the whole river
1944000	1947000	Divided into two layers of structure
1947000	1949000	What about the average speed of the upper layer
1949000	1950000	Close to the fixed value
1950000	1953000	So we call it the average speed layer
1953000	1954000	And then in this layer
1954000	1956000	It's basically the sensitivity that can be ignored
1956000	1957000	So in this layer
1957000	1959000	The main mechanism of sand grains is from
1959000	1961000	We just mentioned that the gold of the plant
1961000	1963000	The back of this
1963000	1965000	This kind of water level flow
1965000	1967000	What about the water flow at the bottom
1967000	1969000	We call it the boundary layer of the bottom bed
1969000	1970000	So in this layer
1970000	1971000	It's the mechanism of sand grains
1971000	1974000	It's actually mainly from the bottom bed sensitivity
1974000	1975000	And the gold of the plant
1975000	1976000	And I just mentioned
1976000	1978000	The Coherent Structure of the interaction between the two
1978000	1980000	So all three of them have to be considered
1980000	1982000	At the bottom of this place
1982000	1983000	And then finally
1983000	1985000	What about the new theoretical model
1985000	1987000	With us in the water
1987000	1990000	What about the data obtained from the experiment
1990000	1991000	The three pictures represent
1991000	1994000	The density of sand grains under different currents
1994000	1997000	The circle is our experimental data
1997000	1999000	And the virtual line is our theoretical model
1999000	2001000	So the new theoretical model is roughly
2001000	2003000	It's in line with the experimental data
2003000	2005000	So we can look forward to
2005000	2006000	This new theoretical model
2006000	2008000	Can replace the old model
2008000	2011000	It helps people to be more accurate
2011000	2012000	To predict
2012000	2014000	It's in the case of aquatic plants
2014000	2016000	The density of sand grains
2016000	2018000	This will help us
2018000	2021000	The whole river, lake, wetland
2021000	2022000	Those sand transmission
2022000	2023000	And the geological environment
2023000	2026000	There is a more accurate prediction and understanding
2028000	2029000	Okay, so we're done with the bottom bed
2029000	2031000	And then we go back to the surface
2031000	2032000	We're going to see
2032000	2033000	The flow structure produced by the plant group
2033000	2035000	How does it affect the surface of the water
2035000	2036000	The process of gas transmission
2037000	2040000	What about the gas transmission of the water table
2040000	2043000	It's mainly controlled by three big mechanisms
2043000	2044000	And one of them is
2044000	2045000	I've been emphasizing
2045000	2047000	It's the structure in the water
2047000	2049000	That is, the vortex in the water
2049000	2050000	Wait a minute
2050000	2052000	My pointer seems to have run away
2052000	2054000	Okay, that's it
2054000	2057000	What about the other two main mechanisms
2057000	2060000	It's the wind on the surface
2060000	2061000	The mechanism of this blow
2061000	2063000	And then there's my wave motion
2063000	2064000	It's my wave
2064000	2065000	But in general
2065000	2066000	In larger water bodies
2066000	2068000	Like lakes and oceans
2068000	2070000	Water table wind and waves
2070000	2071000	It's the main influence
2071000	2073000	Surface gas transmission and erosion mechanism
2074000	2076000	But for smaller water bodies
2076000	2079000	Like rivers or smaller lakes and ponds
2079000	2081000	In fact, the flow structure in the water
2081000	2083000	It's the main influence mechanism
2083000	2085000	And that's what I'm going to do
2085000	2087000	The main part of the study
2088000	2090000	What about the old theory
2090000	2092000	In fact, it's mainly for simplified rivers
2092000	2093000	That is, again
2093000	2095000	That is, they ignored the water body influence again
2096000	2098000	And this model is
2098000	2099000	It's like this
2099000	2101000	What about the surface of the water
2101000	2103000	There's a very thin layer of fusion
2103000	2104000	And then the air in the water table
2104000	2105000	You can use this
2105000	2106000	This mix
2106000	2107000	In this fusion
2107000	2108000	By spreading
2108000	2110000	From the surface through the fusion
2110000	2111000	Transmitted to the water
2111000	2114000	And the flow produced by the bottom layer
2114000	2115000	That is, the whirlpool in the water
2115000	2117000	There's a certain chance
2117000	2118000	Transmitted to the water table
2118000	2121000	And then to increase the entire surface layer
2121000	2123000	The spread of fusion air
2123000	2126000	And then it increases the whole air
2126000	2128000	The speed of transmission in the interface
2129000	2130000	What about this model
2130000	2132000	It must be based on different flows
2132000	2134000	Make some assumptions to estimate
2134000	2136000	That is, the water
2136000	2138000	The time period of the whirlpool transmission to the surface
2138000	2140000	That is, behind us
2140000	2142000	This TS
2142000	2144000	What about this TS
2144000	2147000	It basically follows different flows
2147000	2149000	And there are different estimations
2149000	2151000	So in the case of plants
2151000	2154000	We have to do more for this old model
2154000	2155000	Especially this TS
2155000	2157000	To make further corrections
2158000	2160000	In order to discuss the distribution of different plant groups
2160000	2162000	The impact on the flow
2162000	2165000	We experimented with three different plants
2165000	2168000	That is, one is what we call fully emergent
2168000	2170000	It's basically my emergence ratio
2170000	2172000	That's one
2172000	2174000	And then there's the other half
2174000	2175000	Half of it is in there
2175000	2177000	And then there's the main part
2177000	2178000	Most of it is in there
2178000	2179000	These two situations
2179000	2181000	So there are three different kinds
2181000	2182000	And then we also set
2182000	2184000	The density of two different plant groups
2184000	2186000	The main reason is like I mentioned before
2186000	2188000	Is that the difference in density and density
2188000	2190000	Will directly lead to different flows
2190000	2192000	And then it affects the structure of the entire fluid
2192000	2195000	And the transmission rate of the surface gas
2196000	2198000	And then there's the experiment of each group
2198000	2200000	We also control the flow of different water
2200000	2202000	And then reach different Reynolds numbers
2202000	2205000	And then we're going to talk about the structural characteristics of the flow
2208000	2210000	It's a little stuck here
2210000	2212000	Okay, so this is our
2212000	2215000	PIV primitive image animation
2215000	2216000	And then from this animation
2216000	2218000	In fact, we can already see
2218000	2220000	That's the difference in the flow rate
2220000	2222000	Under different immersive ratios
2222000	2224000	Like the picture on the left
2224000	2226000	It's fully emergent
2226000	2227000	And then we can see
2227000	2229000	These pink particles
2229000	2231000	It's going to be a little messy
2231000	2233000	There's one behind the plant
2233000	2234000	We can actually see
2234000	2236000	It has a kind of vortex
2236000	2238000	A vortex of rotation
2238000	2240000	But in the other two
2240000	2241000	It's the immersion ratio
2241000	2243000	When it's less than one
2243000	2244000	We can see that
2244000	2247000	It's above the plant group
2247000	2249000	There will be a more vertical motion
2249000	2251000	And then we're going to
2251000	2255000	Do the flow rate analysis for it
2255000	2257000	And then it's even more obvious
2257000	2260000	It's in a fully emergent situation
2260000	2262000	Basically, the flow is very messy
2262000	2264000	And then the entire flow rate
2264000	2267000	The profile is basically the same
2267000	2269000	But when I was in the water
2269000	2273000	What about the bottom and the top
2273000	2275000	There will be a very obvious difference
2275000	2277000	So you can see that the top is basically red
2277000	2279000	It means that the flow rate is faster
2279000	2280000	What about the bottom
2280000	2283000	Our flow rate is slower
2283000	2285000	The profile of the average flow rate
2285000	2286000	It's even more obvious
2286000	2289000	You can see this feature
2289000	2292000	In addition to the data of the speed plant
2292000	2295000	We can further use this speed plant
2295000	2297000	To calculate and quantify the flow rate
2297000	2299000	The strength in each flow field
2299000	2301000	The blue area represents
2301000	2302000	The area with a stronger strength
2302000	2305000	And the red one means that the flow rate is weaker
2305000	2308000	So when the growth ratio is 1
2308000	2310000	It's in a fully emergent situation
2310000	2312000	The main flow comes from the stem scale
2312000	2314000	That's what I just mentioned
2314000	2316000	And then the distribution of these flow rates
2316000	2317000	It's basically relatively even
2317000	2319000	It also represents the flow rate of the entire flow field
2319000	2322000	It can be represented as
2322000	2324000	Use the average value of the flow field
2324000	2325000	To represent
2325000	2328000	Because it's basically distributed more evenly
2328000	2331000	But when the growth ratio is less than 1
2331000	2333000	The top of the plant group
2333000	2335000	Because of the difference in flow rate between the two layers
2335000	2338000	It produces a very strong canopy scale
2338000	2341000	It's more dominant in the whole system
2341000	2344000	So at this time, the entire flow rate of the flow field can be used
2344000	2345000	The maximum value of the flow rate
2345000	2348000	That is, it is usually at the top of the plant group
2348000	2350000	To represent
2350000	2353000	Make a more dominant value
2353000	2357000	Then go back to our Modify model
2357000	2359000	So according to the result of our experiment
2359000	2360000	We use different characteristics
2360000	2364000	The strength of the flow to change the original theoretical model
2364000	2368000	Then I don't think I'm going to do it one by one
2368000	2370000	Just explore the details of the theory
2370000	2373000	Then I quickly summarize this point
2373000	2376000	That is, when the ratio of the plant group is 1
2376000	2377000	In a fully emergent situation
2377000	2381000	We use the average strength of the flow rate of the entire flow field
2381000	2382000	To estimate the previous one
2382000	2386000	That is, the time of this stream transmission mentioned earlier
2386000	2390000	Then finally get this new Modify model
2390000	2392000	When the ratio of the plant group is less than 1
2392000	2395000	We use the maximum flow rate of the flow field
2395000	2398000	To estimate the time of this stream transmission
2398000	2401000	Then finally we compare the theoretical model
2401000	2405000	The prediction and experiment data of the theoretical model
2405000	2408000	The left picture represents the case where the ratio is 1
2408000	2410000	The right picture is less than 1
2410000	2414000	Then the horizontal axis represents the strength of the water flow
2414000	2415000	The strength of the flow structure
2415000	2418000	Then the vertical axis represents the gas transmission
2418000	2419000	That is, the rate of oxidation
2419000	2421000	So the general trend is
2421000	2423000	The stronger the flow rate in the water
2423000	2425000	The faster the oxidation rate of the water table
2425000	2427000	But there is an interesting phenomenon here
2427000	2430000	We can find that in two cases
2430000	2433000	When the Reynolds number is less than a certain value
2433000	2437000	The rate of prediction of the entire model will be slower
2437000	2439000	It's slower, sorry
2439000	2443000	Then when the Reynolds number is greater than a certain value
2443000	2446000	The rate of prediction is shakier
2446000	2448000	Do you remember the beginning
2448000	2450000	I mentioned it when I introduced the flow
2450000	2452000	The so-called Reynolds number
2452000	2455000	It is a parameter used by scientists to describe how chaotic the flow field is
2455000	2458000	What about the range of different parameters?
2458000	2461000	It can describe whether the flow field is in the flow
2461000	2463000	Overflow or flow state
2463000	2465000	So this result tells us
2465000	2467000	What about the mechanism of the transmission of the entire surface of the gas
2467000	2469000	Will be affected by the flow state of the flow field
2469000	2472000	The flow state of the flow field is changed
2472000	2475000	So let's summarize
2475000	2478000	The whole study tells us a few points
2478000	2480000	That is, the technical message
2480000	2483000	The first point is through our research results
2483000	2485000	We can know the existence of aquatic plants
2485000	2487000	First of all, it will reduce the flow rate of water
2487000	2491000	But at the same time, it will also increase the structure of the flow in the water
2491000	2493000	Just make the water more chaotic
2493000	2496000	Then it leads to sedimentation, subsoil sedimentation, whirlpool
2496000	2499000	There is also an increase in the transmission rate of surface gas
2499000	2502000	In addition, we are based on different plant groups
2502000	2505000	The ratio of sedimentation and water flow interaction
2505000	2509000	The flow of this structure that produces different levels
2509000	2512000	We can propose a new physical model
2512000	2515000	Then consider the impact of aquatic plants
2515000	2517000	Then more precisely
2517000	2522000	To predict the mechanism of subsoil sedimentation and surface gas transmission
2522000	2524000	Then these information
2524000	2526000	We hope that in the future
2526000	2529000	It helps to assess more accurately
2529000	2531000	Ecology and the plan of aquatic engineering
2531000	2534000	With this whole image
2534000	2538000	It's 9.50 now
2538000	2541000	Generally speaking, the speech is about an hour
2541000	2543000	Is it?
2543000	2544000	Yes
2544000	2547000	OK, I should have a little time at the end
2547000	2549000	So I'll take this time
2549000	2552000	To share some other interesting things
2552000	2554000	During the PhD
2554000	2556000	In addition to the previously mentioned
2556000	2558000	Smaller aquatic plants
2558000	2560000	We are also using larger aquatic plants
2560000	2563000	Like this kind of aquatic plants to do experiments
2563000	2565000	Then we set the density to be higher
2565000	2567000	Then the number of more aquatic plants
2567000	2571000	To explore the structure of the water flow and the problem of gas exchange at a larger scale
2571000	2573000	I hope that we can discuss
2573000	2577000	The physical model proposed by the previous small-density experiment
2577000	2579000	Is it the same
2579000	2581000	Suitable for larger environments
2581000	2583000	After all, because our ultimate goal
2583000	2585000	Is to apply this model
2585000	2589000	To the real-world environment of rivers and lakes
2589000	2591000	Because we also know that experiments
2591000	2593000	Always simplify
2593000	2595000	The phenomenon of the whole natural world
2595000	2598000	So if you can make your scale bigger
2598000	2600000	Then make it closer to the natural world
2600000	2603000	It means that your model will be more convincing
2603000	2605000	Yes, of course, we also hope
2605000	2608000	Is that there can be some limited measurement data
2608000	2610000	Then compare it with the data we experimented
2610000	2615000	Then expand the range of the whole model
2615000	2618000	To the scale of the real field
2620000	2622000	In addition, we also found
2622000	2625000	Is that the position of the plant group
2625000	2627000	In fact, it will also affect the whole
2627000	2630000	The transmission of geothermal sand and the evolution of the terrain
2630000	2632000	Like the image on the upper right
2632000	2635000	The pillar is randomly placed
2636000	2638000	Then the pillar at the bottom right is regular
2638000	2640000	Is what we call staggered
2640000	2642000	This kind of regular placement
2642000	2644000	Then we compare the two videos
2644000	2646000	It can be clearly found that
2646000	2648000	When the pillar is randomly placed
2648000	2650000	The bottom bed will flow like a wave
2650000	2653000	It's like a wave
2653000	2655000	But when the pillar is placed in a regular way
2655000	2657000	The bottom bed changes
2657000	2659000	But it doesn't evolve like the wave above
2659000	2661000	It's just a layer of sand
2661000	2664000	It's just a continuous downward transmission
2665000	2667000	Then the other is the video on the left
2667000	2670000	It shows that the sand particles
2670000	2672000	Is that it follows
2672000	2675000	The flow structure produced by the plant in the water
2675000	2677000	There are different modes of movement
2677000	2679000	Like some of them
2679000	2682000	We can see that it is going down along the whole bottom bed
2682000	2685000	Some of them are what we call saltation
2685000	2687000	It's a bouncing transmission
2687000	2690000	Then some of them are directly suspended
2690000	2692000	Then take it along the water
2692000	2694000	In fact, these are all very interesting
2694000	2696000	More basic physical problems
2696000	2698000	Some scientists are also discussing
2698000	2700000	Particles
2700000	2702000	How is it in the fluid
2702000	2704000	With the flow of different structures
2704000	2706000	To move
2706000	2708000	These basic problems
2713000	2715000	Then during my doctoral class
2715000	2717000	I was very lucky to participate
2717000	2719000	In addition to aquatic plants
2719000	2721000	We also discussed
2721000	2723000	I just mentioned a question
2723000	2725000	In addition to discussing plants
2725000	2727000	Also discuss the flow of water
2727000	2729000	The impact of another aquatic plant
2729000	2731000	That is fish
2731000	2733000	So the origin of the whole plan
2733000	2735000	Let me introduce you a little bit
2735000	2737000	The origin of the whole plan
2737000	2739000	Because of the West Coast of the United States
2739000	2741000	The current ecology
2741000	2743000	Is seriously affected by foreign species
2743000	2745000	That foreign species is Asian carp
2745000	2747000	Asian carp
2747000	2749000	Asian carp basically
2749000	2751000	Midwestern
2751000	2753000	There is no land
2753000	2755000	So they react very quickly
2755000	2757000	Then it will harm
2757000	2759000	Some local species
2759000	2761000	So some biologists in the United States
2761000	2763000	They want to try to use
2763000	2765000	Natural law
2765000	2767000	To naturally reduce the reaction of Asian carp
2767000	2769000	Instead of just going straight
2769000	2771000	Because now
2771000	2773000	Basically advocate the so-called
2773000	2775000	Natural process
2775000	2777000	On the way
2777000	2779000	Cooperate with biologists
2779000	2781000	In the U.S. Geological Survey
2781000	2783000	Is to put real fish eggs
2783000	2785000	To our aquatic plants
2785000	2787000	Then our aquatic plants
2787000	2789000	This time the aquatic plants are used
2789000	2791000	We call it Turbulence Tank
2791000	2793000	It is a
2793000	2795000	About one meter by one meter
2795000	2797000	Then we can see
2797000	2799000	There is an iron grid
2799000	2801000	Then there is a motor above
2801000	2803000	Can control the vibration of this grid
2803000	2805000	Then through this vibration
2805000	2807000	Different intensity of turbulence
2807000	2809000	Then we can see
2809000	2811000	When I know different turbulence
2811000	2813000	What is the survival rate of these fish eggs
2813000	2815000	Because we know
2815000	2817000	The stronger the turbulence
2817000	2819000	Basically speaking, the film of the fish egg
2819000	2821000	It is very likely to be destroyed
2821000	2823000	Basically their hatching rate will be lower
2823000	2825000	So we do this
2825000	2827000	Do this experiment
2827000	2829000	To explore
2829000	2831000	What is the survival rate
2831000	2833000	Based on different scales or different intensities
2833000	2835000	This kind of turbulence
2835000	2837000	Then provide some biologists
2837000	2839000	Some insight to do some ecological work
2841000	2843000	Then we also set different structures
2843000	2845000	Like a stone
2845000	2847000	To simulate the flow of different environmental water
2847000	2849000	Then we
2849000	2851000	The research here is for
2851000	2853000	Just hatched
2853000	2855000	Larvae
2855000	2857000	Then there is the fish egg that I just mentioned
2857000	2859000	Then look at
2859000	2861000	When there is a stone and then there is a stream
2861000	2863000	When it flows
2863000	2865000	These larvae
2865000	2867000	What kind of place do they like to stay
2867000	2869000	From here
2869000	2871000	We can clearly see
2871000	2873000	There are two large parts
2873000	2875000	One part is at the top
2875000	2877000	The other part is behind the stone
2877000	2879000	Mainly because behind the stone
2879000	2881000	Basically it flows slower
2881000	2883000	So those larvae
2883000	2885000	If you stay here
2885000	2887000	Will be safer
2887000	2889000	Then basically its survival rate will be higher
2889000	2891000	If it is higher
2891000	2893000	The place above
2893000	2895000	It basically flows straight down
2895000	2897000	But it is less
2897000	2899000	It's just above the stone
2899000	2901000	Because here is basically
2901000	2903000	We just mentioned
2903000	2905000	Like the turbulence of Caton-Piscot
2907000	2909000	In addition to the larvae
2909000	2911000	We also do adult fish
2911000	2913000	Do adult fish
2913000	2915000	Research on the reaction of different flow factors
2915000	2917000	In the video
2917000	2919000	We set up a
2919000	2921000	Just a bigger pillar
2921000	2923000	Then we can find that most of the time
2923000	2925000	This fish
2925000	2927000	He would prefer to stay behind this column
2927000	2929000	Can be broadcast again
2929000	2931000	Then we can see
2931000	2933000	This fish will follow
2933000	2935000	Is the tail of our pillar
2935000	2937000	This tail
2937000	2939000	And then basically
2939000	2941000	It's like this
2941000	2943000	It can save its swimming energy
2943000	2945000	Then
2945000	2947000	Basically what we are doing here
2947000	2949000	Are some more preliminary research
2949000	2951000	In the future
2951000	2953000	Of course, more experiments are needed
2953000	2955000	To do further research
2955000	2957000	Under various flow conditions
2957000	2959000	Beneficial to the environment of fish
2959000	2961000	And then
2961000	2963000	To better predict the ecology of fish
2963000	2965000	And development
2965000	2967000	During my Ph.D.
2967000	2969000	I am more fortunate to participate in these
2969000	2971000	Quite interesting
2971000	2973000	Different
2973000	2975000	Biological-related topics
2975000	2977000	I think
2977000	2979000	The time should be almost
2979000	2981000	So
2981000	2983000	Thank you
2983000	2985000	My advisor during my Ph.D.
2985000	2987000	Then there is my whole
2987000	2989000	Research group at UIUC
2989000	2991000	Then basically my funding is from
2991000	2993000	My boss NSF's plan
2993000	2995000	Then there is Taiwan and UIUC
2995000	2997000	Joint fellowship
2997000	2999000	That's the last
2999000	3001000	Q&A time
3001000	3003000	See if you have any questions
3003000	3005000	Then I am also happy to
3005000	3007000	Share more
3007000	3009000	Information to everyone
3009000	3011000	If you are
3011000	3013000	Environmental science or even ecology
3013000	3015000	If you are interested in water resources
3015000	3017000	You are welcome to contact me
3017000	3019000	Ok then
3019000	3021000	That's it
3021000	3023000	Oh, before everyone
3023000	3025000	Before asking questions
3025000	3027000	Please turn on the microphone
3027000	3029000	Then we applaud again
3029000	3031000	Thank you for bringing us
3031000	3033000	Today's wonderful speech
3033000	3035000	Thank you
3035000	3037000	Ok
3037000	3039000	Then welcome everyone to ask questions
3039000	3041000	You can directly turn on the microphone to ask questions
3041000	3043000	Or type in the chat
3043000	3045000	Or there is an icon next to it
3055000	3057000	Then
3057000	3059000	Let me ask a question first
3059000	3061000	I am for
3061000	3063000	Implement this model
3063000	3065000	You are a little curious
3065000	3067000	Just because
3067000	3069000	After all, every river is different
3069000	3071000	Or you design an experiment
3071000	3073000	The size of his tank
3073000	3075000	Should be
3075000	3077000	I hope it will be much bigger than you
3077000	3079000	Implement this
3079000	3081000	Analytical model
3081000	3083000	So it will
3083000	3085000	Like a river
3085000	3087000	You won't make this thing
3087000	3089000	Small to
3089000	3091000	H2O molecule
3091000	3093000	Then you mentioned in it
3093000	3095000	You will judge that there are plants here
3095000	3097000	No plants here
3097000	3099000	How far is the plant from the water
3099000	3101000	So I may not catch it
3101000	3103000	But my guess is
3103000	3105000	This length scale
3105000	3107000	It's probably the same as the plant
3107000	3109000	Is it about the same size?
3111000	3113000	Basically my scale
3113000	3115000	It should be a plant group
3115000	3117000	So it's not just a group
3117000	3119000	A group of plants
3119000	3121000	So basically it should be
3123000	3125000	Because my experiment is basically
3125000	3127000	Your plant
3127000	3129000	There must be no way to implement
3129000	3131000	It's as much as reality
3131000	3133000	It must be a
3133000	3135000	Limited situation
3135000	3137000	But it should be noted that
3137000	3139000	Because my tank is basically limited in size
3139000	3141000	So I can think of it as
3141000	3143000	A scale dump
3143000	3145000	Physical model
3145000	3147000	So I'm on both sides here
3147000	3149000	Basically belong to a
3149000	3151000	Average scale
3151000	3153000	So you can think of it
3153000	3155000	As a plant group
3155000	3157000	For example
3157000	3159000	This experiment
3159000	3161000	You can think of it as a
3161000	3163000	Very small river
3163000	3165000	And there are these plants in it
3167000	3169000	Like I just mentioned
3169000	3171000	How can I make sure
3171000	3173000	I'm here
3173000	3175000	This thing
3175000	3177000	Can really be applied
3177000	3179000	In fact, there is still a gap between this
3179000	3181000	Because
3181000	3183000	In practice
3183000	3185000	It must be a simplified model
3185000	3187000	There are actually a lot of
3187000	3189000	Empirical parameters
3189000	3191000	But these parameters
3191000	3193000	For us experimentalists
3193000	3195000	This parameter is all inside
3195000	3197000	It means we
3197000	3199000	Physical based model
3199000	3201000	Because basically
3201000	3203000	Although my river is bigger
3203000	3205000	But it still follows the same
3205000	3207000	Fluid mechanics mechanism
3207000	3209000	But my empirical coefficient may be different
3209000	3211000	But I can make sure
3211000	3213000	My model
3213000	3215000	If it is based on this physics
3215000	3217000	Then my river will also
3217000	3219000	Follow this mechanism
3219000	3221000	So this is what I just mentioned
3221000	3223000	We hope to be able to do
3223000	3225000	Larger model
3225000	3227000	How much is the difference between this
3227000	3229000	Empirical coefficient
3229000	3231000	With my small river
3231000	3233000	Then if we have
3233000	3235000	Some limited measurements
3235000	3237000	We can be more clear
3237000	3239000	The curve of this empirical model
3239000	3241000	Then these things
3241000	3243000	Can actually be used as
3243000	3245000	A numerical simulation
3245000	3247000	Because basically
3247000	3249000	We have to do more
3249000	3251000	There must be no way
3251000	3253000	So we have to rely on simulation
3253000	3255000	There must be someone
3255000	3257000	Challenging
3257000	3259000	How can you ensure
3259000	3261000	The result of my simulation
3261000	3263000	With real experiments
3263000	3265000	Or the real environment is the same
3265000	3267000	So at this time
3267000	3269000	You have to rely on experimental validity
3269000	3271000	Then give it some useful parameters
3271000	3273000	Let it do more
3273000	3275000	Prediction
3275000	3277000	Correct
3277000	3279000	I don't know if I answered your question
3279000	3281000	Basically part of the answer
3281000	3283000	Answered my second question
3283000	3285000	My first question is completely answered
3285000	3287000	My next question is actually
3287000	3289000	If you want to put your model today
3289000	3291000	Throw in a simulation
3291000	3293000	Then for example, I will
3293000	3295000	Simulate a river
3295000	3297000	Is there such a plan?
3297000	3299000	Which one is safer to do experiments?
3299000	3301000	You have a plan to take data
3301000	3303000	Then compare
3303000	3305000	Simulation
3305000	3307000	My previous group is currently
3307000	3309000	No
3309000	3311000	Because my previous group is basically
3311000	3313000	Mainly focused on aquaculture experiments
3313000	3315000	But we have
3315000	3317000	Other schools are talking about cooperation
3317000	3319000	Some other schools
3319000	3321000	Their group
3321000	3323000	Their strong point
3323000	3325000	Is doing limited survey
3325000	3327000	Then they may be near the school
3327000	3329000	There is one
3329000	3331000	There may be a similar type of river in the campus
3331000	3333000	Then they may
3333000	3335000	Use that river as a sample
3335000	3337000	Then go there to pick up points
3337000	3339000	Want to compare with our experiment
3339000	3341000	Then basically
3341000	3343000	Simulation now
3343000	3345000	Is already
3345000	3347000	It's amazing to calculate
3347000	3349000	Complex
3349000	3351000	Fluid problem, but it still has a limit
3351000	3353000	I just talked about it
3353000	3355000	Completely
3355000	3357000	Copy the real situation
3357000	3359000	Especially aquaculture
3359000	3361000	How do you put
3361000	3363000	Aquaculture
3363000	3365000	Implement to your model
3365000	3367000	So this is why
3367000	3369000	I just said that we can provide useful parameters
3369000	3371000	So basically
3371000	3373000	I just mentioned that aquaculture has two main
3373000	3375000	One is to reduce flow
3375000	3377000	So it will provide a drag
3377000	3379000	Then that drag
3379000	3381000	I can give it a drag coefficient
3381000	3383000	Then the other one is that my aquaculture will produce a flow
3383000	3385000	What about the flow
3385000	3387000	You can also give it another parameter
3387000	3389000	Then throw these two parameters
3389000	3391000	Into my numerical simulation
3391000	3393000	I can go through
3393000	3395000	Actually
3395000	3397000	Build a grid
3397000	3399000	Build these vegetation
3399000	3401000	I can do parameterization
3401000	3403000	To get close results
3403000	3405000	This is the current
3405000	3407000	I know numerical model
3407000	3409000	What they are doing
3409000	3411000	So they still need
3411000	3413000	This data we experimented
3413000	3415000	To give them useful parameters
3415000	3417000	Then let them do simulation
3417000	3419000	I understand
3419000	3421000	I think it's very interesting
3421000	3423000	Do you have any other questions
3423000	3425000	I have a question
3425000	3427000	Yes
3427000	3429000	Actually I'm curious
3429000	3431000	What you will do in
3431000	3433000	Aquaculture
3433000	3435000	Because you will
3435000	3437000	You will do numerical simulation in aquaculture
3437000	3439000	Related things
3439000	3441000	I should do simulation
3441000	3443000	Yes
3443000	3445000	Then your simulation
3445000	3447000	Actually I have a follow-up
3447000	3449000	Previous question
3449000	3451000	You talked about
3451000	3453000	You are in the system
3453000	3455000	You will have a
3455000	3457000	Similar
3457000	3459000	Basically you see yourself
3459000	3461000	Average scale
3461000	3463000	In fact, many simulation methods
3463000	3465000	Will use multi-scale
3465000	3467000	You may have different
3467000	3469000	Dynamics
3469000	3471000	Dynamics
3471000	3473000	But you
3473000	3475000	May look at the problem
3475000	3477000	I don't know
3477000	3479000	In aquaculture
3479000	3481000	Multi-scale simulation
3481000	3483000	How far
3483000	3485000	This question is very good
3485000	3487000	I answer first
3487000	3489000	What I want to do in aquaculture
3489000	3491000	Basically I should be in aquaculture
3491000	3493000	Do simulation
3493000	3495000	Because there is a good
3495000	3497000	Calculation computation resources
3497000	3499000	But I may
3499000	3501000	Sorry
3501000	3503000	I may not continue
3503000	3505000	I should not continue to do experiments
3505000	3507000	Because they seem to be there
3507000	3509000	As far as I know, there is no experimental equipment
3509000	3511000	Yes
3511000	3513000	As for doing simulation
3513000	3515000	I'm not sure if I can do aquaculture simulation
3515000	3517000	I'm still
3517000	3519000	Because I just uploaded
3519000	3521000	So I still don't know
3521000	3523000	Not yet
3523000	3525000	Future topic
3525000	3527000	But about you just mentioned
3527000	3529000	Multi-scale problem
3529000	3531000	Because basically I
3531000	3533000	I used to have similar experiences
3533000	3535000	In fact, doing
3535000	3537000	Simulation of aquaculture
3537000	3539000	A very important problem is that I just mentioned
3539000	3541000	Turbulence model
3541000	3543000	Because Turbulence is basically very small
3543000	3545000	So if I want to be precise
3545000	3547000	To
3547000	3549000	I want to be precise to simulate this
3549000	3551000	Turbulence flow
3551000	3553000	My grid must be thin enough
3553000	3555000	The result of the physics I came out
3555000	3557000	Physics
3557000	3559000	Meaning
3559000	3561000	But there is a problem
3561000	3563000	My grid must be very thin
3563000	3565000	But if I have to do like
3565000	3567000	Large-scale simulation
3567000	3569000	I can't have so much resources
3569000	3571000	Because I want to be very thin and I have to
3571000	3573000	Really big domain
3573000	3575000	Then my computation cost is very large
3575000	3577000	So
3577000	3579000	They will do some of the parameters I just mentioned
3579000	3581000	Process
3581000	3583000	When I have a small AD
3583000	3585000	How will my AD affect the flow
3585000	3587000	Then it may affect its drag
3587000	3589000	It may affect the flow of energy
3589000	3591000	Then I use this
3591000	3593000	Parameterization to give
3593000	3595000	To the large scale model
3595000	3597000	To do simulation
3597000	3599000	Then I can skip the small scale simulation
3599000	3601000	Directly use large scale
3601000	3603000	Then you just talked about multi-scale
3603000	3605000	Now there is indeed
3605000	3607000	Because some people found out
3607000	3609000	I'll go back to a picture
3611000	3613000	I mentioned it earlier
3613000	3615000	I remember there is a picture
3615000	3617000	Is in
3617000	3619000	Wait a minute
3619000	3621000	Find it
3625000	3627000	This
3633000	3635000	OK this
3635000	3637000	We can see
3637000	3639000	I just mentioned
3639000	3641000	Most of the rivers
3641000	3643000	The flow is at the bottom
3643000	3645000	Because the friction of the bottom bed
3645000	3647000	This is produced by the gravity
3647000	3649000	So the flow here is very strong
3649000	3651000	Now the scientists have found
3651000	3653000	I just use the parameterization process
3653000	3655000	To do the whole river
3655000	3657000	Simulation may have some errors
3657000	3659000	Because if they
3659000	3661000	Want to see more detailed things
3661000	3663000	In the bottom part of the bed, they use large scale
3663000	3665000	Basically your grid is too thick
3665000	3667000	The things you see
3667000	3669000	It must not be thin enough
3669000	3671000	They are doing multi-scale
3671000	3673000	They put the bottom bed
3673000	3675000	The grid is very thin
3675000	3677000	Then I can solve it
3677000	3679000	Really solve this
3679000	3681000	The flow of air
3681000	3683000	But what about the grid above me
3683000	3685000	I know their flow is not strong
3685000	3687000	So they can directly use
3687000	3689000	Parameterization to transmit
3689000	3691000	So just do it
3691000	3693000	To merge
3693000	3695000	There is indeed such a
3695000	3697000	Simulation
3697000	3699000	In fact, this can also be applied to the atmosphere
3699000	3701000	Because if you want to do the boundary layer
3701000	3703000	Is that I am far away
3703000	3705000	The atmosphere on the surface
3705000	3707000	Basically they are doing
3707000	3709000	Large AD Simulation
3709000	3711000	So they are not solving
3711000	3713000	They are also a parameterization process
3713000	3715000	Then it's not really solving
3715000	3717000	Very close to the surface
3717000	3719000	But if they want to see
3719000	3721000	For example, these urban buildings
3721000	3723000	The shape of these currents
3723000	3725000	They may put
3725000	3727000	The grid inside is very thin
3727000	3729000	Then rely on parameters
3729000	3731000	To transmit this information from the bottom bed
3731000	3733000	From the bottom to the top
3737000	3739000	I don't know if I have answered your question
3739000	3741000	But this question is very good
3741000	3743000	It is indeed the current scientists
3743000	3745000	Especially
3745000	3747000	People doing application math
3747000	3749000	What are you doing
3749000	3751000	Because they are good at doing some
3751000	3753000	Network grid
3753000	3755000	Network grid information
3755000	3757000	There is no problem
3761000	3763000	I don't know if anyone else has any questions
3771000	3773000	If there is no problem
3773000	3775000	I am the host of today's speech
3775000	3777000	Let's talk a little bit
3777000	3779000	Is in the chat part
