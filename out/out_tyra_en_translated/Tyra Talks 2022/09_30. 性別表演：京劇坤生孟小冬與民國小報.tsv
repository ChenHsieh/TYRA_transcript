67000	75000	Today's topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.
75000	78000	Let's welcome Yang Yun-Pu.
78000	80000	Thank you, everyone.
80000	85000	I will now share my first video.
85000	89000	Here it is.
89000	93000	I think everyone can see it now.
93000	97000	My topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.
97000	104000	I am currently a Ph.D. candidate, so I am currently writing my paper.
104000	108000	This topic is one of my papers.
108000	114000	In today's presentation, I will divide it into two parts.
114000	122000	In the first part, I will briefly introduce Meng Xiaodong, her performance style, her personal life, and her marriage.
122000	130000	In the second part, I will focus on how the public views Meng Xiaodong.
130000	136000	I will also talk about how the New York Times interpreted Meng Xiaodong from the 1920s to the 1950s.
136000	140000	Meng Xiaodong is a very special actress.
140000	150000	In the U.S., sexual harassment, sexual violence, and death are all very sensitive topics.
150000	152000	So, trigger warning.
152000	160000	Later, we will talk about topics related to sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual violence, and death.
160000	162000	Everyone should be mentally prepared.
162000	166000	This is Meng Xiaodong, who I will introduce today.
166000	170000	Meng Xiaodong was born in 1908 and passed away in 1977.
170000	176000	If I remember correctly, she was born in Shanghai in 1908.
176000	182000	In 1977, she moved to Taiwan and settled down in Taiwan.
182000	187000	When she passed away, she was buried in a cemetery in Taipei.
187000	191000	I remember that someone on the Internet shared the location of the grave.
191000	193000	If you are interested, you can go and take a look.
194000	199000	Meng Xiaodong is a very well-known female veteran in the entertainment industry.
199000	204000	A veteran is someone who plays a male role on stage.
204000	206000	There are many types of male roles.
206000	210000	In short, a veteran is a mature male.
210000	215000	Meng Xiaodong is very famous for being a very good veteran.
215000	219000	We call female veterans.
219000	224000	There is a very important concept that I want to emphasize.
224000	230000	It is easy to say that if a man plays a female role on stage or a woman plays a male role on stage,
230000	232000	we generally say that this is a backstabbing.
232000	236000	But in the play, the meaning of backstabbing is not like this at all.
236000	244000	The meaning of backstabbing is that, for example, Meng Xiaodong has been a veteran since childhood.
244000	247000	One day, he suddenly played a female role on stage.
247000	250000	This is called backstabbing.
250000	255000	If he plays a male role on stage, this is called the job of the job.
255000	258000	The job is the job of the job in Japan.
258000	260000	The job is the job of the job in Japan.
260000	267000	So don't mix up the backstabbing concept of the stage with the backstabbing in the play.
267000	270000	Another example is Mei Lanfang.
270000	273000	Mei Lanfang is a very famous veteran actor.
273000	276000	So when we talk about Mei Lanfang,
276000	279000	we don't say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.
279000	284000	We say that Mei Lanfang uses her job to perform.
284000	287000	But if Mei Lanfang plays a man on stage today,
287000	290000	we will say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.
290000	293000	I hope this part can be clarified.
293000	296000	Meng Xiaodong's very famous part,
296000	308000	I think it's still the best backstabbing woman in history.
308000	311000	You may ask what kind of backstabbing woman is backstabbing woman.
311000	314000	Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.
314000	317000	Backstabbing woman is Yu Shuyan.
317000	320000	Yu Shuyan is the person in the middle.
320000	322000	She is the founder of backstabbing woman.
322000	325000	She was born in 1890 to 1943.
325000	328000	Yu Shuyan has a very high status in the old generation.
328000	331000	To this day, many Beijing opera actors
331000	334000	still say that they are learning from the Yu family.
334000	337000	They think she is a teacher of the Yu family.
337000	339000	They think she is a legend.
339000	342000	A legend that cannot be surpassed.
342000	345000	People like Yu Shuyan are proud all their lives.
345000	348000	She has only received two students.
348000	351000	We say that sometimes other young actors
351000	353000	may have learned one or two plays from her.
353000	356000	But they are not formal backstabbing women.
356000	359000	Formal backstabbing women are those who kowtow to her,
359000	362000	kneel down to her, and give her gifts.
362000	365000	All famous actors come to witness
365000	368000	this kind of formal backstabbing women.
368000	370000	We say that she is a real disciple.
370000	373000	She has received two real disciples in her life.
373000	375000	One male and one female.
375000	377000	The male is Li Shaochun, the one on the left.
377000	379000	He is also very famous.
379000	381000	The female is Meng Xiaodong.
381000	383000	Interestingly,
383000	388000	according to Chinese culture,
388000	391000	especially in the era of the Republic of China,
391000	393000	where men and women are very important,
393000	396000	or in the Qing Dynasty, where men and women were very important,
396000	398000	it is very interesting that
398000	400000	people generally think that Meng Xiaodong
400000	403000	is a person who has really been passed down by the Yu family.
403000	405000	Because Li Shaochun was too busy.
405000	407000	Li Shaochun had a family to support.
407000	410000	So whoever asked him to act, he did.
410000	412000	Making money is the most important thing.
412000	414000	Yu Shuyuan is a very serious person.
414000	416000	She is very...
416000	418000	I don't think it's natural.
418000	420000	I didn't teach you how to act.
420000	422000	You act as Sun Wukong every day.
422000	424000	Aren't you embarrassing me?
424000	426000	Meng Xiaodong is different.
426000	428000	Meng Xiaodong,
428000	430000	we will talk about her marriage later.
430000	432000	Basically, when she studied with Yu Shuyuan,
432000	434000	she was single.
434000	436000	So she didn't have a family to support.
436000	438000	She also had more time
438000	440000	to study with Yu Shuyuan.
440000	442000	So in the end, people actually think that
442000	444000	the person who really
444000	446000	got Yu Shuyuan's love
446000	448000	and was able to learn from Yu Shuyuan
448000	450000	was Meng Xiaodong,
450000	452000	not Li Shaochun.
454000	456000	We will also talk about Meng Xiaodong's marriage.
456000	458000	The one on the left
458000	460000	is when Meng Xiaodong was 19
460000	462000	and married Mei Lanfang.
462000	464000	The one on the right is Mei Lanfang.
464000	466000	So the existence of this
466000	468000	little phoenix
468000	470000	became a very interesting topic
470000	472000	for gossip magazines at the time.
472000	474000	They thought that
474000	476000	the girl's eyes were female,
476000	478000	and the man's eyes were male.
478000	480000	The relationship between
480000	482000	the two sexes
482000	484000	made gossip magazines very popular.
484000	486000	At that time, Mei Lanfang
486000	488000	was already a very famous star.
488000	490000	A popular entertainment star.
490000	492000	But later,
492000	494000	she divorced Mei Lanfang
494000	496000	when she was
496000	498000	in her late thirties.
500000	502000	She married another man,
502000	504000	an old man.
504000	506000	This old man may not look
506000	508000	very good,
508000	510000	but don't think it's nothing.
510000	512000	Because this old man
512000	514000	is actually a very famous
514000	516000	young man in Shanghai
516000	518000	from the 1920s to the 1950s.
518000	520000	His name is Du Yuesheng.
520000	522000	In simple terms,
522000	524000	Du Yuesheng is a very famous
524000	526000	and high-ranking gangster.
526000	528000	Meng Xiaodong became his
528000	530000	fifth wife.
530000	532000	This photo
532000	534000	is of Meng Xiaodong
534000	536000	when he played the role of
536000	538000	Qing Dingzhu.
542000	544000	Before we talk more
544000	546000	about Meng Xiaodong's story,
546000	548000	I also hope to find
548000	550000	a small part of his
550000	552000	recording and let everyone
552000	554000	feel his singing.
554000	556000	But this singing
556000	558000	is not a very formal
558000	560000	recording.
560000	562000	In the 1950s and 1960s,
562000	564000	he lived in Hong Kong for a while.
564000	566000	When he lived in Hong Kong,
566000	568000	he recorded at home
568000	570000	when he invited
570000	572000	his piano teacher.
572000	574000	So there will be a lot of noise.
574000	576000	Please, Pei Xun, play it for us.
580000	582000	Do you have a way to play it?
640000	642000	Yes, I do.
670000	672000	Do you have a way to play it?
672000	674000	Yes, I do.
700000	702000	Do you have a way to play it?
702000	704000	Yes, I do.
730000	759000	Thank you.
759000	769000	I want to share the screen again.
769000	777000	Thank you.
777000	803000	This is a simple yearbook.
803000	807000	This amazing actress,
807000	809000	when she was 40,
809000	811000	it was her last time on stage.
811000	813000	After that,
813000	815000	no one saw her perform.
815000	817000	When she was 43,
817000	819000	she married Du Yuesheng,
819000	821000	who we just talked about,
821000	823000	the boss of the underworld.
823000	825000	A year later,
825000	827000	Du Yuesheng passed away.
827000	829000	Du Yuesheng was seriously ill at the time.
829000	831000	In the 1960s,
831000	833000	she moved to Taiwan.
833000	835000	She lived in Taiwan for a few years
835000	837000	and then passed away.
837000	839000	This is a very brief yearbook.
839000	843000	It's a brief overview of her life.
843000	845000	Before I talk more about
845000	847000	her relationship
847000	849000	with the gossip magazine,
849000	851000	I want to provide you
851000	853000	some background information.
853000	855000	In the 1970s,
855000	857000	the competition
857000	859000	between genders
859000	861000	was very interesting.
861000	863000	In the 1970s,
863000	865000	there were only male actors
865000	867000	on the stage.
867000	869000	From 1970 to 1870,
869000	871000	there were only male actors
871000	873000	on the stage.
873000	875000	On the stage,
875000	877000	no matter what the role was,
877000	879000	it was all played by men.
879000	881000	It wasn't until 1870
881000	883000	that some female actors
883000	885000	joined the industry.
885000	887000	Although some female actors
887000	889000	joined the industry,
889000	891000	in the society at the time,
891000	893000	there was always a
893000	895000	discrimination
895000	897000	between actors and prostitutes.
897000	899000	We can't say
899000	901000	it was discrimination.
901000	903000	In the 1970s,
903000	905000	1870s,
905000	907000	and especially 1920s,
907000	909000	we could see
909000	911000	that some female actors
911000	913000	were already famous.
915000	917000	They were good at singing and dancing
917000	919000	and acting,
919000	921000	so they switched to acting.
921000	923000	We could also see
923000	925000	that some female actors
925000	927000	were also taking classes
927000	929000	other than acting.
929000	931000	This was partly true,
931000	933000	but it was also
933000	935000	a problem
935000	937000	for some actors.
939000	941000	In this speech,
941000	943000	I'd like to bring you
943000	945000	to think about these questions.
945000	947000	First,
947000	949000	let's take a look at
949000	951000	how the gossip
951000	953000	from 1920s to 1950s
953000	955000	influenced
955000	957000	Meng Xiaodong
957000	959000	and how their
959000	961000	views on Meng Xiaodong
961000	963000	changed.
963000	965000	Second,
965000	967000	I'd like to discuss
967000	969000	how Meng Xiaodong
969000	971000	was full of
971000	973000	sexism.
973000	975000	I don't know
975000	977000	if you know what sexism is.
977000	979000	To put it simply,
979000	981000	sexism is
981000	983000	when a person's gender
983000	985000	is highlighted.
985000	987000	For example,
987000	989000	Meng Xiaodong is a girl.
989000	991000	There are a lot of gossip
991000	993000	about Meng Xiaodong's
993000	995000	gender.
995000	997000	Later,
997000	999000	we'll have
999000	1001000	more practical examples.
1001000	1003000	So, I'd like to discuss
1003000	1005000	how Meng Xiaodong
1005000	1007000	exercised his autonomy
1007000	1009000	to resist the sexism
1009000	1011000	and misogyny of the gossip.
1011000	1013000	Third,
1013000	1015000	let's take a look
1015000	1017000	at how Meng Xiaodong
1017000	1019000	finally found
1019000	1021000	a solution
1021000	1023000	to help himself
1023000	1025000	from the gossip.
1025000	1027000	Lastly,
1027000	1029000	I'd like to discuss
1029000	1031000	how Meng Xiaodong
1031000	1033000	is a legendary actress
1033000	1035000	and is considered
1035000	1037000	to be the best
1037000	1039000	virgin in Chinese history.
1039000	1041000	However,
1041000	1043000	there are restrictions
1043000	1045000	on his status.
1045000	1047000	His status is not
1047000	1049000	100% perfect.
1049000	1051000	What are the restrictions?
1051000	1053000	First, let's take a look
1053000	1055000	at a 2020 report.
1055000	1057000	In 2020,
1057000	1059000	Meng Xiaodong was
1059000	1061000	around 10 years old.
1061000	1063000	I forgot.
1063000	1065000	He was 13 years old.
1065000	1067000	In the report,
1067000	1069000	he wrote that
1069000	1071000	he wouldn't be affected
1071000	1073000	by gossips until he was 16 or 17.
1073000	1075000	Gossips mean
1075000	1077000	his throat was damaged
1077000	1079000	or his voice changed
1079000	1081000	when he was 16 or 17.
1081000	1083000	He said he wouldn't be affected
1083000	1085000	by gossips until he was 16 or 17.
1085000	1087000	In the future,
1087000	1089000	gossips like
1089000	1091000	En Xiaofeng,
1091000	1093000	Xiao Lanying,
1093000	1095000	Chen Huifeng,
1095000	1097000	etc.
1097000	1099000	We can see
1099000	1101000	two things here.
1101000	1103000	First, the report
1103000	1105000	was highly anticipated.
1105000	1107000	Second,
1107000	1109000	Meng Xiaodong
1109000	1111000	was discussed with
1111000	1113000	other senior female students.
1113000	1115000	In the future,
1115000	1117000	female students
1117000	1119000	will discuss
1119000	1121000	Meng Xiaodong with
1121000	1123000	female students
1123000	1125000	and learn from him.
1125000	1127000	I just wanted to
1127000	1129000	show you
1129000	1131000	what the report looked like
1131000	1133000	at the time.
1133000	1135000	Most of my papers
1135000	1137000	are based on the report.
1137000	1139000	I read a lot of old newspapers.
1139000	1141000	That's what I read.
1143000	1145000	In 1926,
1145000	1147000	Meng Xiaodong was
1147000	1149000	living in Shanghai.
1149000	1151000	In 1926,
1151000	1153000	he decided to move to Beijing.
1153000	1155000	At that time,
1155000	1157000	people thought
1157000	1159000	Shanghai made a lot of money
1159000	1161000	but Beijing was a good place
1161000	1163000	for an actor.
1163000	1165000	However,
1165000	1167000	after he moved to Beijing,
1167000	1169000	Shanghai newspapers
1169000	1171000	still liked to report his gossips.
1171000	1173000	At that time,
1173000	1175000	there was no Internet,
1175000	1177000	so news could be verified.
1177000	1179000	Many fake news
1179000	1181000	like
1181000	1183000	Meng Xiaodong's suicide
1183000	1185000	were published.
1185000	1187000	Some
1187000	1189000	vulgar news
1189000	1191000	like this
1191000	1193000	were published.
1207000	1209000	When I read this news,
1209000	1211000	I was shocked.
1211000	1213000	I thought
1213000	1215000	people in the past
1215000	1217000	were not conservative.
1217000	1219000	They could write
1219000	1221000	what they wanted to say.
1221000	1223000	At that time,
1223000	1225000	there was a civil war.
1225000	1227000	Many military officials
1227000	1229000	took a fancy to Meng Xiaodong
1229000	1231000	and forced him
1231000	1233000	to move to his house.
1233000	1235000	Of course,
1235000	1237000	he didn't just
1237000	1239000	invite Meng Xiaodong to dinner.
1239000	1241000	He wanted to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.
1241000	1243000	He said
1243000	1245000	Meng Xiaodong
1245000	1247000	was not
1247000	1249000	his type.
1249000	1251000	He had sex with Meng Xiaodong
1251000	1253000	every day.
1253000	1255000	He felt
1255000	1257000	he was sick of it.
1257000	1259000	He even
1259000	1261000	forced his family
1261000	1263000	to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.
1263000	1265000	In the end,
1265000	1267000	Meng Xiaodong died
1267000	1269000	in this situation.
1269000	1271000	It was a very exaggerated news.
1271000	1273000	At the same time,
1273000	1275000	there were
1275000	1277000	similar news.
1277000	1279000	There were many
1279000	1281000	similar news.
1281000	1283000	For example,
1283000	1285000	let's look at
1285000	1287000	the following news.
1287000	1289000	Meng Xiaodong
1289000	1291000	was robbed
1291000	1293000	by a general.
1293000	1295000	They said
1295000	1297000	Meng Xiaodong
1297000	1299000	was too small
1299000	1301000	to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.
1301000	1303000	After the robbery,
1303000	1305000	Meng Xiaodong was locked up
1305000	1307000	by a general
1307000	1309000	and sent to
1309000	1311000	a hospital.
1311000	1313000	Meng Xiaodong's name
1313000	1315000	was used
1315000	1317000	to
1317000	1319000	show
1319000	1321000	the sexual behavior
1321000	1323000	between Meng Xiaodong
1323000	1325000	and the general.
1325000	1327000	The 87-yuan coin
1327000	1329000	was the
1329000	1331000	size of Meng Xiaodong's
1331000	1333000	sex organ.
1333000	1335000	The 87-yuan coin
1335000	1337000	was the size of Meng Xiaodong's
1337000	1339000	sex organ.
1339000	1341000	Meng Xiaodong was
1341000	1343000	robbed by a general
1343000	1345000	and had sex with Meng Xiaodong.
1345000	1347000	In the end,
1347000	1349000	Meng Xiaodong was sick
1349000	1351000	and sent to a hospital.
1351000	1353000	There were many
1353000	1355000	exaggerated news
1355000	1357000	about Meng Xiaodong.
1357000	1359000	As I said,
1359000	1361000	these news
1361000	1363000	constantly sexualized
1363000	1365000	Meng Xiaodong.
1365000	1367000	We call it
1367000	1369000	sexualization.
1369000	1371000	It emphasizes
1371000	1373000	Meng Xiaodong's gender
1373000	1375000	and sexual
1375000	1377000	behavior.
1379000	1381000	Of course,
1381000	1383000	some commentators
1383000	1385000	couldn't stand it.
1385000	1387000	For example,
1387000	1389000	Aowong
1389000	1391000	wrote many articles
1391000	1393000	about Meng Xiaodong.
1393000	1395000	He was a fan of Meng Xiaodong.
1395000	1397000	He was so surprised
1397000	1399000	that Meng Xiaodong
1399000	1401000	became a target
1401000	1403000	of gossip.
1403000	1405000	So,
1405000	1407000	Meng Xiaodong
1407000	1409000	should imitate an actor
1409000	1411000	and marry a rich man
1411000	1413000	as soon as possible.
1413000	1415000	Then, no one
1415000	1417000	would gossip about Meng Xiaodong.
1417000	1419000	At that time,
1419000	1421000	many actresses
1421000	1423000	thought
1423000	1425000	it was impossible
1425000	1427000	to show off on stage.
1427000	1429000	So,
1429000	1431000	Meng Xiaodong should find a time
1431000	1433000	to marry a rich man
1433000	1435000	and live a happy life.
1435000	1437000	He shouldn't show off anymore.
1437000	1439000	After all,
1439000	1441000	it's easy to be sexually harassed.
1441000	1443000	At that time,
1443000	1445000	people still thought
1445000	1447000	public women
1447000	1449000	were relatively
1449000	1451000	uncivilized.
1451000	1453000	For example,
1453000	1455000	prostitutes were
1455000	1457000	public women.
1457000	1459000	So were actresses.
1459000	1461000	I'd like to add
1461000	1463000	that
1463000	1465000	the idea of
1465000	1467000	public women
1467000	1469000	still exists
1469000	1471000	in the 60s, 70s,
1471000	1473000	and even in the 70s and 80s.
1473000	1475000	When I read
1475000	1477000	the records of Taiwanese actors,
1477000	1479000	I can see that
1479000	1481000	some actresses
1481000	1483000	are attracted by marriage
1483000	1485000	on the stage.
1485000	1487000	It's a common concept.
1487000	1489000	However,
1489000	1491000	it's not the case today.
1491000	1493000	As I said,
1493000	1495000	Meng Xiaodong was gossiped.
1495000	1497000	So,
1497000	1499000	Meng Xiaodong
1499000	1501000	moved to Beijing
1501000	1503000	and married
1503000	1505000	Mei Lanfang at the same time.
1505000	1507000	However,
1507000	1509000	it was well-hidden.
1509000	1511000	No one knew about it,
1511000	1513000	except close friends.
1513000	1515000	No one knew about it.
1515000	1517000	Let's talk about
1517000	1519000	Mei Lanfang's family.
1519000	1521000	Before Meng Xiaodong,
1521000	1523000	Mei Lanfang had two wives.
1523000	1525000	The first wife was Wang Minghua.
1525000	1527000	The second wife was
1527000	1529000	Fu Zhifang.
1529000	1531000	Fu Zhifang was also an actress.
1531000	1533000	I heard that Wang Minghua was also an actress.
1533000	1535000	However,
1535000	1537000	Wang Minghua passed away early.
1537000	1539000	So, I couldn't find his photo.
1539000	1541000	Fu Zhifang was also an actress.
1541000	1543000	Then,
1543000	1545000	she became the second wife of Mei Lanfang.
1545000	1547000	Wang Minghua didn't have children.
1549000	1551000	Then,
1551000	1553000	from
1553000	1555000	1926,
1555000	1557000	when Meng Xiaodong moved to Beijing,
1557000	1559000	and many gossips started to talk about him,
1559000	1561000	to 1929,
1561000	1563000	basically,
1563000	1565000	no one knew
1565000	1567000	about Meng Xiaodong's whereabouts,
1567000	1569000	suicide,
1569000	1571000	marriage,
1571000	1573000	or sexual abuse.
1573000	1575000	It was a maze.
1575000	1577000	You could find different stories in newspapers.
1577000	1579000	So,
1579000	1581000	until now,
1581000	1583000	for example,
1583000	1585000	this news report
1585000	1587000	was published in
1587000	1589000	1929,
1589000	1591000	and was published in
1591000	1593000	February, 1929.
1593000	1595000	They said that
1595000	1597000	they published
1597000	1599000	these four photos
1599000	1601000	and discussed
1601000	1603000	where Meng Xiaodong was,
1603000	1605000	who he was,
1605000	1607000	and what he said.
1607000	1609000	I'm afraid it's a problem,
1609000	1611000	but not a problem.
1611000	1613000	Some people said that
1613000	1615000	Mei Qi,
1615000	1617000	which means Mei Lanfang,
1617000	1619000	was about to give birth.
1619000	1621000	Mei Qi's son
1621000	1623000	used a mirror.
1623000	1625000	Then,
1625000	1627000	as you can see,
1627000	1629000	these four photos
1629000	1631000	were taken
1631000	1633000	from right to left
1634000	1636000	and ordered,
1636000	1638000	asking kiss
1638000	1640000	and being kissed by others.
1640000	1641000	They were also giving advice for
1641000	1643000	sister and Sister Ning.
1643000	1644000	So,
1644000	1645000	they published
1645000	1647000	gossips photos
1647000	1649000	to discuss where Meng Xiaodong was and
1649000	1651000	finding it very interesting.
1651000	1653000	We mentioned that
1653000	1655000	gossip reporters
1655000	1657000	always wanted to find Meng Xiaodong,
1657000	1659000	but at the same time,
1659000	1661000	how could these photos
1661000	1663000	be posted on Beiyang Newspaper?
1663000	1665000	Did they
1665000	1667000	deliberately
1667000	1669000	take photos of Meng Xiaodong?
1669000	1671000	We don't know.
1671000	1673000	At the same time,
1673000	1675000	on February 9th,
1675000	1677000	a few days later,
1677000	1679000	there was another photo.
1679000	1681000	This is a photo of Mei Lanfang.
1681000	1683000	On the right, it says,
1683000	1685000	What are you doing there?
1685000	1687000	On the left, it says,
1687000	1689000	I'm taking a photo here.
1689000	1691000	On the right,
1691000	1693000	it says,
1693000	1695000	This is a photo about
1695000	1697000	Mei Meng.
1697000	1699000	On the right,
1699000	1701000	it says,
1701000	1703000	Meng Xiaodong.
1703000	1705000	On the left, it says,
1705000	1707000	Mei Lanfang.
1707000	1709000	Do you think
1709000	1711000	these two words
1711000	1713000	are written by different people?
1713000	1715000	To me,
1715000	1717000	these two words
1717000	1719000	are used to discuss
1719000	1721000	the relationship between
1721000	1723000	Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong.
1725000	1727000	We say that
1727000	1729000	Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong
1729000	1731000	are getting closer
1731000	1733000	and getting married.
1733000	1735000	But
1735000	1737000	can they live a happy life?
1737000	1739000	Maybe not.
1739000	1741000	Because we just talked about
1741000	1743000	Mei Lanfang and two wives,
1743000	1745000	Wang Minghua,
1745000	1747000	and
1747000	1749000	Fu Zhifang.
1749000	1751000	Fu Zhifang is described as
1751000	1753000	a very jealous person.
1753000	1755000	I didn't live in that era.
1755000	1757000	I don't know them.
1757000	1759000	So I don't know if Fu Zhifang
1759000	1761000	is really jealous.
1761000	1763000	But the report said
1763000	1765000	Fu Zhifang regards Mei Lanfang
1765000	1767000	as his own
1767000	1769000	exclusive mate.
1769000	1771000	He doesn't allow
1771000	1773000	anyone to get close to Mei Lanfang.
1773000	1775000	Another report said
1775000	1777000	everyone
1777000	1779000	hopes that
1779000	1781000	Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong
1781000	1783000	can get back together.
1783000	1785000	At that time, there were a lot of gossips.
1785000	1787000	Some said they were divorced.
1787000	1789000	Some said they were together.
1789000	1791000	The report said
1791000	1793000	everyone wants Mei Lanfang
1793000	1795000	and Meng Xiaodong to be together.
1795000	1797000	They are a perfect couple.
1797000	1799000	But
1799000	1801000	Fu Zhifang doesn't want
1801000	1803000	them to be together.
1803000	1805000	Because he thinks
1805000	1807000	Mei Lanfang is his exclusive mate.
1807000	1809000	So he doesn't allow anyone
1809000	1811000	to get close to Mei Lanfang.
1811000	1813000	So
1813000	1815000	when these two
1815000	1817000	use exclusive mate
1817000	1819000	to describe Mei Lanfang,
1819000	1821000	it shows
1821000	1823000	that
1823000	1825000	in the drama,
1825000	1827000	in the sexual scenes,
1827000	1829000	the female actors' power is obviously weaker
1829000	1831000	and they are more likely to be harassed.
1831000	1833000	They are more likely to be sexually harassed.
1833000	1835000	They are more likely to be involved
1835000	1837000	in the gossips.
1837000	1839000	However,
1839000	1841000	in Mei Lanfang's home,
1841000	1843000	we can see another
1843000	1845000	sexual dynamic balance.
1845000	1847000	It's not as traditional
1847000	1849000	as we think.
1849000	1851000	It seems that
1851000	1853000	men have more power.
1853000	1855000	On the contrary,
1855000	1857000	Fu Zhifang seems to have more power.
1857000	1859000	Moreover,
1859000	1861000	when they
1861000	1863000	describe Mei Lanfang
1863000	1865000	as their exclusive mate,
1865000	1867000	it seems that
1867000	1869000	Mei Lanfang is also
1869000	1871000	being sexually harassed
1871000	1873000	by Fu Zhifang
1873000	1875000	as her exclusive mate.
1875000	1877000	They describe Mei Lanfang
1877000	1879000	as a piece of meat.
1879000	1881000	It's a piece of meat
1881000	1883000	that everyone wants.
1883000	1885000	So we can see
1885000	1887000	that Mei Lanfang is also
1887000	1889000	being sexually harassed by Fu Zhifang.
1891000	1893000	In this news article,
1893000	1895000	some people
1895000	1897000	describe Mei Lanfang
1897000	1899000	as a piece of meat
1899000	1901000	that everyone wants.
1901000	1903000	that everyone wants.
1903000	1905000	Basically,
1905000	1907000	Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.
1907000	1909000	to perform in the 1920s.
1909000	1911000	In this news article,
1911000	1913000	Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.
1913000	1915000	to perform in the 1920s.
1915000	1917000	When she came back to China,
1917000	1919000	she was very popular.
1919000	1921000	She was very popular.
1921000	1923000	She was very popular.
1923000	1925000	On the other hand,
1925000	1927000	her mother
1927000	1929000	died at the same time.
1929000	1931000	Mei Lanfang was very sad.
1933000	1935000	The worst part of this news article
1935000	1937000	is that
1937000	1939000	Mei Lanfang not only
1939000	1941000	felt sad for her mother's death,
1941000	1943000	but also wanted to
1943000	1945000	deal with the two beautiful wives.
1945000	1947000	deal with the two beautiful wives.
1947000	1949000	The two beautiful wives
1949000	1951000	are not Wang Minghua,
1951000	1953000	but Fu Zhifang and Meng Xiaodong.
1953000	1955000	Meng Xiaodong is the one
1955000	1957000	who is fighting for the two women.
1957000	1959000	Mei Lanfang is very sad.
1959000	1961000	Mei Lanfang is very sad.
1961000	1963000	The gossip media
1963000	1965000	likes to show these things.
1965000	1967000	The gossip media likes to show these things.
1967000	1969000	The way these articles are reported
1969000	1971000	is very meaningful.
1971000	1973000	is very meaningful.
1973000	1975000	It's not just about
1975000	1977000	It's not just about
1977000	1979000	discussing their family affairs.
1979000	1981000	discussing their family affairs.
1983000	1985000	Then,
1985000	1987000	Then,
1987000	1989000	in 1932,
1989000	1991000	in 1932,
1991000	1993000	Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong
1993000	1995000	officially divorced.
1995000	1997000	Meng Xiaodong said
1997000	1999000	Meng Xiaodong said
2009000	2011000	Meng Xiaodong said
2011000	2013000	Meng Xiaodong said
2013000	2015000	their relationship is always very good
2015000	2017000	Meng Xiaodong said
2017000	2019000	their relationship is always very good
2019000	2021000	Meng Xiaodong said
2021000	2023000	me and Wanhua
2023000	2025000	Meng Xiaodong said
2025000	2027000	we also have no need to bother many people with separating
2027000	2029000	we also have no need to bother many people with separating
2029000	2031000	he meant that it's good to be separated
2031000	2033000	he was very polite
2033000	2035000	he meant that it's good to be separated
2035000	2037000	it's also mentioned on a report
2037000	2039000	about their divorce
2039000	2041000	so
2043000	2045000	then
2045000	2047000	I will show you
2047000	2049000	what I circled
2049000	2051000	what I circled
2051000	2053000	Meng Xiaodong's key difference
2053000	2055000	before that
2055000	2057000	he said it's good to be separated
2057000	2059000	in 1933
2059000	2061000	so you can see
2061000	2063000	in 1932
2063000	2065000	he said it's good to be separated
2065000	2067000	in 1933 he got angry
2067000	2069000	because
2069000	2071000	the news wrote many awful things
2071000	2073000	and it's very serious
2073000	2075000	and it's very serious
2075000	2077000	some even said
2077000	2079000	Meng Xiaodong was cheating or something
2079000	2081000	in 1933
2081000	2083000	there was a warning
2083000	2085000	and at the same time
2085000	2087000	a lawyer said
2087000	2089000	Meng Xiaodong
2089000	2091000	Meng Xiaodong
2091000	2093000	hired me to be his lawyer
2093000	2095000	hired me to be his lawyer
2095000	2097000	so if anyone
2097000	2099000	dare to write nonsense
2099000	2101000	we will sue you
2101000	2103000	so Meng Xiaodong
2103000	2105000	Meng Xiaodong
2105000	2107000	started to use the newspaper
2107000	2109000	as a counterattack
2109000	2111000	to his independence
2111000	2113000	this is a warning
2113000	2115000	to his independence
2115000	2117000	so
2117000	2119000	let me read it
2119000	2121000	let me read it
2121000	2123000	the warrior, Meng Xiaodong,
2123000	2125000	was a child and very good at study
2125000	2127000	he was not very good at reading
2127000	2129000	he was not very good at studying
2129000	2131000	and he never learned
2131000	2133000	and he never learned
2133000	2135000	and he never learned
2135000	2137000	and he never learned
2137000	2139000	so
2139000	2141000	this is a warning
2141000	2143000	he can't stand it
2143000	2145000	Meng Xiaodong thought it was annoying
2145000	2147000	he wanted to stop telling gossips
2147000	2149000	he wanted to stop telling gossips
2149000	2151000	but the interesting thing is
2151000	2153000	when I was looking for newspapers
2153000	2155000	when I was looking for newspapers
2155000	2157000	I didn't find so many gossips
2157000	2159000	I didn't find so many gossips
2159000	2161000	I think one possibility is
2161000	2163000	that those newspapers are gone
2163000	2165000	they didn't stay until today
2165000	2167000	the second possibility is
2167000	2169000	maybe those gossips
2169000	2171000	are not published in the newspapers
2171000	2173000	they are more like a
2173000	2175000	gossip
2175000	2177000	gossip
2177000	2179000	gossip
2179000	2181000	gossip
2181000	2183000	gossip
2183000	2185000	gossip
2185000	2187000	gossip
2187000	2189000	gossip
2189000	2191000	gossip
2191000	2193000	gossip
2193000	2195000	gossip
2195000	2197000	gossip
2197000	2199000	gossip
2199000	2201000	gossip
2201000	2203000	gossip
2203000	2205000	gossip
2205000	2207000	gossip
2207000	2209000	gossip
2209000	2211000	gossip
2211000	2213000	gossip
2213000	2215000	gossip
2215000	2217000	clip
2217000	2219000	clip
2219000	2221000	clip
2251000	2253000	And then after he published
2253000	2255000	that warning
2255000	2257000	he
2257000	2259000	Later on, he began to worship
2259000	2261000	I'm sorry to worship Yu Shuyan as a teacher
2261000	2263000	Then here we will
2263000	2265000	It will be involved in how he
2265000	2267000	turn that is the actress
2267000	2269000	in the drama circle
2269000	2271000	status
2271000	2273000	So when I read the magazine
2273000	2275000	I will also see a very interesting phenomenon
2275000	2277000	is that they discuss the actor
2277000	2279000	They call her Mingling
2279000	2281000	The male actor is called the female spirit
2281000	2283000	But why is the male actor not the male spirit
2283000	2285000	Or the female actor is not Mingling
2285000	2287000	Just this way of classification
2287000	2289000	In fact, it has already shown the society at the time
2289000	2291000	He is the whole
2291000	2293000	is the sexual imagination
2293000	2295000	The male actor is the famous Mingling
2295000	2297000	The actress is a female actor
2297000	2299000	Then
2299000	2301000	He
2301000	2303000	Mo Xiaodong
2303000	2305000	One of the ways to turn this way
2305000	2307000	It's very
2307000	2309000	Very ironic
2309000	2311000	His way
2311000	2313000	His way of sarcasm is
2313000	2315000	How do you turn a girl
2315000	2317000	In the drama circle
2317000	2319000	First of all, you have to have a super famous
2319000	2321000	Male teacher
2321000	2323000	You can't go to a female teacher again
2323000	2325000	Because the actress has already been looked down upon
2325000	2327000	What's the use of going to a female teacher
2327000	2329000	You must find a famous male teacher
2329000	2331000	And this male teacher must be respected by everyone
2331000	2333000	And then on stage
2333000	2335000	How does he show himself
2335000	2337000	You can't play yourself
2337000	2339000	You can't play your own style
2339000	2341000	Because no one cares about your style
2341000	2343000	You have to play Yu Shuyuan
2343000	2345000	You have to play Yu
2345000	2347000	You are not
2347000	2349000	For example, you are playing Zhuge Liang on stage today
2349000	2351000	You are not playing Zhuge Liang
2351000	2353000	You are playing Zhuge Liang
2353000	2355000	Only through this way
2355000	2357000	To make others feel
2357000	2359000	You are a good actor
2359000	2361000	Because you are better than those other male actors
2361000	2363000	There is a way
2363000	2365000	Like Yu Shuyuan
2365000	2367000	So like Yu Shuyuan
2367000	2369000	Is a very important point
2369000	2371000	So in this whole
2371000	2373000	Within the scope of gender performance
2373000	2375000	Meng Xiaodong, he blurs
2375000	2377000	The boundary between the male spirit and the female spirit
2377000	2379000	He
2379000	2381000	He is no longer just a female spirit
2381000	2383000	He is also a male spirit
2383000	2385000	Because he is better than male actors
2385000	2387000	Can perform Yu's Zhuge Liang
2387000	2389000	Zhuge Liang
2391000	2393000	Then we said
2393000	2395000	Before
2395000	2397000	When he was 13
2397000	2399000	The report said
2399000	2401000	If he grows up to 16 or 17 years old
2401000	2403000	He will definitely be like these women
2403000	2405000	It's the same
2405000	2407000	But
2407000	2409000	This situation is
2409000	2411000	After he lost to Yu Shuyuan
2411000	2413000	There are very different changes
2413000	2415000	For example, there is a report that says
2415000	2417000	There is a special case
2417000	2419000	He is Meng Xiaodong
2419000	2421000	All female actors
2421000	2423000	Anyway, female actors are female actors
2423000	2425000	But there is a special case
2425000	2427000	He is Meng Xiaodong
2427000	2429000	Or they will
2429000	2431000	Keep talking about Meng Xiaodong's voice
2431000	2433000	Then say
2433000	2435000	Meng Xiaodong's voice is
2435000	2437000	Better than Tan Fuying
2437000	2439000	Better than Ma Lianliang
2439000	2441000	Better than Yan Jipeng
2441000	2443000	Better than Wang Youzhen
2443000	2445000	All these
2445000	2447000	Sorry, Wang Youchen
2447000	2449000	So all these names
2449000	2451000	All these names
2451000	2453000	Are very famous male students
2453000	2455000	So when they put Meng Xiaodong
2455000	2457000	This name and other famous male actors
2457000	2459000	When comparing
2459000	2461000	It means he can already succeed
2461000	2463000	Can't say it's a complete success
2463000	2465000	But at least he challenged
2465000	2467000	In the industry
2467000	2469000	Gender rights
2469000	2471000	Then another one
2471000	2473000	This report
2473000	2475000	Just show you the title
2475000	2477000	Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao
2477000	2479000	Worth a compliment
2479000	2481000	Compare with Xiaodong
2481000	2483000	We just talked about
2483000	2485000	Yu Shuyuan's life
2485000	2487000	Two disciples
2487000	2489000	One is Li Shaochun
2489000	2491000	The other is Meng Xiaodong
2491000	2493000	From this title alone
2493000	2495000	We can see
2495000	2497000	Obviously this commentator
2497000	2499000	He thinks Meng Xiaodong is better
2499000	2501000	Because if
2501000	2503000	He thinks Meng Xiaodong is worse
2503000	2505000	Why take Li Shaochun and Meng Xiaodong
2505000	2507000	To compare
2507000	2509000	He can say
2509000	2511000	Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao is worth a compliment
2511000	2513000	Much better than Meng Xiaodong
2513000	2515000	He doesn't need to compare with Meng Xiaodong
2515000	2517000	Of course it's because Meng Xiaodong's performance is better
2517000	2519000	So Li Shaochun is also very good
2519000	2521000	But not as good as Meng Xiaodong
2521000	2523000	So I have to compare with Meng Xiaodong
2523000	2525000	So again
2525000	2527000	We have seen
2527000	2529000	When he was in his 20s
2529000	2531000	When people talk about actors
2531000	2533000	Talking about female actors is talking about female actors
2533000	2535000	Talking about male actors is talking about male actors
2535000	2537000	The age and age of women are not related
2537000	2539000	But now he broke that boundary
2543000	2545000	Then
2545000	2547000	In 1943
2547000	2549000	When he studied with Yu Shuyuan for about six years
2549000	2551000	Unfortunately, Yu Shuyuan passed away
2551000	2553000	Then he wrote in the newspaper
2553000	2555000	A report
2555000	2557000	This is my English translation
2557000	2559000	This is my English translation
2559000	2561000	But the original text is
2561000	2563000	Unfortunately, I am a woman
2563000	2565000	Unfortunately, I am a woman
2565000	2567000	Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance
2567000	2569000	Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance
2569000	2571000	Then
2571000	2573000	The second
2573000	2575000	Then the fourth line
2575000	2577000	He wants to say
2577000	2579000	Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues
2579000	2581000	Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues
2581000	2583000	Senior and junior
2583000	2585000	They will continue to perform
2585000	2587000	They will continue to perform
2587000	2589000	Then they will
2589000	2591000	They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan
2591000	2593000	They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan
2593000	2595000	And me
2595000	2597000	I have no achievements
2597000	2599000	I have no achievements
2599000	2601000	We just talked about
2601000	2603000	We just talked about
2603000	2605000	He is blurred
2605000	2607000	The boundary between male and female actors
2607000	2609000	The boundary between male and female actors
2609000	2611000	But in this report
2611000	2613000	He blurs himself very much
2613000	2615000	I think this
2615000	2617000	I think this article is actually a very interesting thing
2617000	2619000	I think this article is actually a very interesting thing
2619000	2621000	Meng Xiaodong is a bit
2621000	2623000	He is a bit cynical
2623000	2625000	He is a bit cynical
2625000	2627000	So when he said
2627000	2629000	Unfortunately, I am a woman
2629000	2631000	I just can't do it very well
2631000	2633000	Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors
2633000	2635000	Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors
2635000	2637000	He really feels that way
2637000	2639000	He really feels that way
2639000	2641000	I'm not very sure
2641000	2643000	I'm not very sure
2643000	2645000	What is he thinking
2645000	2647000	But this way of writing
2647000	2649000	You can feel
2649000	2651000	He is a woman
2651000	2653000	He is a woman
2653000	2655000	But he wants to learn the fish
2655000	2657000	But he wants to learn the fish
2657000	2659000	He has some resentment
2659000	2661000	He has some resentment
2661000	2663000	Not so simple emotions
2663000	2665000	He has some very complicated things in it
2665000	2667000	These very complicated emotions
2667000	2669000	Including the one in the drama
2669000	2671000	Including the one in the drama
2671000	2673000	Gender and then
2673000	2675000	And all the time
2675000	2677000	Everyone thinks that female actors
2677000	2679000	Everyone thinks that female actors
2679000	2681000	Because I feel that what conditions are born
2681000	2683000	Because I feel that what conditions are born
2683000	2685000	Will make them unable to play well
2685000	2687000	Will make them unable to play well
2687000	2689000	Although Meng Xiaodong is very
2689000	2691000	Although Meng Xiaodong is very
2691000	2693000	He said he had no achievements
2693000	2695000	But in fact, in the later newspaper
2695000	2697000	A lot of people describe it
2697000	2699000	A lot of people describe it
2699000	2701000	Fish succulent
2701000	2703000	Or I would say
2703000	2705000	Fish succulent is dead
2705000	2707000	The only way we can hear
2707000	2709000	The only way we can hear
2709000	2711000	The only way we can hear
2711000	2713000	It's only Meng Xiaodong
2713000	2715000	It's only Meng Xiaodong
2715000	2717000	It's only Meng Xiaodong
2717000	2719000	Meng Xiaodong
2719000	2721000	Meng Xiaodong
2721000	2723000	Meng Xiaodong
2753000	2755000	I went out to envy
2755000	2757000	This happened in Shanghai
2757000	2759000	He said no
2759000	2761000	He said I was not angry
2761000	2763000	He said I was not angry
2763000	2765000	I don't want to break the tradition
2765000	2767000	My teacher never taught me
2767000	2769000	I have to come out to admire
2769000	2771000	I have to come out to admire
2771000	2773000	There is a very interesting point
2773000	2775000	There is a very interesting point
2775000	2777000	You must come out to admire
2777000	2779000	You must come out to admire
2779000	2781000	You must come out to admire
2781000	2783000	Who invented this
2783000	2785000	It's Meilanfang
2785000	2787000	It was started in Shanghai
2787000	2789000	It was started in Shanghai
2789000	2791000	When Meng Xiaodong said
2791000	2793000	When Meng Xiaodong said
2793000	2795000	It was a new trend
2795000	2797000	It was a new trend
2797000	2799000	But at the same time
2799000	2801000	It may be to a certain extent
2801000	2803000	Back then
2803000	2805000	Back then
2805000	2807000	Back then
2807000	2809000	Upset
2839000	2841000	I thought it was a matter of course
2841000	2843000	I thought it was a matter of course
2845000	2847000	And
2847000	2849000	The last point
2849000	2851000	Let's talk about
2851000	2853000	The style of the fish
2853000	2855000	The style of the fish
2855000	2857000	What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring
2857000	2859000	What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring
2859000	2861000	Let him get a lot
2861000	2863000	Let him get a lot
2863000	2865000	And a lot of viewers love him
2865000	2867000	And a lot of viewers love him
2897000	2899000	Both Meng Xiaodong and Meilanfang
2899000	2901000	Will perform at the birthday party
2901000	2903000	Will perform at the birthday party
2903000	2905000	So the gossip reporters started to move
2905000	2907000	So the gossip reporters started to move
2907000	2909000	I want to see them perform together
2909000	2911000	I want to see them perform together
2911000	2913000	So
2913000	2915000	So
2915000	2917000	The point here is
2917000	2919000	After he lost to Yu Shuyan
2919000	2921000	After he lost to Yu Shuyan
2921000	2923000	He became a very good performer
2923000	2925000	He became a very good performer
2925000	2927000	The performance was worth it
2927000	2929000	I even feel that after Yu Shuyan died
2929000	2931000	I can only rely on Meng Xiaodong
2931000	2933000	But you can't control these things
2933000	2935000	But you can't control these things
2935000	2937000	Don't talk about his gossip
2939000	2941000	These things
2941000	2943000	These things
2943000	2945000	Don't let everyone talk about his gossip
2945000	2947000	There are some more detailed stories
2947000	2949000	There are some more detailed stories
2949000	2951000	I won't say anymore
2951000	2953000	I won't say anymore
2953000	2957000	As we say, he's in his 20s
2957000	2959000	Some unconsciously
2959000	2961000	Some unconsciously
2961000	2963000	2017
2963000	2965000	Although he's not like before
2965000	2967000	Although he's not like before
2967000	2969000	However, these things
2969000	2971000	Are not able to completely avoid
2971000	2973000	Moreover, this will also hurt
2973000	2975000	It feels that
2975000	2977000	His realization is to learn from others
2977000	2979000	His realization is to learn from others
2979000	2981000	He's not able to create his own ranks
2981000	2983000	But I think this is a
2983000	2985000	In this era, sometimes there will be some
2985000	2987000	Unnecessary restrictions
2987000	2989000	You can't ask a person
2989000	2991000	To completely
2991000	2993000	To completely
2993000	2995000	To completely
2995000	2997000	To completely
2997000	2999000	To completely
2999000	3001000	To completely
3001000	3003000	To completely
3003000	3005000	To completely
3005000	3007000	To completely
3007000	3009000	To completely
3009000	3011000	To completely
3011000	3013000	Time is almost up
3013000	3015000	I quickly tell you
3015000	3017000	I hope that everyone remembers
3017000	3019000	I hope that everyone remembers
3019000	3021000	What we discussed
3021000	3023000	From 1920 to 1950
3023000	3025000	The public
3025000	3027000	The public and gossip
3027000	3029000	About what happened to Meng Xiaodong
3029000	3031000	We just said
3031000	3033000	From the beginning
3033000	3035000	He was considered as a woman
3035000	3037000	And was constantly misinterpreted
3037000	3039000	After he lost to Yu Shuyan
3039000	3041000	Everyone saw
3041000	3043000	His achievements in the art of fish
3043000	3045000	And see him in the art of fish
3045000	3047000	And we have to recognize one thing
3047000	3049000	It's because he lost to Yu Shuyan
3049000	3051000	It's because he learned fish well
3051000	3053000	So everyone recognizes his achievements
3053000	3055000	If he lost today
3055000	3057000	Any excellent female teacher
3057000	3059000	Maybe everyone won't think so
3059000	3061000	Then
3061000	3063000	So all the way we can see
3063000	3065000	Everyone gossip
3065000	3067000	From misinterpretation
3067000	3069000	To respect
3069000	3071000	To see him as a good artist
3071000	3073000	To see him as a good artist
3073000	3075000	But at the same time
3075000	3077000	But at the same time
3077000	3079000	It's not like
3079000	3081000	We will discuss the art of fish
3081000	3083000	We will discuss the art of fish
3083000	3085000	It's not like that
3085000	3087000	There are some restrictions
3087000	3089000	There are some restrictions
3089000	3091000	Then
3091000	3093000	How did Meng Xiaodong
3093000	3095000	Resist those
3095000	3097000	Misinterpreted reports
3097000	3099000	Misinterpreted reports
3099000	3101000	Mainly
3101000	3103000	Mainly I answer this question
3103000	3105000	I'm using
3105000	3107000	Meng Xiaodong's report on the police
3107000	3109000	Meng Xiaodong's report on the police
3109000	3111000	It's gossip news
3111000	3113000	He also uses newspapers to respond
3113000	3115000	These reports
3115000	3117000	That is to say the newspaper as a public space
3117000	3119000	That is to say the newspaper as a public space
3119000	3121000	Then you can use it
3121000	3123000	To attack you
3123000	3125000	The third point is
3125000	3127000	How did Meng Xiaodong
3127000	3129000	Find a way
3129000	3131000	To get him
3131000	3133000	To get him
3133000	3135000	To get him
3135000	3137000	To get him
3137000	3139000	In this way
3139000	3141000	I personally think
3141000	3143000	Because he worshiped Yu Shuyan
3143000	3145000	He worshipped Yu Shuyan and studied very hard
3145000	3147000	Let the public think
3147000	3149000	He is the male version of Yu Shuyan
3149000	3151000	He is the only one who can be considered
3151000	3153000	He is the only one who can be considered
3153000	3155000	He is the only one who can be considered
3155000	3157000	He uses a male teacher
3157000	3159000	He uses a male teacher
3159000	3161000	To be the shield
3161000	3163000	Of course he did well
3163000	3165000	To draw these gossips
3165000	3167000	The last point we said
3167000	3169000	He performed
3169000	3171000	Actually, it's all about performing his teacher
3171000	3173000	What are the restrictions on the teacher?
3173000	3175000	On the one hand, of course
3175000	3177000	Perform your teacher
3177000	3179000	Don't let those gossips
3179000	3181000	Completely away from you
3181000	3183000	As long as there is an opportunity
3183000	3185000	The gossip media will still be
3185000	3187000	The reporter will still be active
3187000	3189000	The second is that you perform your teacher
3189000	3191000	But what you perform is always his style
3191000	3193000	You can't create your own style
3195000	3197000	Yes, and finally
3197000	3199000	I want to show you
3199000	3201000	A trailer
3201000	3203000	Then ask Pei Xuan to prepare
3203000	3205000	Help me broadcast this trailer
3205000	3207000	This trailer is a movie
3207000	3209000	Mei Lanfang
3209000	3211000	2008 movie
3211000	3213000	Mei Lanfang is played by Li Ming
3213000	3215000	Meng Xiaodong is played by Zhang Ziyi
3215000	3217000	To be honest, it's not a particularly good movie
3217000	3219000	Because the family had a lot of
3219000	3221000	Because the family had a lot of
3221000	3223000	Rebellion and unhappiness
3223000	3225000	How can you write my ancestor like this
3225000	3227000	So some parts of this movie
3227000	3229000	It's pretty beautiful
3229000	3231000	Especially inside
3231000	3233000	There is a
3233000	3235000	Mei Lanfang's
3235000	3237000	Friend is Qi Rushan
3237000	3239000	He later came to Taiwan and became
3239000	3241000	Taiwan is very famous
3241000	3243000	Famous people in the cultural world
3243000	3245000	It's also very serious
3245000	3247000	Because I think it's with the Kuomintang
3247000	3249000	Anyway
3249000	3251000	Anyway, it's fun
3251000	3253000	If you are interested in knowing more
3253000	3255000	You can also watch this kind of movie
3255000	3257000	Then if you are interested
3257000	3259000	If you know more, you can
3259000	3261000	Google different things on the Internet
3261000	3263000	Please help me broadcast this documentary
3263000	3265000	Thank you all
3265000	3267000	It's not a documentary, it's a movie
3291000	3293000	Miss Meng
3293000	3295000	Mei Daye
3295000	3297000	See you on stage
3303000	3305000	Who destroyed her lonely dream

3309000	3311000	Know
3311000	3313000	What do you have
3313000	3315000	Just say it
3315000	3317000	Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong
3317000	3319000	It turned out to be this sentence
3319000	3321000	Meng Xiaodong will never meet Mei Lanfang again
3321000	3323000	Say it again
3323000	3325000	Meng Xiaodong
3325000	3327000	Let go
3333000	3335000	You dare to lie to me
3335000	3337000	Because you can't leave Mei Lanfang
3337000	3339000	Who is your sister
3343000	3345000	Tang Xiaohong
3345000	3347000	You dare
3347000	3349000	Thank you
3365000	3367000	Thank you
3367000	3369000	My speech ends here
3369000	3371000	Thank you all
3371000	3373000	Thank you Yunpu
3373000	3375000	Thank you for his wonderful speech
3375000	3377000	Now it's time for Q&A
3377000	3379000	Does anyone have any questions?
3379000	3381000	Does anyone have any questions?
3385000	3387000	If not
3387000	3389000	I'll ask the first question
3389000	3391000	I'll ask the first question
3391000	3393000	I want to ask
3393000	3395000	In that era, including the small newspaper
3395000	3397000	Who is the main target?
3397000	3399000	Who is the main target?
3399000	3401000	Who is the main target?
3401000	3403000	Who reads newspapers today?
3403000	3405000	Who reads newspapers today?
3405000	3407000	Because most people
3407000	3409000	Because most people
3409000	3411000	They read the newspaper
3411000	3413000	They read the newspaper
3413000	3415000	Can't completely say
3415000	3417000	Can't completely say
3417000	3419000	Not a real literate
3419000	3421000	Not a real literate
3421000	3423000	Not a real literate
3423000	3425000	He read the dictionary
3425000	3427000	He read the dictionary
3427000	3429000	He doesn't want to be a poet
3429000	3431000	What green-daisy history poems
3431000	3433000	What green-daisy history poems
3433000	3435000	What green-daisy history poems
3435000	3435000	
3435000	3437000	I remember, just
3437000	3439000	I used to read Poetry Dream
3439000	3441000	It was for example that their
3441000	3443000	It was for example that their
3443000	3445000	It was for example that their
3445000	3447000	poetry
3449000	3451000	this is the people more or less
3451000	3453000	I think
3453000	3455000	first of all, the Red Dragon dream was passed down
3455000	3457000	primero, la playa comprehensivamente
3457000	3459000	gradually collapsed, there is a relationship
3459000	3461000	so
3461000	3463000	I don't know what to say about them
3463000	3465000	I believe it is
3465000	3467000	There must be some people like the Red Dragon dream
3467000	3469000	Anyway, the family is
3469000	3471000	After the family comes to the middle
3471000	3473000	Then come to see those gossip
3473000	3475000	right
3475000	3477000	But to say
3477000	3479000	In the end
3479000	3481000	In the end
3481000	3483000	Who is the one who sees it completely?
3483000	3485000	I think
3485000	3487000	I think the people who see it
3487000	3489000	It's very wide
3489000	3491000	It's from
3491000	3493000	Very wide, but not to everyone
3493000	3495000	Because after all, many people are literate
3495000	3497000	But the problem is that you are really
3497000	3499000	The kind of high class is really
3499000	3501000	The kind of literate
3501000	3503000	More aristocratic
3503000	3505000	Then they are quite ignorant
3505000	3507000	I want to ask a question
3507000	3509000	That is to say
3509000	3511000	So Meng Xiaodong is in that era
3511000	3513000	Is the first person to worship Nanlaoshi as a teacher?
3513000	3515000	Is there anyone else doing this in the future?
3517000	3519000	I think I see it now
3519000	3521000	I see it now, I think he is
3521000	3523000	The first person to worship Nanlaoshi so formally
3523000	3525000	It wasn't before
3525000	3527000	But everyone might just learn a play
3527000	3529000	Or say a few words
3529000	3531000	So that probably doesn't count
3531000	3533000	Is the real worship
3533000	3535000	Then is there anyone after him?
3535000	3537000	Because there are still a lot of female teachers today
3537000	3539000	Can't say a lot, there are still female teachers in the drama world today
3539000	3541000	Yes
3541000	3543000	Thank you
3543000	3545000	May I ask
3545000	3547000	If you have any questions
3547000	3549000	You can ask now
3549000	3551000	Or if you want to post it in the chat room
3551000	3553000	I can also help you
3553000	3555000	Ok
3555000	3557000	There is a question in the chat room
3557000	3559000	Is it qualitative research?
3559000	3561000	Or can it be quantified?
3561000	3563000	I think I should be considered qualitative research
3563000	3565000	After all, it is file research
3565000	3567000	Then analyze
3567000	3569000	Some articles
3569000	3571000	Can it be quantified?
3571000	3573000	This is a good question
3573000	3575000	Because I did a digital paper before
3575000	3577000	Then I have put a part of
3577000	3579000	The file I collected
3579000	3581000	Is it quantified?
3581000	3583000	But I think
3583000	3585000	That quantification is still very shallow
3585000	3587000	It's more like
3587000	3589000	All about these gossips
3589000	3591000	For example, in different cities
3591000	3593000	Then there are a few
3593000	3595000	Then there are a few different newspapers
3595000	3597000	Some cities are also more popular
3597000	3599000	But this algorithm
3599000	3601000	There are still some problems
3601000	3603000	Because you say where the newspapers are the most
3603000	3605000	Of course, Beijing and Shanghai are the most
3605000	3607000	But can this explain
3607000	3609000	Can it be said that it is not popular in Wuxi?
3609000	3611000	Because it is also very popular in Wuxi
3611000	3613000	But the newspapers in Wuxi are not as many as those in Beijing and Shanghai
3613000	3615000	I think
3615000	3617000	It can be quantified
3617000	3619000	But there are many traps to be careful
3619000	3621000	In addition to gossip newspaper
3621000	3623000	Are there any other sources?
3623000	3625000	About this
3625000	3627000	I use gossip newspaper
3627000	3629000	But some of my other articles
3629000	3631000	For example
3631000	3633000	Female actors wrote their own memoirs
3633000	3635000	Something like this
3635000	3637000	Then some will
3637000	3639000	There is one thing I think I can
3639000	3641000	Just clarify
3641000	3643000	Why is most of it gossip newspaper?
3643000	3645000	Because the newspaper did not want to write them
3645000	3647000	Just these people
3647000	3649000	Just these people
3649000	3651000	They want to discuss more serious things
3651000	3653000	He didn't want to write these gossips
3653000	3655000	So this is why I found
3655000	3657000	Most of them are gossip newspaper
3657000	3659000	Or what kind of newspaper
3659000	3661000	Source
3661000	3663000	Then I have a question
3663000	3665000	It may be related to this
3665000	3667000	So at that time, the newspaper
3667000	3669000	Will not discuss at all
3669000	3671000	These
3671000	3673000	Artistic things
3673000	3675000	Or they will discuss other forms of art
3675000	3677000	But they feel that the newspaper is not enough
3677000	3679000	Or why?
3679000	3681000	For them
3681000	3683000	This is not art at all
3683000	3685000	For them, this is like today
3685000	3687000	For example
3687000	3689000	Will Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen say it is art?
3689000	3691000	It doesn't seem to be
3691000	3693000	It's just a popular entertainment
3693000	3695000	I seem to be a little disrespectful to Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen
3695000	3697000	Sorry
3697000	3699000	Anyway, in that era
3699000	3701000	The newspaper is a popular entertainment
3701000	3703000	You don't think it's art
3703000	3705000	Popular entertainment is like
3705000	3707000	Like today's stars
3707000	3709000	Who is in a relationship with who
3709000	3711000	Who got married and divorced
3711000	3713000	Just this feeling
3713000	3715000	So do you think Jay Chou will discuss these things?
3715000	3717000	Maybe a lot
3717000	3719000	Especially
3719000	3721000	I didn't talk about it in this speech
3721000	3723000	Probably
3723000	3725000	Around 1930
3725000	3727000	There was a shooting case
3727000	3729000	It's also related to Meng Xiaodong
3729000	3731000	Anyway
3731000	3733000	The gossip is widely spread
3733000	3735000	What do you say about Meng Xiaodong's admirer
3735000	3737000	Then I'm not happy that Meng Xiaodong is married to Mei Lanfang
3737000	3739000	And then I'm going to shoot Mei Lanfang
3739000	3741000	It's about shooting
3741000	3743000	Of course, the newspaper will report it
3743000	3745000	But
3745000	3747000	For gossip
3747000	3749000	But in general
3749000	3751000	They may publish a lot
3751000	3753000	It's a drama advertisement
3753000	3755000	You can see
3755000	3757000	What kind of play was played today
3757000	3759000	But they won't
3759000	3761000	Write some exaggerated gossip
3761000	3763000	So I mean
3763000	3765000	So these newspapers won't write about
3765000	3767000	Artistic comments on the drama
3767000	3769000	Or do they actually have any
3769000	3771000	Artistic comments are not included in the newspaper
3771000	3773000	According to the newspaper of that era
3773000	3775000	They will write artistic comments
3775000	3777000	But they almost only comment on male actors
3781000	3783000	And it's very serious
3783000	3785000	That kind of comment
3785000	3787000	For example
3787000	3789000	For example, he said
3789000	3791000	Someone played Si Lang Tan Mu
3791000	3793000	Then he based on that Si Lang Tan Mu
3793000	3795000	How to sing each sentence
3795000	3797000	And then make a super detailed comment
3797000	3799000	So even in Meng Xiaodong
3799000	3801000	It's like
3801000	3803000	It's considered
3803000	3805000	The first person in the old god
3805000	3807000	Even after the first person
3807000	3809000	These shocking newspapers
3809000	3811000	I still don't want to comment on his drama
3811000	3813000	I remember that
3813000	3815000	I have seen some
3815000	3817000	Not so many
3817000	3819000	More actually appeared in a newspaper
3819000	3821000	Called Beiyang Newspaper
3821000	3823000	That Beiyang Newspaper is basically
3823000	3825000	Meng Xiaodong's fans
3825000	3827000	I can't say that the whole Beiyang Newspaper is reporting Meng Xiaodong
3827000	3829000	But the editor-in-chief of Beiyang Newspaper
3829000	3831000	Sha Dafeng and several comments in it
3831000	3833000	They are all Meng Xiaodong's fans
3833000	3835000	So they reported a lot about him
3835000	3837000	Whether it's gossip
3837000	3839000	But because they are fans
3839000	3841000	So their gossip won't be that bad
3841000	3843000	They will
3843000	3845000	There will also be some positive news
3845000	3847000	About his performance
3847000	3849000	But first of all, the fans' eyes
3849000	3851000	Are all with rose filters
3851000	3853000	So they may also write more
3853000	3855000	You know
3855000	3857000	It will be more beautiful
3859000	3861000	Thank you
3861000	3863000	Does anyone else have other questions?
3863000	3865000	Or do you think
3865000	3867000	I don't speak clearly
3867000	3869000	Want me to clarify again
3869000	3871000	How to determine
3871000	3873000	Gossip newspaper
3873000	3875000	Is it exaggerated
3875000	3877000	How to determine
3877000	3879000	The topic you discussed today
3879000	3881000	The impact on the aftermath
3881000	3883000	Okay, first of all, I think
3883000	3885000	We can't be sure if the gossip newspaper is exaggerated
3885000	3887000	Because after all
3887000	3889000	We are not from that era
3889000	3891000	And even if we are from that era
3891000	3893000	Everyone will have a different opinion on one thing
3893000	3895000	I think the only thing I can do
3895000	3897000	Is to compare different gossip newspapers
3897000	3899000	To discuss
3899000	3901000	What they present
3901000	3903000	What is it
3903000	3905000	So I'm not going to comment
3905000	3907000	What the gossip newspaper writes is true or false
3907000	3909000	That's not important
3909000	3911000	What I want to discuss is how the gossip newspaper discusses Meng Xiaodong
3911000	3913000	And the topic I discussed today
3913000	3915000	The impact on the aftermath
3915000	3917000	Should refer to contribution
3917000	3919000	I think
3919000	3921000	What I care about the most
3921000	3923000	Is the right to speak in history
3923000	3925000	And the competition between genders
3925000	3927000	So what I'm going to discuss
3927000	3929000	So what I'm going to discuss today
3929000	3931000	To be honest
3931000	3933000	I don't care about Meng Xiaodong's story
3933000	3935000	Whether it's true or false
3935000	3937000	Whether those comments are true or false
3937000	3939000	The point is that I want to know
3939000	3941000	In that society
3941000	3943000	Through a story like Meng Xiaodong
3943000	3945000	Their contribution between genders
3945000	3947000	And the whole country
3947000	3949000	From the country to the Beijing Opera
3949000	3951000	To the family
3951000	3953000	How is their gender
3953000	3955000	Interaction between power and language
3955000	3957000	This is what I want to know the most
3957000	3959000	And then I want to know through this story
3959000	3961000	To understand that period of time
3961000	3963000	How the language of the whole society
3963000	3965000	How does the right to speak work
3965000	3967000	I hope this answers your question
3969000	3971000	Then I have another question
3971000	3973000	If the audience still has you
3973000	3975000	That is to say
3975000	3977000	In the process of speaking
3977000	3979000	That is to say
3979000	3981000	That's the second wife in the south
3981000	3983000	When she reported to her husband
3983000	3985000	That is to say
3985000	3987000	Then you mentioned
3987000	3989000	It seems that this power relationship
3989000	3991000	It's a bit convoluted
3991000	3993000	I think it seems
3993000	3995000	I'm not sure
3995000	3997000	My doubt is
3997000	3999000	Many times
3999000	4001000	You only call one person
4001000	4003000	It should be said that many times
4003000	4005000	Kindness seems to be a
4005000	4007000	Special attack on women
4007000	4009000	It doesn't sound like
4009000	4011000	A power relationship computer
4011000	4013000	But a
4013000	4015000	A special way to target women
4015000	4017000	Because
4017000	4019000	Continue
4019000	4021000	I just want to say
4021000	4023000	I want to say
4023000	4025000	I hardly hear anyone say
4025000	4027000	A man is kind
4027000	4029000	But you often hear people like to comment on women
4029000	4031000	So this is a
4031000	4033000	I'm repeating
4033000	4035000	It's a way to target women
4035000	4037000	Instead of a power relationship computer
4037000	4039000	I think you're really good at this
4039000	4041000	I think it's here again
4041000	4043000	Showed
4043000	4045000	I think it's about gender
4045000	4047000	The dynamic and power relationship
4047000	4049000	I think he seems to be
4049000	4051000	It's hard to say
4051000	4053000	It's fixed every time
4053000	4055000	That is to say
4055000	4057000	There may be a general trend
4057000	4059000	But if you look closely
4059000	4061000	It can be divided into a lot of things
4061000	4063000	And I totally agree
4063000	4065000	The kindness of women
4065000	4067000	Kindness is a plan
4067000	4069000	But at the same time
4069000	4071000	They can target this matter
4071000	4073000	Is to make a big article
4073000	4075000	For example, they never talk about Wang Minghua
4075000	4077000	Kindness, they only talk about Fu Zhifang
4077000	4079000	I think this matter actually reflects
4079000	4081000	Fu Zhifang at home
4081000	4083000	He does have power
4083000	4085000	Because you go to see other
4085000	4087000	Other is the actor
4087000	4089000	The relationship between them is that private life
4089000	4091000	You hardly see anything like Fu Zhifang
4091000	4093000	Almost all
4093000	4095000	What do you want to do
4095000	4097000	If you want to have an affair with someone, have an affair
4097000	4099000	Then their wife is in the position of the victim
4109000	4111000	I will add another example
4111000	4113000	He is not in the Republic of China
4113000	4115000	He is in
4115000	4117000	Dorothy Cole
4117000	4119000	I suddenly forgot
4119000	4121000	Anyway, it was during the Ming and Qing dynasties
4121000	4123000	Everyone usually thinks
4125000	4127000	The status of women
4127000	4129000	It feels like it's all over
4129000	4131000	Suppressed by men
4131000	4133000	But there are also scholars
4133000	4135000	They will do some research
4135000	4137000	If you look closely
4137000	4139000	The relationship in the family
4139000	4141000	You will find that the male owners
4141000	4143000	Men are fighting outside
4143000	4145000	As an official
4145000	4147000	Then stay away from home
4147000	4149000	But actually at home
4149000	4151000	Daughter and son
4151000	4153000	Support the whole family
4153000	4155000	So their status
4155000	4157000	May not be as low as everyone imagines
4157000	4159000	He used this method to discuss
4159000	4161000	Sexual power sometimes
4161000	4163000	Not so absolute
4163000	4165000	It's like a man
4167000	4169000	Thank you
4169000	4171000	Is there any audience
4171000	4173000	Any questions
4173000	4175000	If not
4175000	4177000	I will turn off the recording first
