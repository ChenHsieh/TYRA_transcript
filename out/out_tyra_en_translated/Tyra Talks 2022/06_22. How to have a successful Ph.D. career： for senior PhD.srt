00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome everyone to the Terra Talk on August 6th.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Dr. Chen Tai-Yan currently teaches at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
She graduated from the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University and the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Her Ph.D. was in Texas A&M.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
She did her Ph.D. in agricultural engineering.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
After her Ph.D., she moved to Cornell.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Her field of research is mostly...

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did I say it right?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I saw Dr. Tai-Yan laughing.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Her field of research is mostly single-molecule super-resolution microscopy.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Her research system is mostly biophysics.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Dr. Tai-Yan is a very good teacher.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She has given lectures in different fields and topics at Terra.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today, she will be talking about...

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
As a senior Ph.D. student,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
when your Ph.D. is in its second or third year,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you have gone through a lot.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you think about your next phase,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you have to prepare yourself.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You have to ask yourself some good questions.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This will allow you to move on to the next phase more smoothly.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's welcome Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you, Dr. Tai-Yan.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am very happy to be able to participate in Project Terra's talk today.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First of all, thanks for the kind invitation.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This talk is more informal.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you have any questions,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you can ask them in the middle of my talk.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I hope you can learn a lot from today's talk.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is a topic we talked about in the beginning of Project Terra.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How to have a successful Ph.D. career for senior Ph.D. students.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was surprised when I first saw this title.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It uses a very special word,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
which is successful Ph.D. career.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It is very difficult to define a successful Ph.D. career.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I personally feel that every student has a different background.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone has a different Ph.D. career,

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
so there is no specific formula for everyone.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What I am doing today is to share my personal experience

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and tell you what you can do to have a positive impact on your future development.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everyone has a different background,

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
so you can try it if it suits you.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I hope these tips can help you to have a better Ph.D. career.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me briefly introduce my personal experience.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My experience is not ordinary.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am a slow learner in every process.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think it is related to my personality.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I am a gentle person.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can see that I started my Ph.D. degree in 2018.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I graduated from my senior year in 2004.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I worked as a research assistant for a year and went abroad in 2005.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Before that, I was a chemistry major,

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
specifically a material scientist.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My main job was to synthesize some materials

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and make some luminous materials.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I was focused on synthesis.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When I finished my Ph.D. degree,

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
my boss asked me if I wanted to study for a Ph.D. degree.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I looked back at my classmates in the Ph.D. class.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I found that everyone was doing the same thing.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I found that everyone was doing the same thing.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My boss told me to study for a Ph.D. degree,

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
or else I would have to work in the industry.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At that time, I didn't have any prior knowledge.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was a country boy from Hualien.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
After studying at Tsingtao University for a few years,

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I never thought about going abroad.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It wasn't until my boss mentioned this to me

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that I seriously thought about going abroad.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was lucky enough to apply for A&M.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Since then, I have been living in the U.S. for 17 years.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I decided to change my field.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought synthesis was fun,

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but I felt like I was in a bottleneck.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I thought I understood how to do synthesis,

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but I didn't know if I did a good job.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't know how to determine the efficiency of synthesis.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I started to feel like we didn't discuss it in detail.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When doing synthesis,

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
we just guessed how to make it more efficient.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We didn't have a more fundamental understanding.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I decided to change my field.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I wanted to know more about the physics of these materials.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
At that time, Neoparticle was very popular.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I joined a lab that specializes in Neoparticle

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and does a lot of electronic, light, magnetic analysis.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I spent five and a half years doing this.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
During that time,

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I learned how to add a device,

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
how to analyze,

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and how to understand the advantages and disadvantages of a material

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
from a very fundamental perspective.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
After that,

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I started to think that

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I already had an intention that I wanted to be a teacher.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When I started to study for my Ph.D. degree,

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
my first goal was that I wanted to go back to Taiwan to be a professor.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But then I met a lot of different people.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So in the end, I ended up being a teacher in the U.S.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Later, you can see that

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
from Maths to Ph.D.,

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it's a bit like turning a corner.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You start to do very materialized things.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I think the biggest turning point in my life

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
was when I was studying for my postdoc.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Before that,

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I didn't have any background in biology.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But when I was studying for my postdoc,

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I did a 90-degree turn.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I spent five and a half years doing postdocs.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
At that time,

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I started to learn about monochromatic biology.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The main reason was that

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I met my wife.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My wife is a neon biologist.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I thought,

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
okay,

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
we can do some research together in the future.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's learn something new.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I didn't expect that

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
learning something new would take me five and a half years.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I spent five and a half years in Cornell.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I was hired to Cornell

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
mainly because I knew how to drive a car.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So when I got there,

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
my main job was to build up a super-low-energy microscope,

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and create software to analyze images.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That was my main job,

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
building instruments and analyzing things.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That was my main job.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But when I joined a new element,

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
my career took a big turn.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Later on,

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you can see that my current research program

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
started to connect with neural cells.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This process is very interesting.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If you have good support,

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
this is a very enjoyable process.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But it's not a typical process.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't recommend everyone to try this mode.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This mode has its advantages,

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but I think the difficulties in the middle are quite high.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you are interested,

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we can talk about this later.

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The main reason why I mentioned this is because

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you can see that

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I made a lot of changes in the direction of the pressure.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
In the process of these changes,

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think there is one thing I often do.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I like to chat with my friends,

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or I like to chat with my junior in the lab.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
In the process of chatting,

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the most frequently asked question is,

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
okay,

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the most frequently asked question is,

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
okay,

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When you study for a PhD,

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
what is the biggest challenge you face?

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I've been asking this question for 17 years.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I think,

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
in these processes,

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you can know what everyone thinks about PhDs.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
After hearing a lot of people's opinions,

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I started to have some questions about

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
what PhDs are all about.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Last week,

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
last week or the week before last,

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
last week,

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Project Tara invited Bo-Jun to share with you

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what he thinks about PhDs.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He also provided a lot of very useful advice.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Here are some of the things he provided.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For example,

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What do you want to do?

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How to find advice?

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Some general advice.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think they're all very, very good.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What I'm going to do today,

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I still want to address

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
why I want to study for a PhD.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In my personal opinion,

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this is the most important of all.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you clearly know

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
why you want to study for a PhD,

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think when you encounter a lot of difficulties,

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it will be much better to adjust your mindset.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When people ask you,

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I think the question you need to reflect on is,

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
what is the meaning of a PhD to me?

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I used to hear a lot of answers.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you have a PhD,

203
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
don't say you can independently solve problems.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can actually create,

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
find new knowledge by yourself.

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think these are all very good answers.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But,

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
it's my own feeling.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's my own feeling.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think a PhD is actually a lifestyle.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So far,

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
my personal understanding is that

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we were born until you grew up.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We've been trying to understand

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
how the world works.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It depends on your professional training.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
People, things, and objects

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
will make you

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
a little bit twisted

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
about how the world works.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Everyone knows that

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
these may be the same.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But those little things

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
will basically become the tipping point

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
for you to make a decision.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I think

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
if you study for a PhD,

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the biggest advantage is

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
that it is an excellent training platform.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So when you encounter a problem,

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you know how to analyze the problem,

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
how to define the problem,

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and how to solve the problem.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Then you can explain to others

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that I encountered this problem,

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and what I think it should be like.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When it's like this,

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I think it should have some impact.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
These things are actually

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
when you do experiments,

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
when you do research,

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think there is a very, very big overlap.

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
To a certain extent,

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think if you can imagine

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
a PhD as

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
your last training stage,

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
then I think

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if you can learn

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
its essence,

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think it will be a very helpful process

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
for your life.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Like I just said,

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
okay,

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
let's make a comparison.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
When you encounter a problem,

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
okay,

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the first thing is

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you have to understand

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
what the problem is.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Right?

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then this is the same as

273
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
when you do academic research,

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
okay,

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you do a lot of literature research,

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it's actually the same.

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
At first,

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
when you come up with a phenomenon,

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you don't know what happened.

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay.

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What you can do is

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
okay,

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to look for more documents

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to give me a better understanding

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
of this system.

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Okay.

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
In this case,

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you can start to define your problem.

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In other words,

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you can start to formulate your hypothesis.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay.

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
After that,

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
once you have a hypothesis,

295
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you can do the experiment.

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then after the experiment,

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you might say,

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
okay,

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
in the end,

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
okay,

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you might fail many times in the middle,

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
but in the end,

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
most likely,

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you can actually figure out something new.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Right?

306
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Now,

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
after this is over,

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
one very important thing,

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
one very important training

310
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
in Ph.D. is

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
okay,

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you need to actually

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
present your results.

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay.

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tell people why this is actually important.

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay.

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Then this thing

318
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
will be in your training,

319
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
in your presentation training,

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to get a

321
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
proper

322
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
preparation.

323
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

324
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So, in my opinion,

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think the biggest advantage of Ph.D. is that

326
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you learn a more systematic

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
method

328
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to deal with

329
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the problems in your life.

330
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is a relatively broad statement.

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But I think

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you project

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
what you learn in Ph.D.

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
into your life experience.

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I think this is the most

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
meaningful thing.

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So, this is

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
how I view the Ph.D.

341
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So, I think

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
what everyone does may not be the same.

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay.

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But the underlying principle

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and how you deal with things in your life

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think this really provides a

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
very, very good training place.

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

349
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So,

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
how do you define

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
whether your Ph.D. is successful or not?

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I think

353
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the easiest parameter is

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
whether you enjoy the process.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you can enjoy

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the process,

357
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and you can

358
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
make the things on the slide

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to an extreme,

360
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think it's a very successful

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ph.D. career.

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because the things you need

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
can follow you for a lifetime.

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think this is more important

365
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
than anything else.

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course,

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
some people do better,

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
some people do worse.

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But so what?

371
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay.

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Paper is paper, right?

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You can create new knowledge,

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but it's not going to go with you forever.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Right?

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You have to face new problems every day.

377
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Knowing how to handle these problems

378
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is more important,

379
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Okay.

381
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay, get back to this.

382
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think

383
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the timeline is important.

384
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
When you're doing your Ph.D.,

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
there's a timeline

386
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
in your mind.

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I think this is

388
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
a very, very important thing.

389
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay.

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I've highlighted some

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
more important

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
milestones

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
for your Ph.D.

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
In the first year,

395
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
when you first came in,

396
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
get used to the environment,

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
finish the course as soon as possible.

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
In the second year,

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you'll start to have

400
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the so-called

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Qualified Exam.

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
After the Qualified Exam,

404
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you'll become

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the so-called Ph.D. candidate.

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're no longer

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
just a student.

408
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

409
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're not a graduate student.

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're a Ph.D. candidate.

411
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then you start to propose

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
what you want to do.

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Then

415
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
work very hard,

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
publish some papers.

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
In the end,

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
this is

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
okay,

420
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
pass your dissertation.

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Then eventually,

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
do your defense.

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then eventually,

424
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
get your Ph.D.

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay.

426
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So it's a very, very

427
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
general process.

428
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This process

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
usually takes you

430
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
four to five years,

431
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
depending on

432
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
your research field.

433
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

434
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But I think

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
five years

436
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
has become

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
a more and more

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
common timeline.

439
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes.

440
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Of course,

441
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I guess engineers

442
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
may be faster.

443
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I think

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
five years at the Institute of Technology

445
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
seems to be more and more common.

446
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The good thing is

447
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think I've seen

448
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
more and more colleges

449
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
recently

450
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
put

451
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
some teachers

452
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
will let students

453
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
stay for six or seven years.

454
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This kind of thing

455
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
they do have

456
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
put in effort

457
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to minimize

458
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
these things

459
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
happen.

460
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

461
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So

462
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I guess

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in general,

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it should be

465
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
about five years

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
will be a reasonable timeline.

467
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
In these five years,

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think

470
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
it can be divided

471
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
into two stages.

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay.

473
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The first stage

474
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I call

475
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
training phase.

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay.

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The second one

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
is actually

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
networking phase.

480
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay.

481
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Training phase

482
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
is usually

483
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
if everything is ideal,

484
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think

485
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the better time

486
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
is in the first three years

487
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to put

488
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the training

489
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay.

490
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The skill set

491
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
should have

492
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
should have

493
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
knowledge

494
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
in the first three years

495
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
should be

496
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
almost the same.

497
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The fourth and fifth years

499
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
should be

500
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
focused on

501
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
networking

502
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
things.

503
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay.

504
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Networking

505
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I said networking

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
is like

507
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
going to a conference

508
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
or

509
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
dealing with people

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
you don't know.

511
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay.

512
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Start reaching out

513
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
to the company.

514
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay.

515
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The so-called

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
networking phase.

517
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay.

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A lot of people

519
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
squeeze this

520
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
networking phase

521
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to the last

522
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
semester.

523
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
My personal feeling

524
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that it's too late.

525
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay.

526
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So I think

527
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
having this

528
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
timeline

529
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
is important

530
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
in my heart.

531
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

532
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's talk

533
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
about

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
more

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
more

536
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
simple

537
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
more fundamental

538
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
things

539
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
how to

541
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
do things

542
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
on the food.

543
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
you can try

545
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to make

546
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the training phase

547
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
more smooth.

548
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.

549
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
In the training phase

550
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think

551
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
there are

552
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
three main points.

553
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The first point

554
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
is

555
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in the training

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
skill set

557
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is always

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
an important thing.

559
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

560
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Not everyone

561
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
wants to

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
be an

563
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
engineer.

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay.

565
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
In the industry

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
when you

567
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
are looking for

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
a job

569
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
what skills

570
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
will you list

571
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
on your CV?

572
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The company

573
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
will look at

574
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
your skills

575
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to decide

576
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
if you are

577
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the person

578
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
they need.

579
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Okay.

580
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So

581
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
scientific skills

582
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think

583
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
when you

584
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
think

585
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
okay

586
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you feel like

587
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
okay

588
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
maybe I'm not

589
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that into

590
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
academia

591
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
then I think

592
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
skills

593
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
will become

594
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
a very

595
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
important

596
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
element

597
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
when you

598
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
are looking

599
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
for an

600
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
industry job.

601
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

602
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The second

603
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is literature.

604
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think

605
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
literature

606
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
is relatively

607
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
important

608
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
in academia

609
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
because

610
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
if you

611
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
want to

612
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
go into

613
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
academia

614
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
you need to

615
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
propose

616
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
a lot

617
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
of experiments.

618
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When you

619
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
propose

620
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
a lot of

621
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
experiments

622
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
it will

623
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
not

624
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
be a

625
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
random

626
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
experiment.

627
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So

628
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you need to

629
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
know if

630
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it has

631
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
a big

632
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
impact

633
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
so you

634
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
need to

635
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
go

636
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
deep

637
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
into

638
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
the

639
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
professional

640
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
subjects.

641
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So

642
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
literature

643
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is a

644
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
very

645
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
important

646
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
element

647
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
especially

648
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
when you

649
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
are

650
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
looking

651
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
for an

652
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
industry job.

653
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

654
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Alright.

655
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's talk

656
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
about the

657
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
scientific

658
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
skills.

659
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

660
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think

661
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
when you

662
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
join a

663
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
lab

664
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
no,

665
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
before you

666
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
join a

667
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
lab

668
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you need to

669
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
know

670
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
what

671
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
skills

672
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you can

673
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
learn

674
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
from

675
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
joining

676
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
this

677
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
lab.

678
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Okay.

679
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sometimes

680
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
when students

681
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
are looking

682
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
for a

683
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
lab

684
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
they don't

685
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
know

686
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
what they

687
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
want.

688
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

689
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
To be honest

690
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think

691
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
more than

692
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
80% of

693
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
students

694
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
don't

695
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
know

696
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
what

697
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
they

698
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
want

699
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because

700
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
they

701
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
haven't

702
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
really

703
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
thought

704
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
about

705
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
it.

706
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Okay.

707
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So,

708
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000

you

712
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
need to

713
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
know

714
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you

717
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000

5th year.

1267
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Of course,

1268
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
if you

1269
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000

1276
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the industry

1277
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000

3rd year.

1280
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay.

1281
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm not

1282
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
interested in

1283
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
academia.

1284
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Okay.

1285
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I want to

1286
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000

No problem at

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
all.

1291
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But at

1292
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
this time,

1293
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you have to

1294
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
think carefully

1295
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
about

1296
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
interested in.

1300
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
At that time,

1301
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
it's a good

1302
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
opportunity to

1303
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
reach out.

1304
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay.

Introduce them

1306
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000

1307
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000

Okay.

1311
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Chat with

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay.

Okay.

1317
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Let them

1318
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
have an

1319
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000

1320
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000

Okay.

At the

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
same time,

1324
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
let them

1325
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
know

1326
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
how long

1327
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000

1334
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
if he or she

1335
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
really likes

1336
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you,

1337
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000

Okay.

1342
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Things

1343
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
will be

1344
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
a lot

1345
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
easier.

1346
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay.

1347
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Now,

1348
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
if you

1349
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
want to

1350
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000

okay,

1353
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you have

1354
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
to

1355
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
do

1356
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
your

1357
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
presentation.

1358
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If

1359
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
everything

1360
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
goes

1361
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
smoothly,

1362
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
getting

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000

postdoc position

1365
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
is not

1366
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that difficult

1367
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
either.

1368
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Okay.

1369
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Next,

1370
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
when you

1371
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
have identified

1372
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
the position

1373
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and the

1374
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
target,

1375
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
they will

1376
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
usually

1377
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
request

1378
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you to

1379
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
send

1380
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a letter

1381
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
to

1382
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
your

1383
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
letter writer

1384
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and

1385
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
company

1386
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
or

1387
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
your

1388
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
future

1389
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
postdoc

1390
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
boss.

1391
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay.

1392
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I

1393
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
think

1394
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
a lot of

1395
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
students

1396
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
have

1397
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
overlooked

1398
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
this

1399
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
important

1400
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
thing.

1401
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay.

1402
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Believe

1403
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
or not,

1404
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I

1405
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
think

1406
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
when

1407
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you

1408
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
graduate,

1409
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
you

1410
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
have to

1411
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
start

1412
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
looking

1413
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000

1622
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
letter

1623
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you

1624
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
need to

1625
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
learn.

1626
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Okay.

1627
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Like

1628
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
this.

1629
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
All

1630
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
right.

1631
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And

1632
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the

1633
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
last

1634
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
will be

1635
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
a

1636
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
review

1637
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
little

1638
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
recommendation.

1639
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay.

1640
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay.

1641
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Now

1642
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
come back to

1643
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
this.

1644
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Okay.

1645
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Again, five

1646
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
years, right?

1647
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Two phases.

1648
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Okay.

1649
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
How do

1650
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
you accomplish

1651
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
these tasks

1652
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
within five

1653
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
years?

1654
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay.

1655
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay.

1656
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay.

1657
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Well,

1658
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I can't really share my thoughts on this.

1659
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Because everyone really has different needs.

1660
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So, I think that the way I usually go about it is

1661
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
to think long term first.

1662
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm the type of person who starts to think long term and then slowly goes back to short term.

1663
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But some people like to start short term and then slowly go back to long term.

1664
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Either way is fine.

1665
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But I think that if I were to do this,

1666
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I would start with what my goal is for this semester.

1667
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Okay.

1668
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's say that's my goal.

1669
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
How far should I go in terms of time allocation

1670
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
in the first month and how far should I go in the second month?

1671
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Okay.

1672
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
If I have a goal for this month,

1673
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
what should I do every week?

1674
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Right?

1675
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then you can slowly go back to how far you want to go every day.

1676
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.

1677
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
PhD is a marathon.

1678
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Okay.

1679
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's a five-year process.

1680
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So, in the middle of this process,

1681
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I think planned vacation is also very important.

1682
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Okay.

1683
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
When I was studying for my PhD,

1684
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
every summer vacation,

1685
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm a person who really likes to go to National Park.

1686
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So, every summer vacation,

1687
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I would force myself to go to a National Park.

1688
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Okay.

1689
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So, I've been to a lot of different National Parks.

1690
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Okay.

1691
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I think that's a process that allows you to recharge yourself.

1692
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So, after these five years,

1693
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
you won't feel like you're totally burned out.

1694
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Okay.

1695
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I think the most important thing is to let yourself enjoy this process.

1696
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
All right?

1697
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay.

1698
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Finally,

1699
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I want to use this slide to summarize today's presentation.

1700
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Okay.

1701
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Okay.

1702
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I think mentality is a very, very important thing.

1703
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay.

1704
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Okay.

1705
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Okay.

1706
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Okay.

1707
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Okay.

1708
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Okay.

1709
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay.

1710
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Okay.

1711
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay.

1712
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Okay.

1713
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Okay.

1714
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Okay.

1715
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Okay.

1716
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Okay.

1717
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay.

1718
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay.

1719
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Okay.

1720
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay.

1721
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But the most important thing is that, okay,

1722
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
you can only improve when you do your presentation.

1723
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Okay.

1724
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If you don't improve, you will only feel good about yourself.

1725
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay.

1726
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You have to really do these things.

1727
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Okay.

1728
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It won't be too beautiful at first.

1729
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay.

1730
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But that is okay because that is not your,

1731
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
that is not your last presentation.

1732
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Okay.

1733
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
In this process, no matter what you do,

1734
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
you are just preparing for the last one.

1735
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay.

1736
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So you'd rather practice as many times as you can in this process.

1737
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Okay.

1738
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The more times you practice, the better.

1739
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Once you know how to fold,

1740
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
you won't fold like this in the future.

1741
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Okay.

1742
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So I think it's good for you to experience a lot of setbacks.

1743
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Of course, it's hard on your mind.

1744
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Okay.

1745
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But when you fold a lot of times,

1746
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
your mind becomes relatively strong.

1747
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Okay.

1748
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Then your endurance becomes very, very high.

1749
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Okay.

1750
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So I would strongly recommend that everyone is able to,

1751
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
don't be shy.

1752
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Okay.

1753
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You can do a presentation,

1754
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
go out and do a presentation.

1755
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Even if you know you are not ready,

1756
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
but still do it.

1757
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Okay.

1758
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Then, um,

1759
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
last, last, last.

1760
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I think this is actually not what I wrote.

1761
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
There are goals, there are opportunities, there are plans.

1762
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This is not what I'm talking about.

1763
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Okay.

1764
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
This is what Zhang Zhongmeng said.

1765
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Once I listened to his speech,

1766
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think these things are very suitable for PhD students.

1767
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Okay.

1768
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Like I said, five years is not a long time,

1769
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
not a short time, right?

1770
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But in order to be efficient to accomplish your goal,

1771
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
having a goal is very, very important.

1772
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because only if you have a goal,

1773
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
then you can have a plan.

1774
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay.

1775
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Without a goal, there is no plan.

1776
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay.

1777
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So the goal and the plan are actually put together.

1778
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Okay.

1779
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The goal is your focus.

1780
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The plan is just a means to pursue the goal.

1781
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Okay.

1782
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Then there is a discipline.

1783
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Discipline is something that everyone should know.

1784
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Because in this process,

1785
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it's not an easy process.

1786
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Okay.

1787
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
In order to really achieve to a certain level,

1788
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
discipline is very, very, very important.

1789
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Right.

1790
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I believe that if you talk to a lot of junior faculty,

1791
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you will find that their life is actually very, very boring.

1792
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Okay.

1793
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's usually a point-to-point life.

1794
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And what they do every day is basically the same.

1795
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Okay.

1796
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But it's because of these tedious processes.

1797
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Okay.

1798
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Causing this routine.

1799
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Okay.

1800
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Let them become a very disciplined person.

1801
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Okay.

1802
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That's because of these disciplines.

1803
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So that he can make a breakthrough in many aspects.

1804
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
All right.

1805
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Okay.

1806
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So in the end, I hope to be able to use this.

1807
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Have a goal, have a discipline, have a plan.

1808
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Three yes.

1809
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
To end today's speech.

1810
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If you have any questions,

1811
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I am more than happy to answer the question.

1812
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Thank you.

1813
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Thank you for Tai-Yan's sharing.

1814
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
When I was listening just now,

1815
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I felt very agreeable.

1816
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's like nodding your head.

1817
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Okay.

1818
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I want to reiterate some points.

1819
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because I just got on the job.

1820
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I am also a junior faculty.

1821
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Tai-Yan just talked about these.

1822
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
About presentation.

1823
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Of course,

1824
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Everyone is young.

1825
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
When you are a Ph.D. student,

1826
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You have learned a lot of skills.

1827
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
But we are more.

1828
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
There is no point to pay attention to.

1829
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I think it is.

1830
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Eventually it will become a very important point.

1831
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Presentation and networking.

1832
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Tai-Yan just said.

1833
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
There are some very practical practices.

1834
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Don't go to a conference without presentation.

1835
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I think this is very important.

1836
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
How to interact with others in the conference.

1837
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It is a very important point.

1838
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Also,

1839
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Tai-Yan just mentioned.

1840
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The letter from your advisor carries a lot of weight.

1841
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I can't agree more.

1842
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Your advisor can push you up.

1843
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Can also push you down.

1844
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So this is a very important thing.

1845
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Do you have any questions here?

1846
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
This is a fairly open space.

1847
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Everyone can ask any questions.

1848
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
As long as you turn on the microphone.

1849
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
By the way,

1850
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Patrick Winston's talk.

1851
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It was a reference when I was preparing my job talk.

1852
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
How to speak.

1853
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
YouTube video.

1854
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It is my reference.

1855
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I think he said very well.

1856
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Tai-Yan just said.

1857
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
When you talk about presentation.

1858
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You have to talk to people outside your field.

1859
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
My wife has heard my job talk hundreds of times.

1860
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So this is a very good way.

1861
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I can't agree more.

1862
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Do you have any questions?

1863
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You can just turn on the microphone and ask.

1864
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Can you hear me?

1865
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yes, I can hear you.

1866
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Can you introduce yourself first?

1867
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I want to say that everyone is so shy.

1868
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Let me ask first.

1869
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I am Lin Zhanhong.

1870
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I am currently at the Leibniz Research Center in Germany.

1871
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
PhD student.

1872
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It is currently the last year.

1873
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
In the writing stage.

1874
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Thank you for your speech.

1875
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
For the presentation and writing.

1876
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Whether it is thesis or paper part.

1877
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I think maybe.

1878
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
This is what I can refer to at the moment.

1879
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Because I am currently writing my thesis.

1880
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
In fact, I am more interested in asking the teacher.

1881
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I want to ask the teacher.

1882
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
The first question is about cross-field.

1883
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because I think the teacher seems to be from before.

1884
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
By the way, I used to be a chemistry major.

1885
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So I should call it a senior.

1886
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Then I want to ask the teacher.

1887
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Because I see that your field seems to have changed a lot.

1888
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
About this cross-field part.

1889
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The teacher just mentioned that maybe.

1890
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Enter a new field.

1891
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The fastest way is to put it first.

1892
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Find out the important fields in the first five years.

1893
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Then read it.

1894
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Then sort out your own summary.

1895
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But what I want to ask is that.

1896
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
What is the teacher's opinion on this cross-field?

1897
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
The teacher, do you think that in the original field.

1898
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean the cross-field is to say.

1899
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Is it a completely unrelated field?

1900
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Or is it a little bit combined?

1901
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But maybe.

1902
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
There are some overlaps.

1903
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There are some overlaps.

1904
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But it may not be completely related.

1905
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Then I don't know the teacher.

1906
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I mainly want to ask the teacher.

1907
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What do you think about the cross-field?

1908
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It's about the advantages and disadvantages of future development.

1909
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Because the other one is to see.

1910
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The teacher's post-doc has also been doing it for a long time.

1911
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
According to the academic world in Taiwan, as far as I know.

1912
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It seems to be too long.

1913
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So I just want to ask the teacher.

1914
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
What do you think about these things?

1915
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think about the cross-field.

1916
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think I can be a representative of the cross-field.

1917
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Because the field is really quite wide.

1918
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
From material chemistry.

1919
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Material physics.

1920
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Then it becomes biological physics.

1921
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
To neurobiology.

1922
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
In fact, it doesn't seem to have much to do with it.

1923
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So I think about the cross-field.

1924
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Is it good?

1925
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
OK.

1926
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So what is everyone's approach?

1927
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's usually not so exaggerated.

1928
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Mine is more like a 90-degree turn.

1929
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The general practice is probably.

1930
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's amazing to turn 30 degrees.

1931
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That's a safer way.

1932
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
OK.

1933
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Because basically.

1934
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think even if you only turn 30 degrees.

1935
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
OK.

1936
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Then expand your research scope.

1937
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This thing is actually quite difficult.

1938
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yes.

1939
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What about the time?

1940
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Of course, it's a very, very important factor.

1941
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
OK.

1942
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I think I can be a postdoc for so long.

1943
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
The main reason is because.

1944
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I have a very supportive family.

1945
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
With a very supportive advisor.

1946
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
OK.

1947
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Inevitable.

1948
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
If you say you are missing one.

1949
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's not going to work.

1950
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
OK.

1951
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You are going to live in hell.

1952
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
OK.

1953
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So I don't recommend everyone.

1954
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Is to make such a drastic change.

1955
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yes.

1956
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
What are the benefits?

1957
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
The benefit is that when you come to life.

1958
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
You become very unique.

1959
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
OK.

1960
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You can easily find some on research.

1961
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Scientific niche.

1962
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That you can be the only one.

1963
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Who can do this.

1964
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
OK.

1965
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That will become a very good one.

1966
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
If you can survive.

1967
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Then you can live relatively easily.

1968
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Because you start to define the field.

1969
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
OK.

1970
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Because no one is doing that.

1971
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
You are the only one.

1972
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Then you define the field.

1973
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Right.

1974
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
If you are the first one.

1975
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Who define the field.

1976
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Then people follow you.

1977
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Then.

1978
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Things is actually easier.

1979
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
OK.

1980
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But if you say.

1981
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You just follow the direction of others.

1982
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Then you will start.

1983
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You need to be very careful.

1984
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Because.

1985
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Whatever you say.

1986
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
OK.

1987
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
There will always be someone.

1988
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Researcher.

1989
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Start arguing with you.

1990
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes.

1991
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So.

1992
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
The advantage of doing cross-field research is.

1993
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You may be easier to find.

1994
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
A scientific niche.

1995
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
To contribute.

1996
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
What you have learned.

1997
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It is also easier to find new knowledge.

1998
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Come.

1999
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Push the front of the field.

2000
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
OK.

2001
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So I think that is a big plus.

2002
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
OK.

2003
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
When doing this.

2004
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Because you changed the field.

2005
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The corresponding price is.

2006
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The cost of time.

2007
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
OK.

2008
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The cost of time.

2009
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Can you accept it?

2010
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Can your family accept it?

2011
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Right.

2012
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Is your teacher willing to accept it?

2013
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Then this thing.

2014
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It becomes natural.

2015
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Like I said.

2016
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Like I said.

2017
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I think I am a lucky person.

2018
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because.

2019
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
My wife is very, very supportive.

2020
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
OK.

2021
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
My family is very, very, very supportive.

2022
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That.

2023
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
My researcher boss.

2024
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I am a post office boss.

2025
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Tell me directly.

2026
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Wife, how long do you want to stay?

2027
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yes.

2028
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So.

2029
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It creates a.

2030
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I think.

2031
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I can do this.

2032
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
OK.

2033
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The point is.

2034
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
When I do this.

2035
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
How do I feel?

2036
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Do I still enjoy this process?

2037
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think that's the point.

2038
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
If I don't enjoy this process.

2039
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I have to force myself to turn around.

2040
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I think that's the meaning.

2041
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Right.

2042
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So.

2043
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Generally speaking.

2044
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think.

2045
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
If you really want to do cross-field.

2046
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Don't turn so much.

2047
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
OK.

2048
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Turn 30 degrees.

2049
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
OK.

2050
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's quite similar to what you did before.

2051
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I think it's already a pretty good one.

2052
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Uh.

2053
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It should also be said that it is a more reasonable approach.

2054
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
OK.

2055
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The feasibility is also a little higher.

2056
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
OK.

2057
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Compared to your other requirements.

2058
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Maybe you can lose a little bit.

2059
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Then I think.

2060
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Is a good way.

2061
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Right.

2062
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
That.

2063
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
No.

2064
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
There is another.

2065
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
What other questions are there?

2066
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I said.

2067
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Is to.

2068
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Comment on the interdisciplinary research.

2069
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Then.

2070
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The general.

2071
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Thinking about.

2072
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The.

2073
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
How you should actually do that.

2074
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So that.

2075
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You know.

2076
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It has a higher chance to.

2077
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Make it work.

2078
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
OK.

2079
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So I think.

2080
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Don't turn too much.

2081
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That.

2082
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But you have to turn.

2083
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
OK.

2084
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.

2085
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.

2086
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
When you are looking for a teacher later.

2087
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
You will definitely be asked the question.

2088
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Is.

2089
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
How do you.

2090
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
With your previous.

2091
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Uh.

2092
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
PEI group.

2093
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Compete.

2094
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
OK.

2095
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So I think the cross-field thing.

2096
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Must be done.

2097
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Because.

2098
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
In the single field.

2099
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
In fact.

2100
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Simple things.

2101
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Everyone is basically done.

2102
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Right.

2103
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Ah.

2104
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If it's too difficult.

2105
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
When you start.

2106
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Your faculty position.

2107
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You don't have that much time to spend.

2108
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Right.

2109
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Right.

2110
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
If you want to survive.

2111
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
If.

2112
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I think.

2113
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That's not a good approach.

2114
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So.

2115
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Involve some new things.

2116
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I think it's a.

2117
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Good direction.

2118
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
OK.

2119
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
How much do you want to involve?

2120
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It depends on the individual's own conditions.

2121
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I hope this answer.

2122
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

2123
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I probably have some ideas.

2124
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That.

2125
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Another question.

2126
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I mainly want to ask the teacher.

2127
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
That is.

2128
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
About.

2129
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Uh.

2130
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Decide the academic world.

2131
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Stay in the academic world.

2132
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Continue to try.

2133
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Or.

2134
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Uh.

2135
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
To go to the industry.

2136
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
That.

2137
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
This is.

2138
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Uh.

2139
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Uh.

2140
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Uh.

2141
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Uh.

2142
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Uh.

2143
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Uh.

2144
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Uh.

2145
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This time point.

2146
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
With a change of mentality.

2147
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Is there any.

2148
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Is there.

2149
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The first one is.

2150
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Is there a clear time point?

2151
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That is.

2152
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
When do you need.

2153
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Meta decision.

2154
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That's another one.

2155
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Is there anything.

2156
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
How to say.

2157
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Is the point to be decided.

2158
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And the direction of the decision.

2159
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
About.

2160
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This issue.

2161
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Is.

2162
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't know if the teacher has any suggestions.

2163
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I think.

2164
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Of course.

2165
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's just me.

2166
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
OK.

2167
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
If.

2168
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You start looking for.

2169
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
OK.

2170
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That.

2171
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
When you're in the first year.

2172
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
When.

2173
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
If you say.

2174
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You have found the interview.

2175
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
If the opportunity.

2176
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
OK.

2177
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But you didn't go.

2178
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
That.

2179
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
The second year.

2180
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You have more interview opportunities.

2181
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
But you haven't.

2182
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That.

2183
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I think you can.

2184
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Concede.

2185
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Turn to the industry.

2186
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That.

2187
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The reason I say that.

2188
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Mainly because.

2189
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
In my opinion.

2190
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's.

2191
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's.

2192
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It's.

2193
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's.

2194
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It's.

2195
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It's.

2196
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It's.

2197
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Mainly because.

2198
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
In the example I see.

2199
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Once you.

2200
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Fail for twice.

2201
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
OK.

2202
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You have to find another.

2203
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Uh.

2204
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Uh.

2205
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Uh.

2206
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Uh.

2207
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Uh.

2208
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Uh.

2209
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Uh.

2210
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Uh.

2211
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Uh.

2212
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Uh.

2213
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Uh.

2214
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Uh.

2215
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Uh.

2216
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Uh.

2217
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Uh.

2218
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Uh.

2219
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Uh.

2220
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Uh.

2221
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Uh.

2222
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Uh.

2223
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Uh.

2224
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Uh.

2225
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Uh.

2226
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Uh.

2227
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Uh.

2228
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Uh.

2229
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Uh.

2230
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Uh.

2231
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Uh.

2232
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Uh.

2233
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Uh.

2234
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Uh.

2235
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Uh.

2236
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Uh.

2237
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Uh.

2238
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Uh.

2239
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Uh.

2240
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Uh.

2241
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Uh.

2242
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Uh.

2243
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Uh.

2244
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Uh.

2245
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Uh.

2246
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Uh.

2247
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Uh.

2248
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Uh.

2249
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Uh.

2250
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Uh.

2251
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Uh.

2252
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Uh.

2253
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Uh.

2254
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Uh.

2255
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Uh.

2256
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Uh.

2257
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So my personal feeling, again, my personal feeling.

2258
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:47,000
If you are in the second year, if you have the opportunity to interview for the second time, but you still don't have the position, then I guess that maybe there are some things that we did not realize, but other, uh.

2259
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Uh.

2260
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Uh, so the committee that you see might be a problem, so I think it might be a matter of whether to think about whether to change the career path that would be more suitable for yourself.

2261
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Ok, after all, uh, I just talked to everybody. Ok, this matter of education is actually the condition itself. Of course, it's important, but we all think it's great, it's almost 50 percent.

2262
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
The other 50 percent is more related to the formation of the committee of the direction of the department.

2263
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So if you say that it's not very smooth when you're looking for a teacher, you don't have to be too depressed.

2264
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You just didn't meet the right search committee at the right time.

2265
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Ok, then the department did not provide you with the direction of the department and your direction did not match.

2266
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Ok, it's less simple. It's not that you are not good enough. Ok, so I think the change in mentality does not have to be denied.

2267
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Ok, then I think that if you want to consider it bad luck, I think it's totally fine.

2268
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Ok, it's really just that this thing is too complicated and involves too many factors.

2269
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Ok, it's not that I'm going to do my best and I'm going to have a position, it's not like that.

2270
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yes, I have a lot of friends who perform better than me in science.

2271
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
In the end, they just don't have a position.

2272
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Then you would say that I am better than them. I don't think so either.

2273
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
They just don't have the position they want when they vote.

2274
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That fit is not very good.

2275
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Then this kind of person goes to the industry, I think they will be crazy, because they are really good.

2276
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So I think that if you say that you are not good at the academic world and transfer to the industry, I don't think it's a sad thing.

2277
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I don't think it's necessary, because you have a very good platform that can really let you shine.

2278
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ok, thank you for your answer. I think maybe let everyone ask.

2279
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Do you have any questions?

2280
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I very much agree.

2281
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:06,000
When we were just talking about finding a faculty position, the component of luck is really big.

2282
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
In addition to the search committee of the other school, who will compete with you that year?

2283
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
This thing is also different every year.

2284
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Can I comment on the search committee?

2285
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
We just talked about outreach.

2286
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
At the beginning, we were focusing on graduate student outreach, right?

2287
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You have to do this more thoroughly when you are a postdoc.

2288
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Because you need more recognition letters.

2289
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So you really need to get to know the people in your field.

2290
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It will make it easier for you when you are a postdoc.

2291
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That's right.

2292
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It seems that someone just wanted to ask a question.

2293
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Is it?

2294
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Hello, I am.

2295
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the United States.

2296
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I have been studying for four years.

2297
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I think what I just shared is a lot of success.

2298
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Mainly because I am now in a research proposal stage.

2299
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:30,000
What I want to ask is how to set the vision goal when writing a proposal.

2300
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I don't want it to be too big that I can't control it.

2301
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But I don't want it to be too small that there is no room for it.

2302
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I want to set a goal and a vision.

2303
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,000
My main career goal is to achieve my goal.

2304
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
If that's the case, what should I set?

2305
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
A PSD proposal goal and vision.

2306
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I think this should be your boss's job.

2307
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:19,000
My suggestion is to write out the outline first.

2308
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Then discuss it with your teacher.

2309
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
The teacher will provide some reasonable judgment.

2310
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
After all, it's your major.

2311
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's hard for me to give you meaningful comments here.

2312
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But I think in general, I will ask my students to show me what they think.

2313
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Let's discuss and see if what you think is reasonable.

2314
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I think you need to practice more on writing outlines.

2315
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Think about your significance.

2316
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
When you write something, is it significant?

2317
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
In the end, when you write a proposal, significance is the most important factor.

2318
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
After thinking about your significance,

2319
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
How do you approach this problem?

2320
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's worth thinking about.

2321
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I think the earlier you write out your outline,

2322
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's best to discuss with your teacher as soon as possible.

2323
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Because your teacher can make the most reasonable comment about your research significance.

2324
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If your teacher doesn't think your significance is high,

2325
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I think you can change the topic as soon as possible.

2326
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I think writing a proposal is something you might want to specialize in later.

2327
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I don't think many doctoral students have the experience of writing a proposal.

2328
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.

2329
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
If you have a chance, I suggest you try to write a proposal.

2330
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
When you're writing your proposal experiment,

2331
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
There's a little bit of that feeling.

2332
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I think you can take this opportunity to make it more complete.

2333
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.

2334
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Is that okay?

2335
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Yes, thank you.

2336
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I have another question.

2337
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,000
How independent should PhD students be?

2338
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:10,000
How independent should PhD students be?

2339
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
This is related to PhDs.

2340
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Every lab is different.

2341
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But I found one thing.

2342
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I think teachers and students need some time to build their mutual trust.

2343
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
If you have mutual trust,

2344
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I think if you want to provide enough evidence to support your argument,

2345
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
The boss usually won't be too strongly opposed.

2346
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
If the boss has a strong desire to oppose what you propose,

2347
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That means you haven't reached that level in his heart.

2348
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
How do you build mutual trust?

2349
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I think it's very important to have the ability to experiment.

2350
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And can you clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do?

2351
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,000
If you can clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do,

2352
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Even if the project doesn't work, the teacher is still willing to trust you.

2353
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So I think it takes some incubation time to build that trust.

2354
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:31,000
That incubation time depends on whether the students are really professional when presenting their results.

2355
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I think it's usually the general teacher.

2356
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Of course, some teachers are exceptions.

2357
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
If the general teacher sees that students can really be responsible for what they do,

2358
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And can really make things clear, complete and reasonable,

2359
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Then I guess if you want to do a new project in the lab later,

2360
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Or if you come up with something and you want to continue,

2361
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The teacher will have a higher chance of agreeing.

2362
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Otherwise, in fact, on the practical operating surface,

2363
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
The problem is that the teacher's funding is actually for specific projects.

2364
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So sometimes they can't deviate.

2365
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
If you propose a proposal and it deviates too far from the original proposal,

2366
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
He may not be able to provide financial support.

2367
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It's not that he doesn't trust you, he just doesn't have the potential.

2368
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Does that make sense?

2369
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

2370
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Thank you very much.

2371
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Then my question ends here.

2372
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Okay, everyone should have heard me talk just now.

2373
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That's the end of our Q&A session.

2374
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Then everyone will turn on the microphone again.

2375
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Let's applaud and thank Taiyan.

2376
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Thank you, everyone.

2377
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Thank you, everyone.
