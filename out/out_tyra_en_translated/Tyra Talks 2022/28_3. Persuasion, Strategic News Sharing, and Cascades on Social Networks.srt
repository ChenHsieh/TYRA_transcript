1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you all for participating in today's Project T.R.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I am the host today.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I am Kao-Hsien, Ph.D. student at RUAN University.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today's speaker is Jin Jiang.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Jin Jiang is a PhD candidate at MIT.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before joining MIT,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
he obtained a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at NTU.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His research focuses on human decision-making

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and how people interact with social media.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Especially when social media is full of real and fake news,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
how do people interact with social media?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How does human behavior evolve into a large-scale social phenomenon?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
These are the topics he is interested in.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He will use different theories and research methods

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to explore his research interests.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today, we invite him to talk about

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the topic of persuasion,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
strategic news sharing,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and social media.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Without further ado,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
let's welcome Jin Jiang to give his presentation.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Jin Jiang, the floor is yours.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you Kao-Hsien for the introduction.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello everyone.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am currently studying at MIT.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is my last year.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Today, I would like to introduce my project,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Persuasion, News Sharing and Cascade on Social Networks.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is a joint work with my postdoc, Amir Ajalloh,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and my advisor, Ali Jawadbhai.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am currently studying at the Engineering School.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
However, I focus on Economic Theory.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's get started.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ever since social media was invented,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
people have changed the way they consume news.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
One-fifth of Americans say

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
they usually receive news from social media.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Social media also promotes peer-to-peer interaction.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It also accelerates the flow of information.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We also found that

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
on social media,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you are passively receiving information.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your friends decide to share news with you

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
or these algorithms promote news to you.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They subjectively choose to receive news from you.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
On social media,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
they want to make money.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When they distribute advertisements,

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
they may also amplify misinformation on the platform.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Today, I want to study

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
why people share news.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a very important question in the academic world.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do people share news to tell others

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
or express their opinions?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or do they want to find a peer?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or do they want to persuade others?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In addition,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what kind of news

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
will be popular on social media?

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For example,

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
what is the impact of credibility?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How does it affect

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:52,000
the characteristics of society?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
From an economist's perspective,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
some psychologists study

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
whether there is any behavioral bias.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Political scientists focus on misinformation

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and political influence.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In the case of two parties,

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
they may be more willing to share

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
news related to their party.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How do they view news related to their party?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is it more credible or less?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In this field,

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
they still rely on CS to help.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They still do computational things.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My question today is

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
based on a question.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If the motivation of sharing news

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
is to get your followers closer to you,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
what will happen?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This model is a what-if question.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If the motivation is to get your followers

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
closer to you,

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
what kind of news will you share?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And what kind of news

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
will be popular in what kind of society?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
OK.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
As I said,

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm using an economist's perspective

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to answer this question.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Next, I will talk about this model

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
using the so-called competition theory.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In addition,

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
this work has been submitted

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to the Journal of Economics Theory.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is a link of SSR here.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you are interested in the journal version,

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
please scan the QR code.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
First, I will talk about

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
some major assumptions of this model.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Of course, we will consider a society

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
where everyone has a different view.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We are not all the same.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We are all left-wing or right-wing.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We all have different views.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Everyone hopes that

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
their peers' views are similar to theirs.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In addition,

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the word persuasion we use here

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
means that

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you give others an objective information,

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
a new information,

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to influence their belief.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When I talk about persuasion,

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean this.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In addition,

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
when sharing,

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
there will be some costs.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can think of it like this.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I was scrolling my phone,

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I suddenly felt like

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I wanted to spread this news.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I thought about it.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were scrolling your phone,

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and then you suddenly stopped.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The model has a small cost.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because of this small cost,

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
we call it

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
strategic substitute in economics.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When others do this,

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you don't want to do it

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
because you think others will do it for you.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In order to save that cost,

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you may think that

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
if others have spread this news,

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't need to spread it.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In addition,

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will apply this model to a society

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
with two-party differentiation.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In a society with two-party differentiation,

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
what will cause

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
inaccurate news

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to spread

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
further than accurate news?

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
OK.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Sorry, can I ask a question?

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Can I interrupt?

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's OK.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We should be fine.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to ask

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the relationship between 2 and 3.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if I share something

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
on social media,

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I hope

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that I am in the same class.

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
At this time,

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the persuasion we talk about

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
seems to be different from

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the usual persuasion we imagine.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
For example,

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
if I am in the same class,

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and I post something,

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
my understanding will be

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
or I will hope

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
they will accept it.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There is not much persuasion.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Usually,

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the persuasion we imagine

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is that those people

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
may be neutral

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
or even have a different

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
point of view

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
from me.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then I share

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
some new information

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
to convince them

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to join my camp.

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So,

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
if

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
your model

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is that

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
everyone wants to

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
stay in the same class,

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
then the persuasion

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
will be

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
relatively weaker.

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry,

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I may not have explained

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the second point.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The second point is not

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that you want to be in the same class,

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but that

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
my motivation is

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that I hope

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
other people

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
have the same idea as me.

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh,

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I see.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So,

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you hope

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
other people's ideas

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
are the same as yours.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh,

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I see.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So,

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am just explaining.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay,

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
thank you.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sorry,

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I didn't understand.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's okay.

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have a question.

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Does the persuasion

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
communication mechanism

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
here

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
matter

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
one-to-one

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
or one-to-many?

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh,

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that's a good question.

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So,

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the persuasion here is

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because

227
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
our model

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is more like

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Twitter.

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So,

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you want to say

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
once I share this news,

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
all your friends

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
will see it.

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes,

236
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
it's a simple

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
something

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
called broadcast.

239
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Once I share it,

240
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can...

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I know

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
all my friends

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
will see it.

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So,

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
there will be

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
a strategic substitute

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
because

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
others can broadcast.

249
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay,

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I see.

252
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes,

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that's a good question.

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So,

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
you don't have to

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
choose

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
who you want to

259
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
share it to.

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just decide

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to share it

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and I know

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
all my followers

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
will see it.

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes.

266
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

267
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
here

269
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is a

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
broad picture

271
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
about

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
our main

273
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
result.

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
First,

275
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
of course,

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we designed

277
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the equilibrium

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it includes

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
identifying

281
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
everyone

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
sharing news.

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So,

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
this is

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the motivation

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
of persuasion.

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But,

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if you decompose it

289
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and analyze it,

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you will find that

291
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
people who are

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
more extreme

293
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
will want

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to

295
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
share news

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
more actively.

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And,

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
of course,

299
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
sharing news

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
is aligned

301
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
with my ideas.

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If I am

303
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
a right-wing extremist,

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will

305
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
share

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
right-wing news.

307
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I won't

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
share

309
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
left-wing news.

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Another one is

311
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
persuasiveness of news.

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Once I

313
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
share news,

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can change

315
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
people's

316
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
beliefs.

317
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
For example,

318
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
if I keep

319
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
sharing news,

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
no one will

321
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
believe it

322
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and no one

323
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
will change

324
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
their ideas,

325
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
why should I

326
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
share news?

327
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The last one is

328
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
strategic substitute.

329
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When you

330
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
share news,

331
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you will

332
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
evaluate

333
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
how many

334
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
people

335
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
are sharing

336
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
news

337
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
under

338
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
equilibrium.

339
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Then,

340
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you will

341
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
think that

342
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
most people

343
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
will hear

344
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the news

345
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
so I don't

346
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
need to share it.

347
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
These are

348
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the three main

349
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
components.

350
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Can you

351
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
clarify

352
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the concept

353
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
of

354
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
equilibrium?

355
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh,

356
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the concept

357
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
of

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
equilibrium

359
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is that

360
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
under

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
this model,

362
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
you

363
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
predict

364
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
what

365
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
others

366
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
are doing.

367
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then,

368
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
under

369
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
your prediction,

370
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
you

371
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
optimize

372
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
your behavior.

373
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If

374
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
everyone

375
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
goes to

376
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the supermarket

377
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
to buy

378
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
everything,

379
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I will

380
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
also go

381
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to the

382
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
supermarket

383
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to buy

384
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
everything

385
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and go to

386
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the supermarket

387
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
to buy

388
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
things.

389
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So,

390
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
under

391
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
your

392
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
prediction,

393
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you will

394
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
do

395
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the best

396
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
behavior

397
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
for you.

398
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
At the same time,

399
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
under

400
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
your

401
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
prediction,

402
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you will

403
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
optimize

404
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
your

405
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
behavior.

406
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So,

407
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
under

408
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
this kind

409
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
of interaction,

410
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it reaches

411
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
equilibrium.

412
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In this

413
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
case,

414
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
no one

415
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
will

416
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
change

417
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
their

418
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
behavior.

419
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So,

420
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
it gradually

421
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
reaches

422
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
equilibrium.

423
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's not

424
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
gradually

425
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
reaching

426
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
equilibrium,

427
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but

428
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it's

429
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
a

430
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
very

431
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
basic

432
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
assumption.

433
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's

434
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
not an

435
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
assumption,

436
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it's

437
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
a

438
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
game.

439
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In

440
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the

441
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
game,

442
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
it's

443
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
like

444
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
playing

445
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
poker.

446
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I will

447
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
think of

448
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the

449
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
moves

450
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and

451
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I will

452
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
think of

453
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
how to

454
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
resist

455
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
them.

456
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If

457
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I

458
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
predict

459
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
your

460
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
behavior,

461
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
under

462
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
equilibrium,

463
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will

464
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
think of

465
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
how to

466
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
react.

467
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No one

468
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
will

469
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
change

470
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
their

471
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
behavior.

472
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It

473
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
reaches

474
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
a balance

475
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
of

476
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
resistance.

477
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So,

478
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we

479
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
need to

480
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
make it

481
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
equilibrium.

482
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I see.

483
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have a

484
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
question.

485
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
For example,

486
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
if I

487
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
don't

488
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
talk,

489
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
but

490
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the other

491
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
person

492
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
talks or

493
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
doesn't

494
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
talk,

495
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it's better

496
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
for me.

497
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So,

498
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will

499
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
talk.

500
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If the

501
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
other person

502
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
talks or

503
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
doesn't

504
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
talk,

505
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it's

506
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
better for

507
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
me.

508
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I see.

509
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

510
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have a

511
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
question

512
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
about

513
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
equilibrium.

514
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When

515
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you

516
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
discuss

517
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
individual

518
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
differences,

519
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
does everyone

520
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
look different?

521
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In

522
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Econ,

523
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
they call

524
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it

525
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
type.

526
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What

527
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
type are

528
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you?

529
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You

530
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
can consider

531
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
individual

532
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
differences,

533
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
but

534
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Econ

535
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
often

536
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
asks

537
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
whether

538
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
