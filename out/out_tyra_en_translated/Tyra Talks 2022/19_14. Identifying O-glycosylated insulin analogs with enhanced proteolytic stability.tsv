0	6000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's TARA Talk.
6000	11000	TARA stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.
11000	15000	It is a friendly forum for young researchers in Taiwan.
15000	22000	We hold TARA Talk every week and every weekend throughout the year.
22000	27000	The format and content of this talk are very free and diverse.
27000	33000	Researchers can share their academic achievements,
33000	36000	practice online presentations,
36000	40000	or get to know potential future collaborators.
40000	43000	Today's speaker is...
43000	49000	Wei-Zhe, would you like to share your screen?
49000	50000	Okay.
58000	60000	Is it on?
60000	61000	Yes, it is.
61000	64000	Today's speaker is Wei-Zhe Xu.
64000	71000	He is currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder
71000	80000	in Chemical and Biological Engineering.
80000	88000	Today's talk is on Identifying Signature of...
88000	91000	Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce that word.
91000	98000	Protolytic Stability and Dimerization Properties.
98000	100000	He is a simulator.
100000	105000	He gave a wonderful talk at TARA.
105000	108000	As usual at TARA,
108000	110000	before the talk starts,
110000	120000	we will turn on the microphone and give a warm welcome to Wei-Zhe.
127000	129000	Okay, thank you.
129000	132000	Should I start?
132000	134000	Yes, you can start.
135000	137000	Hello everyone, I am Wei-Zhe Xu.
137000	143000	I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder.
143000	147000	My main interest in this course is to use...
147000	149000	computer molecular dynamics simulations...
149000	152000	to study different biological and physical phenomena...
152000	154000	or develop related algorithms.
154000	159000	Thank you for coming to this talk.
159000	166000	Today's talk is similar to the one I gave at TARA.
166000	171000	This is my first time to use Chinese...
171000	175000	to explain this academic research.
175000	179000	Please let me know if you have any questions.
179000	181000	It's okay to interrupt me.
181000	185000	Without further ado, let's get started.
185000	187000	Today we are going to discuss...
187000	190000	how to use computer simulation...
190000	193000	to find out the factors that affect...
193000	195000	the properties of the permutations.
195000	199000	Before we get into today's topic,
199000	202000	let's take a look at what a permutation looks like.
202000	205000	A permutation is a protein molecule.
205000	208000	It is composed of two amino acids.
208000	212000	The blue one and the yellow one.
212000	214000	They are chain A and chain B.
214000	218000	You may have heard of it.
218000	220000	The biggest relationship between a permutation and humans...
220000	225000	is that it is widely used in diabetes treatment.
225000	229000	For example, there are 34 million people in the US...
229000	231000	who are diabetic.
231000	234000	7 million of them use permutations...
234000	236000	as their main treatment method.
236000	239000	Most of the treatment channels for permutations...
239000	242000	are done through subcutaneous injection.
242000	244000	Diabetic patients...
244000	248000	usually need to be injected 30 minutes before meals.
248000	250000	This means that diabetes patients...
250000	254000	need to be injected 2-3 times a day.
254000	258000	If you need to be injected 2-3 times a day,
258000	260000	it will be very uncomfortable.
260000	263000	The biggest drawback of subcutaneous injection...
263000	266000	is that it is very invasive.
266000	268000	In the past 20 years,
268000	271000	scientists have tried to develop...
271000	274000	non-invasive treatment channels...
274000	279000	to reduce the use of subcutaneous injection.
279000	284000	One of the most potential treatment channels...
284000	286000	is the so-called oral-diphtheria.
286000	288000	20 years have passed.
288000	290000	This research has been going on for more than 20 years.
290000	292000	Why is it that...
292000	295000	we don't hear much about...
295000	298000	oral-diphtheria drugs on the market?
298000	300000	The reason is that...
300000	302000	the development of oral-diphtheria drugs...
302000	305000	has many major challenges.
305000	307000	Most of these challenges...
307000	310000	come from the digestive system of the human body.
310000	314000	The first challenge is that...
314000	317000	when the gastrointestinal tract goes through the human stomach,
317000	320000	gastric acid will destroy the gastrointestinal structure.
320000	323000	The gastrointestinal tract will lose its function.
323000	325000	Basically, this challenge...
325000	327000	has been completely solved...
327000	331000	some time ago.
331000	333000	Most of the mainstream use...
333000	337000	is to use some special materials to protect the gastrointestinal tract.
337000	340000	The gastrointestinal tract can...
340000	342000	This special material...
342000	344000	will not be dissolved in the case of acidity.
344000	346000	This can protect the gastrointestinal tract...
346000	349000	from being corroded by gastric acid.
349000	351000	When leaving the stomach,
351000	353000	the gastrointestinal tract...
353000	355000	will be dissolved.
355000	357000	The gastrointestinal tract will be dissolved.
357000	359000	The drug will be released.
359000	362000	The first challenge has been solved.
362000	364000	But it was a major challenge...
364000	366000	in the development of oral-diphtheria drugs.
366000	368000	The next two challenges...
368000	370000	have not been completely solved yet.
370000	372000	The first challenge is that...
372000	375000	the stability of the gastrointestinal system is not very good.
375000	377000	The reason is that...
377000	379000	many digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal system...
379000	381000	destroy the gastrointestinal tract.
381000	383000	This will also cause the gastrointestinal tract to lose its function.
383000	385000	In addition, the gastrointestinal tract...
385000	387000	is not very transparent to the cell membrane.
387000	389000	Usually, we will see that...
389000	391000	two gastrointestinal molecules...
391000	393000	may gather together...
393000	395000	and then...
395000	398000	become a so-called gastrointestinal 2-gene.
398000	400000	This 2-gene...
400000	402000	is a relatively large molecule.
402000	405000	So it is more difficult to pass through the cell membrane.
405000	407000	The human body's absorption...
407000	409000	of gastrointestinal 2-gene...
409000	411000	will also become lower.
411000	413000	So the following two challenges...
413000	415000	have not been completely solved yet.
415000	417000	Therefore, if we want to develop oral-diphtheria drugs,
417000	419000	we know that...
419000	421000	we hope that oral-diphtheria drugs...
421000	423000	will achieve at least two goals.
423000	425000	The first goal is that...
425000	427000	we hope that it has enough resistance...
427000	429000	to the digestive enzymes in the human body.
429000	431000	The second goal is that...
431000	433000	we hope that it has a relatively low gathering tendency...
433000	435000	so that it is easier to reach a higher absorption...
435000	437000	of gastrointestinal 2-gene.
437000	439000	In the past few years,
439000	441000	there have been a lot of different research methods...
441000	443000	to experiment with...
443000	445000	how to achieve these two goals at the same time.
445000	447000	A few years ago,
447000	449000	in a chemistry synthesis lab...
449000	451000	that we worked with,
451000	453000	they found that...
453000	455000	in a specific location of the gastrointestinal tract,
455000	457000	a specific type of sugar can be added...
457000	459000	to improve...
459000	461000	the gastrointestinal tract's resistance...
461000	463000	to enzymes.
463000	465000	In addition,
465000	467000	it can effectively reduce its gathering tendency.
467000	469000	This method is called sugarification.
469000	471000	Basically,
471000	473000	it is the structure of...
473000	475000	a sugar molecule...
475000	477000	connected to a gastrointestinal tract.
477000	479000	In the research...
479000	481000	conducted by our laboratory,
481000	483000	they studied a total of 12 different...
483000	485000	gastrointestinal tracts.
485000	487000	You can see that...
487000	489000	these 12 gastrointestinal tracts...
489000	491000	basically have three control mutations.
491000	493000	The first one is...
493000	495000	the location of sugarification.
495000	497000	Here, you can see...
497000	499000	my mouse.
499000	501000	This is the structure of the gastrointestinal tract.
501000	503000	These balls...
503000	505000	are basically the amino acids...
505000	507000	that can be sugarified.
507000	509000	There are a total of 51 amino acids in the gastrointestinal tract.
509000	511000	Only five of them...
511000	513000	can be added to sugar.
513000	515000	The first mutation is...
515000	517000	the location of sugarification.
517000	519000	The second mutation is...
519000	521000	the type of sugar.
521000	523000	For example, we can see here...
523000	525000	GALNAC.
525000	527000	In English, it's N-Acetyl Glycosamin.
527000	529000	I'm not sure how to say it in Chinese,
529000	531000	but it's a type of sugar.
531000	533000	The other type of sugar is MANOS.
533000	535000	The main purpose is to study...
535000	537000	the sugarification mechanism of these two types of sugar.
537000	539000	The third type is...
539000	541000	the size of the type of sugar.
541000	543000	You can see that the last few types of sugar...
543000	545000	from the 7th to the 13th...
545000	547000	basically use MANOS...
547000	549000	as the base of the type of sugar.
549000	551000	They may use the type of sugar...
551000	553000	the type of MANOS...
553000	555000	the type of MANOS-2 or type of MANOS-3...
555000	557000	to modify the structure of the amino acid.
557000	559000	For example,
559000	561000	you can see that...
561000	563000	the picture here...
563000	565000	is the structure of a sugarified amino acid.
565000	567000	The blue and yellow...
567000	569000	are the amino acids.
569000	571000	The purple is...
571000	573000	the type of MANOS-3.
573000	575000	The location of sugarification...
575000	577000	is the B27 amino acid.
577000	579000	OK.
579000	581000	So...
581000	583000	in our...
583000	585000	collaborative lab...
585000	587000	research,
587000	589000	how did they...
589000	591000	from these different sugarified amino acids...
591000	593000	find a structure...
593000	595000	that is more likely to be used as an amino acid...
595000	597000	for oral medication?
597000	599000	They did a series of experiments.
599000	601000	Today, I'm going to talk about the most important one.
601000	603000	First of all,
603000	605000	they measured the resistance of the amino acids.
605000	607000	Basically,
607000	609000	I put the amino acids...
609000	611000	and the sugarified amino acids...
611000	613000	in the same solution...
613000	615000	to monitor...
615000	617000	when the amino acid...
617000	619000	is cut off.
619000	621000	Then, we can measure...
621000	623000	how long it takes...
623000	625000	for the sugarified amino acids...
625000	627000	to be broken down by the amino acids.
627000	629000	The time it takes...
629000	631000	is called alpha-contription half-life.
631000	633000	Alpha-contription half-life...
633000	635000	is the amino acid...
635000	637000	that our collaborative lab uses.
637000	639000	It can break down the amino acids.
639000	641000	Half-life means...
641000	643000	the amino acids...
643000	645000	are cut into two parts.
645000	647000	So, they lose some of their quality.
647000	649000	The weight is reduced.
649000	651000	So, we can detect...
651000	653000	the amino acids.
653000	655000	Basically, the longer it takes...
655000	657000	means that the amino acids...
657000	659000	need to break down the amino acids.
659000	661000	The longer it takes...
661000	663000	means that the structure of the amino acids...
663000	665000	is more resistant to the amino acids.
665000	667000	On the far left, we can see...
667000	669000	the so-called wild-type.
669000	671000	It's a circular amino acid.
671000	673000	It doesn't go through any type of sugar.
673000	675000	We can see that...
675000	677000	in the 12 types of amino acids...
677000	679000	the numbers 9, 10, and 13...
679000	681000	are the half-life...
681000	683000	of the alpha-contription half-life.
683000	685000	This means that...
685000	687000	the amino acids need to break down...
687000	689000	the amino acids...
689000	691000	for a longer time.
691000	693000	This means that...
693000	695000	the amino acids are more resistant to the amino acids.
695000	697000	The important ones are 10 and 13.
697000	699000	9 is a little bit higher than the wild-type.
699000	701000	10 and 13 are significantly better...
701000	703000	than the circular amino acids.
703000	705000	Coincidentally,
705000	707000	these three structures...
707000	709000	also have...
709000	711000	relatively low...
711000	713000	relative gathering tendency.
713000	715000	On the right,
715000	717000	you can see that...
717000	719000	the wild-type is on the far left.
719000	721000	The three on the right are 9, 10, and 13.
721000	723000	The blue part of the graph...
723000	725000	shows the ratio of the amino acids.
725000	727000	The green part...
727000	729000	shows the ratio of the half-life.
729000	731000	We hope that...
731000	733000	the lower the relative gathering tendency,
733000	735000	the better.
735000	737000	The higher the amino acid ratio,
737000	739000	the better.
739000	741000	We can see that...
741000	743000	9, 10, and 13...
743000	745000	are more resistant to the amino acids.
745000	747000	We can see that...
747000	749000	these three amino acids...
749000	751000	have relatively low relative gathering tendency.
751000	753000	What is the most important discovery...
753000	755000	of this study?
755000	757000	The most important discovery is that...
757000	759000	if you look at the structure of 9, 10, and 13,
759000	761000	its name is a little bit long.
761000	763000	It's a little bit strange.
763000	765000	But from its name,
765000	767000	you can probably tell that...
767000	769000	these three structures...
769000	771000	are all in the position of...
771000	773000	the B27.
773000	775000	The group that is connected to the B27...
775000	777000	are the single-unit...
777000	779000	2-gene...
779000	781000	or 3-gene.
781000	783000	So, the most important discovery...
783000	785000	of this study is that...
785000	787000	scientists found that...
787000	789000	among these 10 kinds of...
789000	791000	amino acids,
791000	793000	if we connect the single-unit...
793000	795000	2-gene...
795000	797000	or 3-gene to the B27,
797000	799000	it can effectively improve the quality...
799000	801000	of the amino acids.
801000	803000	It is more suitable to be used...
803000	805000	as an oral medication.
805000	807000	We already know that...
807000	809000	in the experiment...
809000	811000	in the general chemical synthesis experiment,
811000	813000	we are likely to be able to...
813000	815000	experiment with a dozen kinds of...
815000	817000	amino acids one by one...
817000	819000	and then synthesize them one by one.
819000	821000	Then compare them one by one with wild-type...
821000	823000	to identify which amino acid...
823000	825000	has the best quality.
825000	827000	But if we want to find...
827000	829000	the best amino acid for oral medication,
829000	831000	if we want to find the best...
831000	833000	amino acid,
833000	835000	do we need to synthesize...
835000	837000	thousands of kinds of...
837000	839000	amino acids?
839000	841000	Of course, this process...
841000	843000	is very time-consuming.
843000	845000	Usually, to synthesize...
845000	847000	an amino acid...
847000	849000	that does not exist in the natural world,
849000	851000	it may take a few months.
851000	853000	If it is long, it may take 1-2 years.
853000	855000	So, when...
855000	857000	chemical synthesizers...
857000	859000	synthesize these amino acids,
859000	861000	they think that...
861000	863000	this is too much trouble...
863000	865000	and too much time...
865000	867000	and too much money.
867000	869000	Then they start to think that...
869000	871000	if I can't quickly and efficiently...
871000	873000	use chemical synthesis to complete this thing,
873000	875000	I don't know if computer simulation...
875000	877000	can do this thing.
877000	879000	That's why...
879000	881000	our co-worker...
881000	883000	came to us...
883000	885000	to do a computer simulation.
885000	887000	The answer to this question is...
887000	889000	of course, it's possible.
889000	891000	We can use computer simulation...
891000	893000	to predict...
893000	895000	which of the selected...
895000	897000	amino acids...
897000	899000	may contain the best...
899000	901000	amino acid.
901000	903000	Our simulation method...
903000	905000	is called molecular thermodynamics simulation.
905000	907000	Molecular thermodynamics simulation...
907000	909000	is a very vast subject.
909000	911000	It has a lot of...
911000	913000	hundreds of...
913000	915000	different simulations.
915000	917000	Before I talk about...
917000	919000	the common points of these simulations,
919000	921000	we can think about...
921000	923000	a simple question about sports.
923000	925000	For example, you start from...
925000	927000	your door today.
927000	929000	You walk 1 meter every second.
929000	931000	Where will you be after 10 seconds?
931000	933000	The answer is...
933000	935000	you will be 10 meters away from your home.
935000	937000	This is a very simple question...
937000	939000	about sports.
939000	941000	Most students in high school...
941000	943000	are familiar with...
943000	945000	complex sports questions.
945000	947000	For example, acceleration...
947000	949000	and force.
949000	951000	These questions are basically...
951000	953000	as long as we know the starting speed...
953000	955000	and starting position of an object...
955000	957000	and we consider the force...
957000	959000	and acceleration...
959000	961000	we can estimate...
961000	963000	where the object will appear...
963000	965000	at a certain point in time.
965000	967000	In a complex system,
967000	969000	we can even know...
969000	971000	the position, speed...
971000	973000	and acceleration of the object...
973000	975000	at any point in time...
975000	977000	or even the energy.
977000	979000	Basically,
979000	981000	this is what molecular dynamics...
981000	983000	is doing.
983000	985000	In simple terms,
985000	987000	molecular dynamics...
987000	989000	is an effective way...
989000	991000	to solve...
991000	993000	a series of...
993000	995000	Newton's second law...
995000	997000	and the Hamiltonian.
997000	999000	How is molecular dynamics...
999000	1001000	actually done?
1001000	1003000	In a molecular dynamics simulation...
1003000	1005000	we have a simulation box.
1005000	1007000	In this simulation box...
1007000	1009000	we put in all the...
1009000	1011000	atoms and molecules we want to simulate.
1011000	1013000	For example,
1013000	1015000	if I want to simulate...
1015000	1017000	a permutation of a number...
1017000	1019000	I put the permutation of a number...
1019000	1021000	into the simulation box.
1021000	1023000	I want to simulate...
1023000	1025000	a water-soluble...
1025000	1027000	water-soluble...
1027000	1029000	water-soluble...
1029000	1031000	water-soluble...
1031000	1033000	water-soluble.
1033000	1035000	If I want to keep...
1035000	1037000	the system neutral...
1037000	1039000	I add some...
1039000	1041000	oxygen or nitrogen...
1041000	1043000	to keep the system neutral.
1043000	1045000	Basically,
1045000	1047000	in the...
1047000	1049000	simulation box...
1049000	1051000	for each atom...
1051000	1053000	for each atom and molecule...
1053000	1055000	we have the initial speed...
1055000	1057000	speed, position...
1057000	1059000	and energy...
1059000	1061000	and so on.
1061000	1063000	Through these initial conditions...
1063000	1065000	initial conditions...
1065000	1067000	or initial conditions...
1067000	1069000	if you've studied the equation...
1069000	1071000	it's actually initial conditions.
1071000	1073000	With these initial conditions...
1073000	1075000	we can calculate...
1075000	1077000	all the atoms...
1077000	1079000	at a certain point in the future...
1079000	1081000	the position...
1081000	1083000	the speed...
1083000	1085000	the energy...
1085000	1087000	and so on.
1087000	1089000	In a molecular dynamic simulation...
1089000	1091000	we can know...
1091000	1093000	in the simulation box...
1093000	1095000	how each object...
1095000	1097000	moves...
1097000	1099000	or even...
1099000	1101000	in our case...
1101000	1103000	how the inner structure...
1103000	1105000	is close or far from each other.
1105000	1107000	The animation you see now...
1107000	1109000	you can see different parts...
1109000	1111000	moving around.
1111000	1113000	Basically,
1113000	1115000	molecular dynamic simulation...
1115000	1117000	allows us to see...
1117000	1119000	how an atom...
1119000	1121000	or an atom and an atom...
1121000	1123000	interact with each other.
1123000	1125000	With the method...
1125000	1127000	we can define...
1127000	1129000	the goal of our research.
1129000	1131000	Our method is...
1131000	1133000	molecular dynamic simulation.
1133000	1135000	Our goal is...
1135000	1137000	to build a simulation...
1137000	1139000	so we don't have to...
1139000	1141000	do chemical synthesis.
1141000	1143000	We can find...
1143000	1145000	the most likely...
1145000	1147000	high-resistance...
1147000	1149000	and low-resistance structure...
1149000	1151000	from a series of...
1151000	1153000	carboxylic acids.
1153000	1155000	This is our overall goal.
1155000	1157000	In order to build...
1157000	1159000	this simulation method...
1159000	1161000	we basically focus on...
1161000	1163000	the 12 elements...
1163000	1165000	of carboxylic acids...
1165000	1167000	studied by experimentalists.
1167000	1169000	In the simulation...
1169000	1171000	we first find...
1171000	1173000	5 elements of carboxylic acids.
1173000	1175000	Starting from these 5 elements...
1175000	1177000	each of them...
1177000	1179000	is like a template.
1179000	1181000	Each template...
1181000	1183000	can be used to generate...
1183000	1185000	12 carboxylic acids.
1185000	1187000	There are 65 elements...
1187000	1189000	in the template.
1189000	1191000	Each of these 65 elements...
1191000	1193000	is a long enough...
1193000	1195000	molecular dynamic simulation.
1195000	1197000	The basic logic...
1197000	1199000	is that...
1199000	1201000	we run a carboxylic acid simulation...
1201000	1203000	followed by a carboxylic acid simulation.
1203000	1205000	We compare...
1205000	1207000	the trajectories...
1207000	1209000	or the physical properties...
1209000	1211000	to see if there are any differences.
1211000	1213000	We try to figure out...
1213000	1215000	what are the causes...
1215000	1217000	that lead to...
1217000	1219000	carboxylic acid resistance...
1219000	1221000	or carboxylic acid resistance.
1221000	1223000	We know that...
1223000	1225000	the entire process...
1225000	1227000	is...
1227000	1229000	just by looking at...
1229000	1231000	the carboxylic acid simulation...
1231000	1233000	we can't see anything.
1233000	1235000	Too many atoms and molecules...
1235000	1237000	are moving at the same time.
1237000	1239000	Many things...
1239000	1241000	have to be...
1241000	1243000	quantified in the simulation.
1243000	1245000	The workflow...
1245000	1247000	is to set up a hypothesis.
1247000	1249000	We can assume that...
1249000	1251000	a certain amount of carboxylic acid...
1251000	1253000	is...
1253000	1255000	able to affect...
1255000	1257000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1257000	1259000	or the carboxylic acid resistance.
1259000	1261000	Then we use the simulation...
1261000	1263000	to calculate the amount of carboxylic acid...
1263000	1265000	and compare it with the experiment.
1265000	1267000	If it matches the experiment...
1267000	1269000	it means that the hypothesis...
1269000	1271000	is plausible.
1271000	1273000	If it doesn't match...
1273000	1275000	it means that the hypothesis...
1275000	1277000	is not plausible.
1277000	1279000	In this research...
1279000	1281000	we set up many different hypotheses...
1281000	1283000	for two types of carboxylic acid resistance...
1283000	1285000	and carboxylic acid resistance.
1285000	1287000	There are many words here.
1287000	1289000	I won't explain them one by one...
1289000	1291000	because they will be mentioned later.
1291000	1293000	Let's take a look...
1293000	1295000	at the hypothesis.
1295000	1297000	First, we will focus on...
1297000	1299000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1299000	1301000	of the carboxylic acid.
1301000	1303000	Then we will look back...
1303000	1305000	at the togethering of carboxylic acid.
1305000	1307000	Then we will look at...
1307000	1309000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1309000	1311000	of the carboxylic acid.
1311000	1313000	And then we will...
1313000	1315000	talk about the interaction between...
1315000	1317000	carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid.
1317000	1319000	The interaction between...
1319000	1321000	carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...
1321000	1323000	is mainly...
1325000	1327000	The first step is...
1327000	1329000	I simplify it.
1329000	1331000	The mechanism is...
1331000	1333000	First, the carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...
1333000	1335000	will be combined.
1335000	1337000	After that, the carboxylic acid will cut...
1337000	1339000	some positions of the carboxylic acid.
1339000	1341000	Then cut the carboxylic acid into two halves...
1341000	1343000	or even three halves...
1343000	1345000	three parts, four parts, etc.
1345000	1347000	But basically, as long as the carboxylic acid is cut...
1347000	1349000	it will lose its function.
1349000	1351000	In all 51 amino acids of carboxylic acid...
1351000	1353000	five of them...
1353000	1355000	may be...
1355000	1357000	cut off by alpha-carbotripsin...
1357000	1359000	the carboxylic acid.
1359000	1361000	The two places...
1361000	1363000	that are most likely to be cut off...
1363000	1365000	are B25 and B26...
1365000	1367000	the two amino acids.
1367000	1369000	You can see here...
1369000	1371000	some of the rings...
1371000	1373000	are the structure of the carboxylic acid.
1373000	1375000	They will be cut off.
1375000	1377000	Where is the cut off?
1377000	1379000	For example,
1379000	1381000	for B25 carboxylic acid...
1381000	1383000	the cut off is between...
1383000	1385000	B25 and B26...
1385000	1387000	the part of the carboxylic acid.
1387000	1389000	For B26 carboxylic acid...
1389000	1391000	the cut off is between...
1391000	1393000	B26 and B27...
1393000	1395000	the part of the carboxylic acid.
1395000	1397000	Based on this understanding...
1397000	1399000	we know that...
1399000	1401000	the carboxylic acid...
1401000	1403000	needs to be cut off.
1403000	1405000	There is a necessary factor...
1405000	1407000	that is...
1407000	1409000	the carboxylic acid...
1409000	1411000	needs to be cut off...
1411000	1413000	in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.
1413000	1415000	The whole set of logic...
1415000	1417000	that we study...
1417000	1419000	is to see...
1419000	1421000	what is the necessary factor...
1421000	1423000	that needs to be cut off.
1423000	1425000	We need to see...
1425000	1427000	if there is a way...
1427000	1429000	to destroy the necessary factor.
1429000	1431000	In this case...
1431000	1433000	the necessary factor is...
1433000	1435000	that the carboxylic acid...
1435000	1437000	needs to be cut off...
1437000	1439000	in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.
1439000	1441000	The first assumption...
1441000	1443000	is that...
1443000	1445000	if the carboxylic acid is stored...
1445000	1447000	inside the carboxylic acid...
1447000	1449000	it won't be cut off.
1449000	1451000	This assumption means that...
1451000	1453000	the structure...
1453000	1455000	has a higher resistance to carboxylic acid.
1455000	1457000	This is a full assertion.
1457000	1459000	We assume that if a...
1459000	1461000	sugar is added to the carboxylic acid...
1461000	1463000	the cut-off sugar is...
1463000	1465000	guaranteed to be stored inside.
1465000	1467000	This is a possible...
1467000	1469000	and effective mechanism.
1469000	1471000	What do we need to do in this simulation?
1471000	1473000	How do we quantify this?
1473000	1475000	How do we quantify this?
1475000	1477000	How do we quantify this?
1477000	1479000	We measure something called SASA.
1479000	1481000	Solve an Accessible Surface Area.
1481000	1483000	Solve an Accessible Surface Area.
1483000	1485000	On paper, this means that...
1485000	1487000	the surface area...
1487000	1489000	of a carboxylic acid...
1489000	1491000	in the carboxylic acid environment.
1491000	1493000	This means that...
1493000	1495000	the larger the SASA...
1495000	1497000	the larger the surface area...
1497000	1499000	of the carboxylic acid.
1499000	1501000	We assume that...
1501000	1503000	the carboxylic acid...
1503000	1505000	is exposed outside.
1505000	1507000	If it's covered inside...
1507000	1509000	it may not even be exposed to water.
1509000	1511000	So our assumption today is...
1511000	1513000	if a carboxylic acid...
1513000	1515000	can lower the SASA...
1515000	1517000	of the carboxylic acid B25 and B26...
1517000	1519000	it is very likely...
1519000	1521000	that it can raise the resistance...
1521000	1523000	of the carboxylic acid...
1523000	1525000	to the carboxylic acid.
1525000	1527000	Let's take a look...
1527000	1529000	This diagram looks a bit complicated...
1529000	1531000	but basically...
1531000	1533000	B25 and B26...
1533000	1535000	are the SASA...
1535000	1537000	of two different positions.
1537000	1539000	The axis...
1539000	1541000	is the time it takes...
1541000	1543000	for the carboxylic acid...
1543000	1545000	to digest the carboxylic acid.
1545000	1547000	So...
1547000	1549000	the simplest way...
1549000	1551000	since there are many data points...
1551000	1553000	the simplest way...
1553000	1555000	is to look at the numbers 10 and 13...
1555000	1557000	the two carboxylic acids.
1557000	1559000	Numbers 10 and 13...
1559000	1561000	are the two carboxylic acids...
1561000	1563000	that have the highest resistance...
1563000	1565000	to the carboxylic acid...
1565000	1567000	in the experiment.
1567000	1569000	We can see that...
1569000	1571000	these two carboxylic acids...
1571000	1573000	have a half-life...
1573000	1575000	longer than the other carboxylic acids.
1575000	1577000	This is the result of the experiment.
1577000	1579000	It shows that...
1579000	1581000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1581000	1583000	is higher in the experiment.
1583000	1585000	We can also see that...
1585000	1587000	these two carboxylic acids...
1587000	1589000	especially number 13...
1589000	1591000	have the lowest SASA value.
1591000	1593000	This means that...
1593000	1595000	when the SASA value is low...
1595000	1597000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1597000	1599000	can be improved.
1599000	1601000	Although...
1601000	1603000	number 10 and 13...
1603000	1605000	seem to be consistent...
1605000	1607000	with the experiment results...
1607000	1609000	there are many exceptions.
1609000	1611000	For example, in the square on the right...
1611000	1613000	we can see that...
1613000	1615000	the half-life of the carboxylic acid...
1615000	1617000	is relatively low.
1617000	1619000	This means that...
1619000	1621000	the carboxylic acid resistance...
1621000	1623000	is relatively low.
1623000	1625000	However, the SASA value...
1625000	1627000	is actually in the middle.
1627000	1629000	This is contrary...
1629000	1631000	to the experiment results.
1631000	1633000	So, from this...
1633000	1635000	measurement method...
1635000	1637000	we can only know that...
1637000	1639000	the SASA measurement method...
1639000	1641000	can only give us...
1641000	1643000	partial accurate prediction.
1643000	1645000	For those...
1645000	1647000	carboxylic acids...
1647000	1649000	with high SASA resistance...
1649000	1651000	their prediction may be accurate.
1651000	1653000	However, for those...
1653000	1655000	in the middle value...
1655000	1657000	their prediction ability...
1657000	1659000	is not so good.
1659000	1661000	Obviously, we have to...
1661000	1663000	find a better...
1663000	1665000	model...
1665000	1667000	to...
1667000	1669000	to model this phenomenon.
1669000	1671000	Basically, this model...
1671000	1673000	the first model...
1673000	1675000	is to look at...
1675000	1677000	the interface between...
1677000	1679000	the transfer function and the coefficient.
1679000	1681000	The second model...
1681000	1683000	is based on...
1683000	1685000	the 2-level structure of the transfer function.
1685000	1687000	First of all, the 2-level structure of the transfer function...
1687000	1689000	is related to...
1689000	1691000	the location of the carboxylic acid.
1691000	1693000	Let's look at...
1693000	1695000	this graph.
1695000	1697000	This circle represents...
1697000	1699000	the carboxylic acid...
1699000	1701000	which is B25 or B26.
1701000	1703000	The location of the carboxylic acid...
1703000	1705000	is C and P1'.
1705000	1707000	P1' is the carboxylic acid next to C.
1707000	1709000	It is...
1709000	1711000	the direction of the carbon.
1711000	1713000	The opposite direction is...
1713000	1715000	P1, P2 and P3.
1717000	1719000	In the past experiments...
1719000	1721000	we found that...
1721000	1723000	the area from P1 to P3...
1723000	1725000	is usually...
1725000	1727000	from the past experiments...
1727000	1729000	the area from P1 to P3...
1729000	1731000	is usually...
1731000	1733000	from the past experiments...
1733000	1735000	the area from P1 to P3...
1735000	1737000	is the omega3 structure...
1737000	1739000	in the combination with...
1739000	1741000	alpha-carbotrypsin.
1741000	1743000	This omega3 structure...
1745000	1747000	is a necessary factor...
1747000	1749000	required...
1749000	1751000	for therefore,
1751000	1753000	for example,
1753000	1755000	our target omega3...
1755000	1757000	oding is very important.
1757000	1759000	loss of atoms is between B25 and B26.
1761000	1763000	Which means...
1763000	1765000	from P1 to P3 are equal to...
1765000	1767000	if we take B25 as an example,
1767000	1769000	P1 is 24,
1769000	1771000	followed by 2 3 2 2,
1771000	1773000	for B26,
1773000	1775000	P1 P2 P3 are 23-25.
1775000	1777000	If we take both actions,
1777000	1779000	B25-B26,
1779000	1781000	we need to consider B22-B25,
1781000	1783000	P1-P3,
1783000	1785000	the 2-level structure.
1787000	1789000	Here,
1789000	1791000	our assumption is
1791000	1793000	if P1-P3
1793000	1795000	become
1795000	1797000	the lower the beta-shear tendency,
1797000	1799000	it will be able to
1799000	1801000	increase the antiparticle resistance.
1801000	1803000	Here,
1803000	1805000	I would like to remind you that
1805000	1807000	our logic is always the same.
1807000	1809000	When we assume
1809000	1811000	the beta-shear is
1811000	1813000	the necessary condition
1813000	1815000	for the antiparticle resistance,
1815000	1817000	we will try to break this condition.
1817000	1819000	Let's assume that
1819000	1821000	P1-P3
1821000	1823000	become the lower the beta-shear tendency,
1823000	1825000	it will be able to
1825000	1827000	avoid the antiparticle resistance.
1827000	1829000	In simulation,
1829000	1831000	how do we calculate
1831000	1833000	the beta-shear tendency
1833000	1835000	in this region?
1835000	1837000	Here is a graph called
1837000	1839000	Raman-Schrödinger plot.
1839000	1841000	I won't go into details here.
1841000	1843000	Basically,
1843000	1845000	it measures
1845000	1847000	each amino acid,
1847000	1849000	we are interested in amino acids,
1849000	1851000	B22-B25,
1851000	1853000	each amino acid,
1853000	1855000	and locate
1855000	1857000	the location of
1857000	1859000	each point
1859000	1861000	in the graph.
1861000	1863000	The more red points
1863000	1865000	appear in this region,
1865000	1867000	it means
1867000	1869000	the higher the antiparticle resistance
1869000	1871000	is.
1871000	1873000	We hope that
1873000	1875000	the lower the beta-shear tendency.
1875000	1877000	Let's see
1877000	1879000	the simulation data.
1879000	1881000	Here,
1881000	1883000	the graph looks
1883000	1885000	a bit complicated,
1885000	1887000	so I won't
1887000	1889000	go into details.
1889000	1891000	Basically,
1891000	1893000	here is the conclusion.
1893000	1895000	We found that
1895000	1897000	the beta-shear tendency
1897000	1899000	of P1 to P3
1899000	1901000	is not related to
1901000	1903000	the antiparticle resistance
1903000	1905000	of the guide tree.
1905000	1907000	Some of them
1907000	1909000	are not even related.
1909000	1911000	This means
1911000	1913000	that
1913000	1915000	our hypothesis
1915000	1917000	is wrong.
1917000	1919000	The reason is
1919000	1921000	that
1921000	1923000	if you are interested,
1923000	1925000	I can explain it later.
1925000	1927000	Basically,
1927000	1929000	the takeaway here
1929000	1931000	is that
1931000	1933000	the second hypothesis is still wrong.
1933000	1935000	Since the second hypothesis is still wrong,
1935000	1937000	we have to think about the third hypothesis.
1937000	1939000	Let me
1939000	1941000	help you review.
1941000	1943000	The first hypothesis
1943000	1945000	is based on
1945000	1947000	the difference between
1947000	1949000	the antiparticle resistance
1949000	1951000	of P1 to P3.
1951000	1953000	The second hypothesis
1953000	1955000	is based on
1955000	1957000	the second structure of the guide tree.
1957000	1959000	The third hypothesis
1959000	1961000	is based on
1961000	1963000	the interaction between
1963000	1965000	the guide tree
1965000	1967000	and the antiparticle resistance
1967000	1969000	of P1 to P3.
1969000	1971000	In the past,
1971000	1973000	we found that
1973000	1975000	alpha-chromotrypsin
1975000	1977000	interacts with
1977000	1979000	the protein
1979000	1981000	that can be cut
1981000	1983000	by alpha-chromotrypsin.
1983000	1985000	In this example,
1985000	1987000	we can see
1987000	1989000	that
1989000	1991000	the yellow circle
1991000	1993000	is the part of the guide tree.
1993000	1995000	The square below
1995000	1997000	is the amino acid
1997000	1999000	of alpha-chromotrypsin.
1999000	2001000	In the past,
2001000	2003000	we found that
2003000	2005000	alpha-chromotrypsin interacts
2005000	2007000	with the amino acid of
2007000	2009000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2009000	2011000	The interaction between
2011000	2013000	alpha-chromotrypsin and
2013000	2015000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2015000	2017000	is very common.
2017000	2019000	The four groups
2019000	2021000	are the standard
2021000	2023000	interactions
2023000	2025000	between the
2025000	2027000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2027000	2029000	and the
2029000	2031000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2031000	2033000	In this example,
2033000	2035000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2035000	2037000	interacts with
2037000	2039000	the amino acid of
2039000	2041000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2041000	2043000	The interaction between
2043000	2045000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2045000	2047000	and
2047000	2049000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2049000	2051000	is very common.
2051000	2053000	The interaction between
2053000	2055000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2055000	2057000	and
2057000	2059000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2059000	2061000	is very common.
2061000	2063000	In the case of
2063000	2065000	alpha-chromotrypsin,
2065000	2067000	the interaction
2067000	2069000	between
2069000	2071000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2071000	2073000	and
2073000	2075000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2075000	2077000	is very common.
2077000	2079000	We found that
2079000	2081000	the interaction between
2081000	2083000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2083000	2085000	and
2085000	2087000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2087000	2089000	is very common.
2089000	2091000	The biggest difference between
2091000	2093000	alpha-chromotrypsin and
2093000	2095000	alpha-chromotrypsin is that
2095000	2097000	alpha-chromotrypsin contains
2097000	2099000	a type of sugar,
2099000	2101000	whereas alpha-chromotrypsin
2101000	2103000	does not.
2103000	2105000	Let's assume that
2105000	2107000	the addition of
2107000	2109000	a type of sugar
2109000	2111000	can disrupt
2111000	2113000	the network of
2113000	2115000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2115000	2117000	In other words,
2117000	2119000	if alpha-chromotrypsin
2119000	2121000	prefers sugar
2121000	2123000	as a donor,
2123000	2125000	alpha-chromotrypsin will
2125000	2127000	interact with sugar
2127000	2129000	to create
2129000	2131000	a bond between
2131000	2133000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2133000	2135000	and
2135000	2137000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2137000	2139000	For example,
2139000	2141000	there are several couples
2141000	2143000	in front of you
2143000	2145000	and you want to
2145000	2147000	disrupt the bond between
2147000	2149000	them,
2149000	2151000	so you throw down
2151000	2153000	a type of sugar,
2153000	2155000	like alpha-chromotrypsin.
2155000	2157000	Alpha-chromotrypsin
2157000	2159000	and
2159000	2161000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2161000	2163000	form a new bond.
2163000	2165000	Let's assume that
2165000	2167000	sugar can disrupt
2167000	2169000	the network of
2169000	2171000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2171000	2173000	and alpha-chromotrypsin.
2173000	2175000	Let's see
2175000	2177000	if simulation
2177000	2179000	supports this assumption.
2179000	2181000	First,
2181000	2183000	we can see
2183000	2185000	the two structures
2185000	2187000	with the highest
2187000	2189000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2189000	2191000	We know that
2191000	2193000	10 and 13
2193000	2195000	have the highest
2195000	2197000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2197000	2199000	13 is the first one.
2199000	2201000	13,
2201000	2203000	we call it
2203000	2205000	the adsorption power
2205000	2207000	which can be
2207000	2209000	caused by
2209000	2211000	alpha-chromotrypsin
2211000	2213000	and
2213000	2215000	alpha-chromotrypsin.
2215000	2217000	13
2217000	2219000	has four
2219000	2221000	adsorption power
2221000	2223000	with
2223000	2225000	the highest
