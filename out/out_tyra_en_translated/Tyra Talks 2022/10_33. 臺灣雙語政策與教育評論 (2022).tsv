8000	12000	His topic is Taiwan bilingual policy and education review.
12000	17000	The speaker is a teacher with physical education, health education, and English teacher certificate.

29000	32000	how to find language learning experience,
32000	34000	long-term bilingual education experience,
34000	37000	and the participation and observation of Taiwan education and society in recent years.
37000	46000	It is the first time in the country that a bilingual policy and education review can have a deep understanding of macroeconomic analysis.
46000	51000	According to our TARA tradition, we will turn on the microphone to welcome the speaker.
51000	52000	Are you ready?
52000	56000	If you are ready, let's give him a round of applause.
61000	63000	Thank you.
63000	69000	Are these guests in Taiwan or in the US?
69000	74000	Can I know the background of the audience?
74000	76000	I am in the US.
77000	78000	Dr. Chen Tian-Yuan.
78000	80000	What about the others?
80000	88000	Can you turn on the microphone?
92000	96000	I don't know why you are here.
96000	98000	But I will start now.
99000	102000	I thought it was yesterday.
102000	108000	The time you sent me seems to be yesterday.
108000	112000	I didn't schedule anything yesterday.
112000	119000	So, I may not be here for a long time.
119000	122000	If I have a chance, I will share it with you.
128000	134000	I am a teacher in high school.
134000	137000	I am in the second year of Zheng University.
137000	145000	I am also a professor in the Center for Calculus in Zheng University.
145000	147000	I teach calculus.
147000	152000	As you can see in my resume,
152000	160000	I have worked with a lot of organizations.
160000	165000	Let's get back to my background.
165000	168000	I am a senior student.
168000	169000	I majored in PE.
169000	172000	But I like English.
172000	178000	I took the English exam in high school.
178000	182000	When I was in college, I wanted to major in English.
182000	184000	So, I took the English exam.
184000	186000	I don't need to take the exam now.
186000	188000	I just need to apply for the exam.
188000	193000	So, I got my license after graduation.
193000	198000	There are not many PE majors in China.
198000	200000	I also have an English license.
200000	208000	English helped me a lot.
208000	212000	So, I may share it later.
212000	219000	I hope to observe and comment on the state of Chinese in China.
219000	223000	But I still have some ideas.
223000	226000	This is related to my learning experience.
226000	228000	When I was learning English,
228000	231000	my English teacher had little influence on me.
231000	233000	We all learn by ourselves.
233000	237000	The point of self-study is that
237000	242000	the Ministry of Education has been talking about the direction of education.
242000	246000	I learn English not for the exam.
246000	255000	So, I started to apply English in my daily life in middle school.
255000	257000	So, this is how I do it.
257000	259000	When I went to school,
259000	264000	I would ask my classmates to try to interact with me in English.
264000	266000	At that time,
266000	269000	I was 46 years old.
269000	271000	When I was in my teens,
271000	274000	it was hard to take the college entrance exam.
274000	277000	It was not easy to take the exam at that time.
277000	280000	It was too late to prepare for the exam.
280000	288000	It was hard to speak English,
288000	290000	listen to English music,
290000	292000	and check the English list.
292000	294000	However, this kind of learning experience
294000	296000	was helpful for the exam.
296000	298000	So, it also influenced
298000	300000	my objective view of the current topic,
300000	306000	the policy of bilingualism.
306000	308000	Anyway,
308000	316000	I got the scholarship from the Ministry of Education.
316000	320000	Then, I chose the Human Movement Studies
320000	322000	at the University of Queensland, Australia
322000	324000	as my major to study
324000	328000	in the Department of Science and Regional Studies.
328000	330000	At that time,
330000	333000	my research was focused on...
333000	335000	As I was studying in the Department of Science and Regional Studies,
335000	337000	I got the scholarship from
337000	343000	Sports Coaching and Training.
343000	346000	It was focused on the direction of natural science.
346000	349000	That was the general trend in Taiwan.
349000	351000	However, when I went to Australia,
351000	353000	I followed my teachers.
353000	355000	They went to areas like
355000	357000	Sports Psychology, Sports Education,
357000	359000	Sports Society,
359000	363000	and the disciplinary area.
363000	365000	Therefore, my doctoral thesis
365000	369000	was focused on direct research.
369000	371000	I studied the topic
371000	373000	of a local organization
373000	377000	representing the Olympic Games.
377000	379000	The key word is
379000	383000	Workplace Learning.
383000	385000	Workplace Learning is an area
385000	387000	that I use.
387000	389000	I studied the professional talents
389000	391000	in the area
391000	393000	and how to develop professionally.
393000	395000	The Olympic team I chose
395000	397000	was actually
397000	399000	the Olympic diving team.
399000	401000	If you go to Australia in 2000,
401000	403000	you can get a gold medal
403000	405000	for diving in a row.
405000	407000	If you have a certain understanding
407000	409000	of sports,
409000	411000	you know that diving is usually
411000	413000	dominated by China.
413000	415000	Why did Australia get a gold medal
415000	417000	for diving in a row?
417000	419000	Because they hired
419000	421000	foreign coaches.
421000	423000	Especially,
423000	425000	Chinese elite coaches.
425000	427000	Therefore, my research topic
427000	429000	was to study how these people
429000	431000	learn and develop
431000	433000	through cultural exchange.
433000	435000	Of course, the focus
435000	437000	was mainly on the coach himself.
437000	439000	For example, how did he get
439000	441000	his professional skills?
441000	443000	Of course, it has to do with his
443000	445000	professional experience or
445000	447000	where he has taught.
447000	449000	However, there is an important point
449000	451000	about their cross-cultural communication.
451000	453000	In other words,
453000	455000	their language,
455000	457000	because the requirements in Australia
457000	459000	are different from Taiwan.
459000	461000	Foreigners go there
461000	463000	to learn
463000	465000	in their official language.
465000	467000	For example, in Taiwan,
467000	469000	if you know,
469000	471000	like Howard,
471000	473000	but we still send
473000	475000	translators for him.
475000	477000	This is the difference in nationality.
477000	479000	However, in Australia,
479000	481000	no matter where you work,
481000	483000	even if you are a chef,
483000	485000	or a professional,
485000	487000	you have to use
487000	489000	their official language to communicate.
489000	491000	Therefore, this is a challenge
491000	493000	for foreign coaches,
493000	495000	especially for non-English-speaking countries.
495000	497000	Therefore, my research topic
497000	499000	was to ask them how they learned
499000	501000	their language.
501000	503000	In this process,
503000	505000	I integrated my own
505000	507000	master's training,
507000	509000	personal interest in long-term English,
509000	511000	and the training
511000	513000	in my research.
513000	515000	Therefore,
515000	517000	I have this part
517000	519000	of my language policy.
519000	521000	The most important thing is that
521000	523000	in fact, in the country of 2030,
523000	525000	or the policy of 2030,
525000	527000	before it started in 2017,
527000	529000	I had been teaching
529000	531000	for more than 15 years.
531000	533000	In 2000,
533000	535000	when I was working
535000	537000	in a school,
537000	539000	or when I was
539000	541000	a teacher,
541000	543000	I was actually
543000	545000	trying to teach
545000	547000	all-English or
547000	549000	sign language sports.
549000	551000	Therefore,
551000	553000	I have 15 years of experience in this area.
553000	555000	Because of this situation,
555000	557000	I have become
557000	559000	a problem for many
559000	561000	domestic
561000	563000	frontline workers,
563000	565000	teaching staff,
565000	567000	or those who
567000	569000	criticize
569000	571000	the policy.
571000	573000	I have no problem with
573000	575000	this.
575000	577000	However,
577000	579000	in theory,
579000	581000	I may not be able to
581000	583000	implement the framework
583000	585000	of English.
585000	587000	Therefore,
587000	589000	I have to learn
589000	591000	not only from
591000	593000	the experience of
593000	595000	ethics,
595000	597000	but also from
597000	599000	the experience of
599000	601000	science.
601000	603000	Therefore,
603000	605000	in addition to my
605000	607000	major,
607000	609000	I have been
609000	611000	teaching
611000	613000	for more than
613000	615000	15 years.
615000	617000	This is also
617000	619000	a major
619000	621000	interest of mine.
621000	623000	This is also
623000	625000	a major
625000	627000	interest of mine.
627000	629000	This is also
629000	631000	a major
631000	633000	interest of mine.
633000	635000	In addition to
635000	637000	studying in Australia,
637000	639000	I went to
639000	641000	the United States.
641000	643000	Before I went to
643000	645000	the United States,
645000	647000	although the English
647000	649000	I learned in Taiwan
649000	651000	was not typical,
651000	653000	I still found
653000	655000	some differences.
655000	657000	For example,
657000	659000	their everyday English
659000	661000	was different from
661000	663000	our training.
663000	665000	This made me
665000	667000	think about
667000	669000	what I should do
669000	671000	to improve my English.
671000	673000	For example,
673000	675000	when I traveled to
675000	677000	Europe,
677000	679000	I went to
679000	681000	the International
681000	683000	Olympic Youth Conference
683000	685000	in Greece.
685000	687000	I noticed that
687000	689000	the official language
689000	691000	was English.
691000	693000	I noticed that
693000	695000	the official language
695000	697000	was English.
697000	699000	We're the
699000	701000	scholars of Taiwan,
701000	703000	Japan, and Korea.
703000	705000	We're all based in LGBTQI community.
705000	707000	But I was the
707000	709000	moderator of
709000	711000	the Japanese and Korean
711000	713000	oral posters yesterday,
713000	715000	which means I am the host of them.
715000	717000	But I was the moderator of
717000	719000	the Japanese and Korean
719000	721000	oral posters yesterday,
721000	723000	which means I am the host of them.
723000	725000	I have a good feeling about the details
725000	727000	of the post.
727000	729000	I have a solution, of course.
729000	731000	So, today I'm going to
731000	733000	talk about a few
733000	735000	key issues.
735000	737000	And how far
737000	739000	the research has gone.
739000	741000	Let's see if we can interact.
741000	743000	This chart
743000	745000	shows
745000	747000	my language learning.
747000	749000	I'm learning
749000	751000	PopFish,
751000	753000	and I'm using
753000	755000	language in my daily life.
755000	757000	I'm using language in my daily life.
757000	759000	That's about it.
759000	761000	That's about it.
761000	763000	That's about it.
763000	765000	As I mentioned earlier,
765000	767000	As I mentioned earlier,

785000	787000	I have many other articles.

918000	920000	Chinese
920000	922000	Chinese
922000	924000	In my opinion
924000	926000	Shuang Yu should
926000	928000	go further
928000	930000	rather than
930000	932000	looking for
932000	934000	so-called
934000	936000	non-exams
936000	938000	subjects
938000	940000	like sports, art, music
940000	942000	and so on
942000	944000	He is still learning
944000	946000	Chinese math
946000	948000	calculus
948000	950000	biology
950000	952000	and so on
952000	954000	When it comes to sports
954000	956000	he suddenly changes to bilingual mode
956000	958000	This is a
958000	960000	very interesting question
960000	962000	If you look at it
962000	964000	from many perspectives
966000	968000	In Taiwan
968000	970000	Shuang Yu
972000	974000	has a...
974000	976000	Let's take a look at this chart
976000	978000	Why is there so much discussion
978000	980000	in Taiwan
980000	982000	so far?
982000	984000	There are basically three reasons
986000	988000	Three perspectives
988000	990000	The first one is
990000	992000	a mess
994000	996000	To be honest
996000	998000	Shuang Yu is obviously
998000	1000000	going to drop out of school
1000000	1002000	Taipei City
1002000	1004000	will announce 100%
1004000	1006000	Shuang Yu will drop out of
1006000	1008000	high school
1008000	1010000	In fact, they are also
1010000	1012000	moving in this direction
1012000	1014000	All schools in Taiwan
1014000	1016000	have been
1016000	1018000	looking for
1018000	1020000	Shuang Yu program
1020000	1022000	Shuang Yu teaching
1022000	1024000	or Shuang Yu class
1024000	1026000	including high-level EMI
1026000	1028000	So if you happen to be
1028000	1030000	in the United States
1030000	1032000	studying
1032000	1034000	In fact, before 2013
1034000	1036000	you were relatively smart
1036000	1038000	Because you
1038000	1040000	People believe you can
1040000	1042000	EMI
1042000	1044000	That is, you can teach in full English
1044000	1046000	But we
1046000	1048000	are from the same city
1048000	1050000	But more teachers
1050000	1052000	educate
1052000	1054000	and learn
1054000	1056000	acquire their teaching experience
1056000	1058000	locally in Taiwan
1058000	1060000	So their Shuang Yu policy
1060000	1062000	There is no way
1062000	1064000	So in this situation
1064000	1066000	what I said
1066000	1068000	Three kinds
1068000	1070000	One is a teacher
1070000	1072000	will say this policy
1072000	1074000	Just kidding
1074000	1076000	Opposed
1076000	1078000	The second is like us
1078000	1080000	Because we think about its benefits
1082000	1084000	You get a lot of benefits
1084000	1086000	of these people
1086000	1088000	Or you have seen
1088000	1090000	That is,
1090000	1092000	English can really
1092000	1094000	lead us
1094000	1096000	At least we can
1096000	1098000	quickly push ourselves
1098000	1100000	or learn foreign things
1100000	1102000	This is what we think is good
1102000	1104000	So YES
1104000	1106000	In the middle, he did not understand
1106000	1108000	He just like Wu Bing
1108000	1110000	will drift
1110000	1112000	In this case, you will find
1112000	1114000	that all policies are the same
1114000	1116000	He just voted
1116000	1118000	I just finished voting last week
1118000	1120000	YES, I vote for you
1120000	1122000	Or NO, I vote for you
1122000	1124000	All the same
1124000	1126000	So I may
1126000	1128000	talk about this first
1128000	1130000	The first question
1130000	1132000	In the end, Shuang Yu country
1134000	1136000	What are you doing
1136000	1138000	Shuang Yu policy
1138000	1140000	This
1140000	1142000	He is not in 2017
1142000	1144000	He is in 2000
1144000	1146000	He is a think tank
1146000	1148000	in Hainan
1148000	1150000	You go to read that
1150000	1152000	Taiwan's English policy
1152000	1154000	In addition to our traditional understanding
1154000	1156000	English teaching
1156000	1158000	Taiwan's English teaching
1158000	1160000	I think it is quite successful
1160000	1162000	It should be said that the so-called success is
1162000	1164000	We
1164000	1166000	Our
1166000	1168000	English is at least better than Japan and Korea
1168000	1170000	At least better than Japan
1170000	1172000	I don't know why
1172000	1174000	Maybe because
1174000	1176000	Our relationship with the United States
1176000	1178000	Or
1178000	1180000	Taiwanese
1180000	1182000	Watch a lot of HBO
1182000	1184000	Japanese should watch
1184000	1186000	But
1186000	1188000	This is learning English
1188000	1190000	English
1190000	1192000	But now you have to be comprehensive
1192000	1194000	To many subjects
1194000	1196000	Even industrial
1196000	1198000	There are some banks in Taiwan
1198000	1200000	They are now holding Shuang Yu demonstration area
1200000	1202000	The question is
1202000	1204000	Why do we have Shuang Yu
1204000	1206000	Is Shuang Yu class in English class?
1206000	1208000	What if the teacher
1208000	1210000	I can't teach Chinese
1210000	1212000	What to do
1212000	1214000	There are some teachers who want to do Shuang Yu
1214000	1216000	Some are like us
1216000	1218000	I think
1218000	1220000	Where is the beef
1220000	1222000	Is there any place
1222000	1224000	This is all
1224000	1226000	A very interesting
1226000	1228000	So this question
1228000	1230000	Everyone is like this
1230000	1232000	Everyone has an answer
1232000	1234000	Different answers
1234000	1236000	But back to a
1236000	1238000	Level of tool value
1242000	1244000	The answer may be this
1244000	1246000	Just for
1246000	1248000	Take it as a
1250000	1252000	Weapon
1252000	1254000	It is a tool
1254000	1256000	It is a tool for communication
1256000	1258000	It is a
1258000	1260000	Our National Development and Reform Commission
1260000	1262000	And so on
1262000	1264000	Claimed
1264000	1266000	Can let us sell to the world
1266000	1268000	Especially the English class world
1268000	1270000	Because they are still in the world
1270000	1272000	Leading
1272000	1274000	Whether in technology
1274000	1276000	Or
1276000	1278000	Leading on many systems
1278000	1280000	The so-called lead is
1280000	1282000	That is
1282000	1284000	They are stronger
1284000	1286000	To be honest
1286000	1288000	It's all relative
1288000	1290000	Then we can follow these
1290000	1292000	Powerful people
1292000	1294000	They can understand us faster
1294000	1296000	it is good
1296000	1298000	This situation
1298000	1300000	Why 2030 Shuang Yu
1300000	1302000	Shuang Yu
1302000	1304000	policy
1304000	1306000	of course
1306000	1308000	This question
1308000	1310000	country
1310000	1312000	No special
1312000	1314000	You may have a bottom in your heart
1314000	1316000	I just talked about two thousand years
1316000	1318000	Tainan Gang
1318000	1320000	Think of this strategy
1320000	1322000	Then you
1322000	1324000	Since Tainan Gang
1324000	1326000	You will think of some color problems
1326000	1328000	That
1328000	1330000	in fact
1330000	1332000	It is very clear that
1332000	1334000	He is actually
1334000	1336000	a
1336000	1338000	Going to America
1338000	1340000	Strategic policy
1340000	1342000	That is to say
1342000	1344000	No matter how much you talk about
1346000	1348000	But now
1348000	1350000	Two months ago
1350000	1352000	We all know that Pelosi flew to Taiwan
1352000	1354000	Then why not
1354000	1356000	Li Keqiang is in Taiwan
1356000	1358000	My question is like this
1358000	1360000	It means that Shuang Yu
1360000	1362000	Policy is actually in
1362000	1364000	language
1364000	1366000	Do you say
1366000	1368000	Weakened Chinese
1368000	1370000	Someone proposed
1370000	1372000	Didn't we all say that Guo Wenke
1372000	1374000	Zhou Wenke is even a university teacher
1374000	1376000	Shuang Yu
1376000	1378000	Of course he also has his thoughts
1378000	1380000	But why did he let people
1380000	1382000	Study English
1382000	1384000	That is obviously
1384000	1386000	Have his
1386000	1388000	The consideration of our partnership
1388000	1390000	Just like our New Southbound
1390000	1392000	He doesn't want to
1392000	1394000	Put all the eggs on the shore
1394000	1396000	He wants
1396000	1398000	How kind
1398000	1400000	Especially to report the correct answer
1400000	1402000	So this is what you see
1402000	1404000	This situation
1404000	1406000	So this situation is
1408000	1410000	We want to say
1410000	1412000	So you have to understand
1412000	1414000	In the end
1414000	1416000	This policy
1416000	1418000	What are those people thinking
1418000	1420000	what
1420000	1422000	and so
1422000	1424000	This is also
1424000	1426000	Then you think about it
1426000	1428000	Then I want Shuang Yu today
1428000	1430000	What do I think about it
1430000	1432000	Why is the environment so noisy
1432000	1434000	You may have
1434000	1436000	Think about it slowly
1436000	1438000	I think this is
1438000	1440000	This is a low part
1440000	1442000	Then I personally feel
1442000	1444000	Shuang Yu
1444000	1446000	For Taiwan
1446000	1448000	The reflection of the education system is very good
1448000	1450000	because
1450000	1452000	He
1452000	1454000	We are talking about cross-fields now
1454000	1456000	That is actually
1458000	1460000	English
1462000	1464000	Non-English class
1464000	1466000	He is actually helping to some extent
1466000	1468000	English class
1468000	1470000	What is English class doing
1470000	1472000	Our English class is actually
1472000	1474000	Many are in
1474000	1476000	Preparing for the exam
1478000	1480000	Early reading and writing
1480000	1482000	Writing words
1482000	1484000	Understand grammar
1484000	1486000	Write some short texts
1486000	1488000	In the past ten years
1488000	1490000	Twenty years
1490000	1492000	The country began to test
1492000	1494000	Listen
1494000	1496000	But he still didn't get the number
1496000	1498000	So it becomes our students
1498000	1500000	Used to learn English
1500000	1502000	So when it comes to real foreigners
1502000	1504000	I can't speak a word
1504000	1506000	So I think Shuang Yu
1506000	1508000	At this time
1508000	1510000	Not only expand his
1510000	1512000	English learning
1512000	1514000	In addition to imagination
1514000	1516000	He is also
1516000	1518000	Will return to one
1518000	1520000	If you put it
1520000	1522000	Think clearly about this matter
1522000	1524000	You will find out
1524000	1526000	Teacher
1526000	1528000	Can use the right words
1528000	1530000	To solve the problem of our long-term education
1530000	1532000	Is to focus on the exam
1532000	1534000	Instead of application
1534000	1536000	Of course the exam is also an application
1536000	1538000	But that is to say
1538000	1540000	The exam is expected
1540000	1542000	That may be three years later
1542000	1544000	That time
1544000	1546000	Or the usual period
1546000	1548000	But I'm talking about the applicability
1548000	1550000	The breadth and depth is
1550000	1552000	You may
1552000	1554000	In this situation
1554000	1556000	You may think in
1556000	1558000	Ordinary
1558000	1560000	For long-term application
1560000	1562000	Then international
1562000	1564000	I think this is a
1564000	1566000	Shuang Yu to
1566000	1568000	An opportunity point
1568000	1570000	This is probably the case
1574000	1576000	This question is a bit
1576000	1578000	Professional Shuang Yu
1578000	1580000	Teaching
1580000	1582000	So probably
1582000	1584000	Needless to say
1588000	1590000	Take a look
1590000	1592000	I should have a question
1594000	1596000	Let me see
1596000	1598000	I think it's still simple here
1598000	1600000	Just say ok
1600000	1602000	If Shuang Yu
1602000	1604000	Today
1604000	1606000	In
1606000	1608000	Our purpose
1608000	1610000	Everyone has a certain idea
1610000	1612000	Then maybe a speech
1612000	1614000	Can be done
1614000	1616000	Then you will meet one
1616000	1618000	When Shuang Yu goes to class
1618000	1620000	In fact, if you
1620000	1622000	I'm going to college
1622000	1624000	How to teach
1624000	1626000	In fact, it is called ENI
1626000	1628000	Written here
1628000	1630000	But now
1630000	1632000	For example, you
1632000	1634000	You have to put your subject in full English
1634000	1636000	In fact
1636000	1638000	This is also the case in the international market
1638000	1640000	Many international schools
1640000	1642000	I'm not talking about universities
1642000	1644000	Research Institute
1644000	1646000	International
1646000	1648000	When everyone is looking for a job
1648000	1650000	ENI
1650000	1652000	Then go to ENI
1652000	1654000	That's all
1654000	1656000	No competitiveness
1656000	1658000	Of course, under middle school
1658000	1660000	That is to say, he may have a lot of teaching
1660000	1662000	Strategy
1662000	1664000	Then use some of his subject
1664000	1666000	Theoretical framework
1666000	1668000	Then go to Shuang Yu teaching
1668000	1670000	This part of the domestic people are less talking
1670000	1672000	It's just me
1672000	1674000	I can think of this thing
1674000	1676000	Of course, because I have a book
1676000	1678000	So probably this situation
1678000	1680000	I speak faster
1680000	1682000	Shuang Yu teaching
1682000	1684000	In fact, in the end
1684000	1686000	How does he say
1686000	1688000	He didn't say you think
1688000	1690000	It's important that you do it
1690000	1692000	but
1692000	1694000	He wants to go back to a learning site
1694000	1696000	Because we all know that students actually
1698000	1700000	The gap is very large
1700000	1702000	So there are people using that screen gap
1702000	1704000	He will expand
1704000	1706000	Weakness
1706000	1708000	With that kind
1708000	1710000	Their imagination is English
1710000	1712000	Home is better
1712000	1714000	So this one
1714000	1716000	Cultural language
1716000	1718000	What capital is pulling more
1718000	1720000	So when the teacher was on
1720000	1722000	There is also a
1722000	1724000	Maybe he studied English
1724000	1726000	So he decided to read science
1726000	1728000	Still have to read English
1728000	1730000	Now Shuang Yu
1730000	1732000	Simply put, it's actually Shuang Yu
1732000	1734000	He will meet one later
1734000	1736000	Whether you are well prepared
1736000	1738000	Can students accept
1738000	1740000	Always a problem
1740000	1742000	So he is a teacher
1742000	1744000	A two-way interaction
1744000	1746000	So you teach any class
1746000	1748000	You teach any client without Shuang Yu
1748000	1750000	Also encountered this problem
1750000	1752000	So it becomes
1752000	1754000	The reflection inside is very important
1754000	1756000	The teacher's sensitivity
1756000	1758000	Because the teacher has power
1758000	1760000	Of course now students
1760000	1762000	They start to have a say
1762000	1764000	They will criticize you
1764000	1766000	So this becomes
1766000	1768000	This duality becomes important
1768000	1770000	But another level of Shuang Yu
1770000	1772000	I also mentioned here
1772000	1774000	It is also less mentioned in China
1774000	1776000	Must consider language and culture
1776000	1778000	Duality and equality
1778000	1780000	it is good
1780000	1782000	Because many of us
1782000	1784000	You can show English
1784000	1786000	Very awesome
1786000	1788000	But this is a bit like
1788000	1790000	It's a bit like saying
1790000	1792000	Self-respect
1792000	1794000	Self-respect
1794000	1796000	I think this mentality is very bad
1796000	1798000	A better mentality should be
1798000	1800000	Equal to each other
1800000	1802000	For example, when we are today
1802000	1804000	When Shuang Yu was teaching
1804000	1806000	Uh
1806000	1808000	You see a lot of English teachers
1808000	1810000	When a lot of Shuang Yu teachers are in class
1810000	1812000	His blackboard is full of English
1812000	1814000	Then he speaks a lot of English
1814000	1816000	Then he tried to teach
1816000	1818000	Well, that's fine
1818000	1820000	If you can absorb
1820000	1822000	I will expand your experience
1822000	1824000	But I think Shuang Yu
1824000	1826000	Another level is
1826000	1828000	You should put your own good things
1828000	1830000	Use the language that the other person understands
1830000	1832000	Teach him
1832000	1834000	Just this is called English
1834000	1836000	So for example, when I go to
1836000	1838000	Sports class
1838000	1840000	In addition to going abroad
1840000	1842000	Some sports
1842000	1844000	I will also work hard to teach students
1844000	1846000	Put your own good things
1846000	1848000	For example, martial arts
1848000	1850000	Martial arts
1850000	1852000	What do you know
1852000	1854000	Teach foreigners
1854000	1856000	For example, this time you use English
1856000	1858000	You don't have to learn from others
1858000	1860000	But you have to put your own good things
1860000	1862000	Teach others
1862000	1864000	Even if we are in the United States
1864000	1866000	When I was studying in New York
1866000	1868000	When I was studying in Australia
1868000	1870000	We want to cook a Taiwanese dish for each other
1870000	1872000	That concept
1872000	1874000	You know our good
1874000	1876000	Then
1876000	1878000	You teach your good
1878000	1880000	Hamburger for me
1880000	1882000	I introduce my delicious
1882000	1884000	I'll give you a pancake
1884000	1886000	This is mutual
1886000	1888000	So language design
1888000	1890000	Shuang Yu course design
1890000	1892000	I will consider this
1892000	1894000	Won't go over
1894000	1896000	But they have to come over
1896000	1898000	I think this part is quite important
1898000	1900000	I also think this is
1900000	1902000	If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is pushing the Shuang Yu course
1902000	1904000	There must be something local
1904000	1906000	International
1906000	1908000	Local
1908000	1910000	This thinking
1910000	1912000	Ok now back to me
1912000	1914000	Maybe
1914000	1916000	Maybe these
1916000	1918000	Maybe with us
1918000	1920000	This
1920000	1922000	Because we all have the right
1922000	1924000	What is the current level of domestic and foreign Shuang Yu research
1924000	1926000	If you
1926000	1928000	Some of you who come to listen today
1928000	1930000	I think this is
1930000	1932000	Probably the same
1932000	1934000	That is to say, this is a very good graduation topic
1934000	1936000	Because in addition to the journal
1936000	1938000	There has always been a need
1938000	1940000	There are idols
1940000	1942000	P1
1942000	1944000	There is a need for this kind of journal
1944000	1946000	There are people who make people confused
1946000	1948000	We will use different methods
1948000	1950000	We will find different problems
1950000	1952000	Then use different methods to solve it
1952000	1954000	Because it always has
1954000	1956000	A mysterious color
1956000	1958000	People will be together because
1958000	1960000	I don't understand
1960000	1962000	Ha ha
1962000	1964000	It's like this at the moment
1964000	1966000	Shuang Yu
1966000	1968000	Research in China
1968000	1970000	at present
1970000	1972000	There is
1972000	1974000	Continuous output
1974000	1976000	That foreign trend
1976000	1978000	Foreign trend
1978000	1980000	Especially in the field of language
1980000	1982000	There are also many
1982000	1984000	Then I have
1984000	1986000	If you look at this field
1986000	1988000	I think there is a very interesting place
1988000	1990000	I will introduce one here
1990000	1992000	Such a piece
1992000	1994000	This one is about Spain
1994000	1996000	One of their case studies
1996000	1998000	White Linguist
1998000	2000000	I think this one is more interesting
2000000	2002000	Because he
2002000	2004000	Just like all research
2004000	2006000	In one
2006000	2008000	This kind
2008000	2010000	Direction
2010000	2012000	Will produce a lot
2012000	2014000	Sometimes the opposite
2014000	2016000	found
2016000	2018000	Basically he is talking about this one
2018000	2020000	Will Shuang Yu
2020000	2022000	Affect the amount of physical activity
2022000	2024000	This research question
2024000	2026000	Ask this
2026000	2028000	That
2028000	2030000	In fact, the amount of physical activity
2030000	2032000	Is the imagination of everyone in the gym
2032000	2034000	I want you to come to the gym today
2034000	2036000	I usually hope you have
2036000	2038000	Exercise
2038000	2040000	Don't say what kind of technology
2040000	2042000	You just
2042000	2044000	Heart rate increase
2044000	2046000	To run a few thousand steps
2046000	2048000	Sweating
2048000	2050000	Then I think you have reached
2050000	2052000	Certain requirements of the gym
2052000	2054000	So his thinking is
2054000	2056000	If I come in today
2056000	2058000	Will it cause this
2058000	2060000	Positive or negative
2060000	2062000	What is their relationship
2062000	2064000	Ask this
2064000	2066000	But this question
2066000	2068000	In fact, you use another department to ask
2068000	2070000	For example, I brought you in today
2070000	2072000	Mathematical ability
2072000	2074000	Does it affect the teaching section?
2074000	2076000	Wait a minute
2076000	2078000	Will it cause good or bad
2078000	2080000	He asked you
2080000	2082000	So you can see from this one
2082000	2084000	He is
2084000	2086000	Selected
2086000	2088000	Some key words
2088000	2090000	Then he hopes
2090000	2092000	Students can achieve moderate
2092000	2094000	Vigorous physical activity
2094000	2096000	Medium strength
2096000	2098000	Moderate
2098000	2100000	A little tired
2100000	2102000	Physical activity
2102000	2104000	Then he defined it as
2104000	2106000	MVPA
2106000	2108000	The teaching mode he uses is
2108000	2110000	CLEAR
2110000	2112000	Compton Language Integrated Learning
2112000	2114000	The so-called bilingual teaching mode
2114000	2116000	Very popular in Europe
2116000	2118000	Then he went to intervene
2118000	2120000	So one of the groups is
2120000	2122000	CLEAR mode
2122000	2124000	Experimental group
2124000	2126000	Experimental group is normal teaching
2126000	2128000	The thinking is like this
2128000	2130000	Then go
2130000	2132000	Quantified to start doing
2132000	2134000	How does he do it
2134000	2136000	He just let the students
2136000	2138000	Put that
2138000	2140000	Maybe a calculator or something
2140000	2142000	He talked about that thing
2142000	2144000	Measure his activity
2144000	2146000	Then test
2146000	2148000	A few weeks
2148000	2150000	Of course you
2150000	2152000	There is a fact of teaching
2152000	2154000	So he knows
2154000	2156000	He wants to invite
2156000	2158000	One of the participants is
2158000	2160000	CLEAR teacher
2160000	2162000	Come to teach
2162000	2164000	That
2164000	2166000	Before the result
2166000	2168000	I thought they had another group
2168000	2170000	Research
2170000	2172000	They found it would affect
2172000	2174000	The so-called
2174000	2176000	Obstruction
2176000	2178000	Reduce students' physical activity
2178000	2180000	There was another team before
2180000	2182000	It's like this
2182000	2184000	Because the amount of language is too much
2184000	2186000	Leading to a decrease in student exercise time
2186000	2188000	Is this side
2188000	2190000	Hit him
2190000	2192000	Hit him here
2192000	2194000	No
2194000	2196000	Look at this
2196000	2198000	% of time per session spent on
2198000	2200000	MVPA
2200000	2202000	Use CLEAR
2202000	2204000	Do you see the average value?
2204000	2206000	GENERAL
2206000	2208000	35.15B
2208000	2210000	The control group of CLEAR
2210000	2212000	Obviously high
2212000	2214000	OK
2216000	2218000	Probably
2218000	2220000	A lot higher
2220000	2222000	Boys and girls have
2222000	2224000	His instrument
2224000	2226000	The amount is shown
2226000	2228000	Very simple research
2228000	2230000	Then he will explain now
2230000	2232000	This result
2232000	2234000	Why is that so?
2234000	2236000	The previous explanation said because the teacher
2236000	2238000	Too much nonsense
2238000	2240000	Language orientation
2240000	2242000	OK
2242000	2244000	Let me tell you
2246000	2248000	Because he used something
2248000	2250000	This table
2250000	2252000	COMMUNICATIVE TEACHING STRATEGY
2256000	2258000	That is to say
2258000	2260000	What
2260000	2262000	The way the teacher uses
2262000	2264000	REFORCING THE MESSAGE
2264000	2266000	REFORCING THE MESSAGE
2266000	2268000	THROUGH THE COMPLEMENTARY NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
2268000	2270000	That is
2270000	2272000	We say
2272000	2274000	When the teacher teaches in Chinese
2276000	2278000	So I'll tell you
2278000	2280000	Use more
2280000	2282000	POSTURE, GESTURE
2282000	2284000	Or EYE CONTACT
2284000	2286000	You
2286000	2288000	Like this
2288000	2290000	NONVERBAL
2290000	2292000	You can say this
2292000	2294000	This is one
2294000	2296000	His strategy
2296000	2298000	The second
2298000	2300000	ADAPTING THE LANGUAGE USED
2300000	2302000	TO SUIT THE STUDENTS' LEVEL
2302000	2304000	See people speak human language
2304000	2306000	See ghosts speak ghost language
2306000	2308000	According to the student's level
2308000	2310000	To adjust his
2310000	2312000	INSTRUCTION
2312000	2314000	Even sometimes
2314000	2316000	I really use bilingual
2316000	2318000	Not all English
2318000	2320000	He may not understand this student
2320000	2322000	So he thinks this is
2322000	2324000	Will make the student understand
2326000	2328000	That
2328000	2330000	Another reason is that
2330000	2332000	But this has nothing to do with the student's level
2334000	2336000	His explanation is another
2336000	2338000	Because of the student's attention
2338000	2340000	In order to understand the teacher's English
2342000	2344000	Is there a student interview here?
2344000	2346000	The teacher explains something
2346000	2348000	We will pay more attention
2350000	2352000	OK
2352000	2354000	He said this
2356000	2358000	If we don't pay attention
2358000	2360000	Then we
2360000	2362000	We wouldn't have been able to play
2364000	2366000	OK
2366000	2368000	So the student should be very focused
2372000	2374000	So his explanation is
2374000	2376000	Because the student is focused enough
2376000	2378000	Understand
2378000	2380000	The student's physical activity
2380000	2382000	He justified
2384000	2386000	To explain why
2386000	2388000	Physical activity will be good
2390000	2392000	So it's interesting
2392000	2394000	From my professional point of view
2394000	2396000	I think this is interesting
2396000	2398000	I dare not say ridiculous
2398000	2400000	Because the previous article
2402000	2404000	The article talks about
2404000	2406000	Because the teacher said too much
2406000	2408000	OK
2408000	2410000	I want to say
2410000	2412000	You didn't see the previous article
2412000	2414000	You can see it here
2414000	2416000	What is it called?
2416000	2418000	Physical
2418000	2420000	Look at a good article
2420000	2422000	This may be Q2
2422000	2424000	Tier 2 or above
2424000	2426000	Q1
2426000	2428000	Both are good articles
2428000	2430000	Then
2430000	2432000	From my professional point of view
2432000	2434000	I said that it can be published
2434000	2436000	What does it mean?
2436000	2438000	It means that the current research
2438000	2440000	This aspect
2440000	2442000	The gap is still very large
2442000	2444000	Very large
2444000	2446000	This is what I mean
2446000	2448000	So actually
2448000	2450000	At present, my understanding is
2450000	2452000	Research on scientific research
2454000	2456000	Mostly
2456000	2458000	Besides review
2458000	2460000	What is the topic?
2460000	2462000	What is the topic?
2468000	2470000	This is one
2470000	2472000	The other is similar to this
2474000	2476000	Is
2476000	2478000	Experiment
2478000	2480000	Case study
2480000	2482000	Accurate design
2482000	2484000	Or
2484000	2486000	This kind of field
2486000	2488000	Actual observation
2488000	2490000	Then
2490000	2492000	And so on
2492000	2494000	Or the teacher himself
2494000	2496000	Domestic is also doing
2496000	2498000	The teacher himself
2498000	2500000	Design
2500000	2502000	Design a course
2502000	2504000	Then look at the amount of students' language
2504000	2506000	Double language
2506000	2508000	See if his wisdom has improved
2508000	2510000	Or learn motivation
2512000	2514000	This is one I have seen so far
2514000	2516000	But it has a lot of details
2516000	2518000	Just this teaching strategy
2520000	2522000	He has a lot of scenes to play
2524000	2526000	Because you are all teaching
2526000	2528000	Strategy
2528000	2530000	You just have a multi-fidelity
2530000	2532000	Maybe another one will be made
2532000	2534000	The problem is what do you want to do with this one
2536000	2538000	His
2538000	2540000	The contribution on the table becomes
2540000	2542000	I have to look at the paper again
2542000	2544000	So this is currently
2544000	2546000	I think
2546000	2548000	I think he is a
2550000	2552000	If you are
2552000	2554000	This part of the words
2554000	2556000	Can also talk
2556000	2558000	Because cross-border double language policy
2558000	2560000	Can also do
2560000	2562000	Because some people have been misunderstanding
2562000	2564000	Say
2566000	2568000	Because the time is an hour
2568000	2570000	I want to ask
2570000	2572000	Do you mind
2572000	2574000	Let's enter the Q&A time
2574000	2576000	I have to finish
2578000	2580000	So what I mean
2580000	2582000	This becomes
2582000	2584000	He can do a lot
2584000	2586000	Including national recognition
2586000	2588000	Can do
2588000	2590000	He can do a lot of material
2592000	2594000	So the conclusion is the front
2594000	2596000	Some key points
2598000	2600000	Everyone knows that the national strategy is like this
2600000	2602000	We have to consider
2602000	2604000	How to use it
2604000	2606000	Take it as your own
2606000	2608000	Then because of the double language
2608000	2610000	After all, if it is related to the educational field
2610000	2612000	He is actually a
2612000	2614000	It's a science and art
2614000	2616000	So if you order a meal, you have to go
2616000	2618000	Figure it out
2618000	2620000	Because I want to listen to the audience today
2620000	2622000	Everyone is a talent
2622000	2624000	I believe in the future
2624000	2626000	Taiwan's double language
2626000	2628000	There has always been a chance
2628000	2630000	These detailed policies are still
2630000	2632000	Especially in the second part of the country
2632000	2634000	The country is currently like
2634000	2636000	The teacher who wants to take the double language
2636000	2638000	He himself does not have a foreign language level
2638000	2640000	So this is a problem
2640000	2642000	Then the science and art part actually has a lot of
2642000	2644000	There are many gaps and different directions
2644000	2646000	It's worth it
2646000	2648000	It's worth it
2648000	2650000	To study
2650000	2652000	The above is my sharing today
2652000	2654000	With
2654000	2656000	Five-point conclusion
2656000	2658000	Thank you for your listening
2686000	2688000	There is no
2688000	2690000	How to face the gap between the rich and the poor
2696000	2698000	I feel
2702000	2704000	This is from social science
2706000	2708000	If I am a policy maker
2708000	2710000	Of course I will hope
2710000	2712000	Divide resources
2712000	2714000	To the disadvantaged
2714000	2716000	All the way
2716000	2718000	This is
2718000	2720000	I think this is
2720000	2722000	Not just in Shuangyu, many
2722000	2724000	Many departments
2724000	2726000	There are also many infrastructure
2726000	2728000	Do it like this
2728000	2730000	For example, there is a road here
2730000	2732000	Do I have a road in the east?
2732000	2734000	Then you also see
2734000	2736000	It becomes
2736000	2738000	I think this is all
2738000	2740000	The government is doing it, because now
2740000	2742000	In fact, this part of the home network
2742000	2744000	Because in Taiwan
2744000	2746000	Even Lidao, he has a network
2746000	2748000	So now there is
2748000	2750000	Online, so he actually has nothing to do with Shuangyu
2750000	2752000	Become resources
2752000	2754000	Give you a computer
2754000	2756000	Then there is a match for you, this is not a problem
2758000	2760000	He knows that talents can be sent to you
2760000	2762000	I think this is the policy end
2762000	2764000	Or the executor is doing it
2764000	2766000	He tried to do this
2766000	2768000	This is from a structural point of view
2768000	2770000	Everyone knows the answer now
2770000	2772000	Or go back to a
2772000	2774000	Screen gap
2774000	2776000	I am not very rich
2776000	2778000	I am a middle school
2778000	2780000	I am a middle school
2780000	2782000	Our home
2782000	2784000	Still personal
2786000	2788000	Investment in Shuangyu
2788000	2790000	The psychological
2790000	2792000	Should be imagined
2792000	2794000	No matter how much you give
2794000	2796000	No interest in learning
2796000	2798000	There is no way
2798000	2800000	So the screen gap
2802000	2804000	Taipei
2804000	2806000	The resource environment is good
2806000	2808000	English is still bad
2808000	2810000	So in a way
2810000	2812000	Resource allocation or screen gap
2812000	2814000	It's just a structural problem
2814000	2816000	It looks like a problem
2816000	2818000	The real problem is back to the executor
2818000	2820000	itself
2820000	2822000	Did he block his antenna
2822000	2824000	This is my answer
2824000	2826000	You
2826000	2828000	What angle do you look at this
2828000	2830000	You should emphasize
2830000	2832000	Just
2832000	2834000	They have no way to
2834000	2836000	Open that antenna
2836000	2838000	Because we say there are many
2838000	2840000	Many people are ignorant
2840000	2842000	So the focus is on
2842000	2844000	Besides the policy
2844000	2846000	Is there any possibility
2846000	2848000	More friendly environment
2848000	2850000	That friendlier environment
2850000	2852000	Maybe it's not just
2852000	2854000	Close this kind of
2854000	2856000	You give him a flat screen
2856000	2858000	Computer or
2858000	2860000	Or a visual problem
2860000	2862000	He may have some
2862000	2864000	Some other accessories
2864000	2866000	Other problems include that
2866000	2868000	Maybe because I know some
2868000	2870000	Just
2870000	2872000	Just
2872000	2874000	On the execution side
2874000	2876000	Or say
2876000	2878000	Students
2878000	2880000	If he is not interested
2880000	2882000	How do you deal with it
2882000	2884000	This is a problem that stimulates the group
2884000	2886000	Colleagues and their own
2886000	2888000	Some family factors
2888000	2890000	This is not a single face
2890000	2892000	Can consider
2892000	2894000	This is the answer I can think of
2894000	2896000	Then there is another one here
2896000	2898000	Is the applicant
2898000	2900000	The problem is
2900000	2902000	Although the education language and related areas
2902000	2904000	There is a lot of discussion about the bilingual education policy
2904000	2906000	But the public in Taiwan
2906000	2908000	The impact of this policy is limited
2908000	2910000	How should we make the public
2910000	2912000	How should we make the public
2912000	2914000	How should we make the public
2914000	2916000	How should we make the public
2916000	2918000	How should we make the public
2918000	2920000	How should we make the public
2920000	2922000	I think Taiwan
2922000	2924000	Taiwan
2924000	2926000	It should not only be bilingual
2926000	2928000	Is everyone
2928000	2930000	Because the common people are mostly
2930000	2932000	I care more about his daily life
2932000	2934000	For example, you said
2934000	2936000	You said that Caiqi
2936000	2938000	Cai's stall
2938000	2940000	he
2940000	2942000	Does he value bilingual
2944000	2946000	Does he have a cell phone
2946000	2948000	But the news he may see
2948000	2950000	It's not what we care about
2950000	2952000	His same level as us
2952000	2954000	Different
2954000	2956000	So if you say you
2956000	2958000	You want this bilingual
2958000	2960000	Is to make everyone feel important
2960000	2962000	Should be able to enjoy
2962000	2964000	His
2964000	2966000	Sweet story
2966000	2968000	So I mean the bilingual policy
2968000	2970000	Your propaganda
2970000	2972000	I think I do a lot
2972000	2974000	Because you are now in Taiwan
2974000	2976000	The street is full of bilingual
2978000	2980000	Public transportation
2980000	2982000	Excessive
2982000	2984000	Our COVID-19 propaganda
2984000	2986000	There is also English
2986000	2988000	So I don't think it's in the media
2988000	2990000	Or policy announcement
2990000	2992000	This part is not
2992000	2994000	But it is clear that Taiwan is doing it
2994000	2996000	But the problem is
2996000	2998000	Because he has no way to let the general public
2998000	3000000	To use bilingual
3000000	3002000	So I mean
3002000	3004000	If you ask this industry
3004000	3006000	Bilingual policy is to open up
3006000	3008000	The opportunity for international talent to operate in Taiwan
3008000	3010000	Because of us
3010000	3012000	Talent
3012000	3014000	It should be said that our current population
3014000	3016000	Group
3016000	3018000	With that kind of culture
3018000	3020000	Distribution is still local
3020000	3022000	This is what we are talking about
3022000	3024000	What this province
3024000	3026000	Hakka
3026000	3028000	There are some new names
3028000	3030000	But we have fewer English-speaking countries
3030000	3032000	You really have to distance
3032000	3034000	To let everyone know more about the necessity of this policy
3034000	3036000	Just take Tianmu
3036000	3038000	Tianmu itself is a
3038000	3040000	Tianmu and Xinyi District
3040000	3042000	Why was it built as a bank?
3042000	3044000	Demonstration area
3044000	3046000	Because he is there
3046000	3048000	There are people from English-speaking countries
3048000	3050000	In this situation
3050000	3052000	He can't buy vegetables in Tianmu
3052000	3054000	He can't speak Chinese
3054000	3056000	He has to use
3056000	3058000	He can only speak English
3058000	3060000	Then we say that we don't really understand these people
3060000	3062000	He has to use
3062000	3064000	Appropriate English to interact with him
3064000	3066000	But you have to talk a little bit
3066000	3068000	Then this is what I said
3068000	3070000	Every day must
3070000	3072000	You don't have to promote this situation
3072000	3074000	He has to learn
3074000	3076000	So in the long run
3076000	3078000	Bilingual policy
3078000	3080000	What we are doing now
3080000	3082000	How do we let talents come in?
3082000	3084000	English-speaking willing to come
3084000	3086000	Then he can
3086000	3088000	Live everywhere in Taiwan
3088000	3090000	Work
3090000	3092000	and so on
3092000	3094000	Then naturally we were talking about those
3094000	3096000	People who don't really understand him
3096000	3098000	Let me go to Australia
3098000	3100000	You are in the United States
3100000	3102000	There are Indians around
3102000	3104000	There are
3104000	3106000	Anyway, non-Americans
3106000	3108000	Then we all have to
3108000	3110000	Communicate in the same language
3110000	3112000	If it is like this in Taiwan now
3112000	3114000	We communicate in the same language
3114000	3116000	It's called Chinese
3116000	3118000	But now there is one more
3118000	3120000	The second language is English
3120000	3122000	Then he will
3122000	3124000	Become a must
3124000	3126000	That's called Affordance
3126000	3128000	Because there are many foreigners
3128000	3130000	Now it's called Guangdong
3130000	3132000	But in case the future is long-term
3132000	3134000	Then it will become a
3134000	3136000	Let's take the past
3136000	3138000	Taiwan speaks more Minnan language
3138000	3140000	Later
3140000	3142000	The civil war retreated
3142000	3144000	Chinese
3144000	3146000	Mandarin becomes
3146000	3148000	To speak like this
3148000	3150000	Then it will be mingled
3150000	3152000	That's how it is now
3152000	3154000	So the policy
3154000	3156000	Too much is just an expression
3156000	3158000	The reality is
3158000	3160000	People come in
3160000	3162000	He lives here
3162000	3164000	We naturally understand
3164000	3166000	The necessity of bilingual
3166000	3168000	This is
3168000	3170000	Can go longer
3170000	3172000	That's another way
3172000	3174000	I want to add
3174000	3176000	Of course this process needs to wait
3176000	3178000	And then the other
3178000	3180000	During this waiting
3180000	3182000	Our bilingual skills in the cloud
3182000	3184000	Express
3184000	3186000	B
3186000	3188000	Sentence pronunciation
3188000	3190000	Use words
