00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
TARA is an organization for young researchers in Taiwan.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
We have a TARA Talk every week on the weekends.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
The format and content of this talk are very diverse.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Academic researchers can come here to share their research results,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
practice giving presentations,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
or get to know potential future collaborators.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
Next week and the following week,

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
we will have a presentation on quantum physics and machine learning.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
If you are interested, you can sign up for our presentation announcement.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
You can also scan the QR code to sign up for future presentations.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
You are also welcome to follow TARA's Facebook and Instagram.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
If you are interested in becoming a member,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
you can scan the QR code here,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
or use the link in the chat.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
We have a special Slack channel for TARA members.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
We will share various activities, work opportunities,

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
or new information in the relevant fields.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You are very welcome to join us.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
In today's event, we will also issue a TARA badge.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
This is the NFT blockchain.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
The TARA badge looks pretty good.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I will put the relevant information in the chat later.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You can take a look at it.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
At the end of the presentation, we will announce the receipt of the badge.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It requires a password.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
We will announce it at the end of the presentation.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
If your phone cannot install the POAP app we use,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
you can leave it after the presentation.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
We will discuss how to solve it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Let's get back to the topic.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Today's speaker is Lin Shujing.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Shujing completed her university and master's degree in Taiwan.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
She studied medical imaging and brain science

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
at Zhongshan Medical School and Yangming University.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
During her university days,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
she trained as a clinical radiologist.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
During her master's degree,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
she studied fMRI analysis in the brain function group of Dr. Long.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
During her master's degree,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
she studied neuroscience at UBC University in Canada.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
During her master's degree,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
she studied the connection between functional neuroimaging

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and the cognitive functions of neuropaths.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
She focused on neural network analysis.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Currently, she is a research fellow

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
at Montreal Neurological Institute in Canada.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
She is on a business trip in Germany.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Based on Chaira's tradition,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
please turn on your microphone

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
and welcome the speaker.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Are you ready?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
3, 2, 1.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Thank you for your cooperation.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
I will stop sharing the screen.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
The stage is yours, Shujing.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Thank you.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Hi, everyone.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm at the hotel in Munihae.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I hope the internet connection is stable.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I hope there won't be any problems.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
If there are any problems,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I will try again later.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Please bear with me if there are any problems.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Okay.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Today, I'm going to talk about

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
neuroimaging.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
What is neuroimaging?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
What is neuroimaging?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
What is neuroimaging?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
What I'm going to talk about today

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
is a paper in MNI.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
This paper was accepted

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
last year.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I will mainly talk about the main points.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I will also talk about some details.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I will put the reference in the end.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You can read it if you are interested.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Or we can discuss it later.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
My title is a bit long.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Neuroimaging can predict

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
the effect of a patient's treatment.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Let's take a look at the topic.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
It's a bit slow.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
First, I will talk about

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
the general background information.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is not related to

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
what I'm going to talk about today.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
It's mainly for the general concept.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
The main point is

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
what I'm going to talk about today

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
is an application.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's an application using multivariant.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Why do we use multivariant

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
instead of univariant?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Univariant is a more traditional method.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It can indeed increase your statistical efficiency.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
But it's too simple.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
You can't know much about it.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
There are many new evidences.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
There are many different diseases.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Neuroimaging, neuroinflammatory,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
and other diseases

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
are not caused by a single factor.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
If you use univariant,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
you can't see the other important details.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
The advantage of using multivariant

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
is that you can see the multidimensional association.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
You can find a comprehensive effect

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
instead of a single number or variable.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
In this way, you can know more precisely

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
the relationship between your data and clinical trials.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The research I'm going to talk about

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
is mainly used in Parkinson's disease.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
It's a clinical trial.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
The main purpose is

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
to see if the baseline data

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
can predict the improvement

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
after the treatment.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
This is our central idea.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Next, I'm going to talk about

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
the research I'm going to talk about.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
First, I'm going to talk about

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
neuropsychology.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
What is Parkinson's disease?

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
It's a disease related to action.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
The main cause is

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
a neuroendocrine in the brain.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
For some reason,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
we can't tell you what the reason is.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
For some reason,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
the neuroendocrine gradually dies.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
On the right,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
in the normal human brain,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
this place is called the substantia nigra.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
There are many black cells,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
the so-called dopamine neurons.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
But in the patient,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
the black cells are gone.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
They become white.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
These cells are dead.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
They can't transfer the neuroendocrine

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
to other areas of the brain.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
This will cause many clinical symptoms,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
including exercise and non-exercise symptoms.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
The so-called exercise symptoms

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
we often hear is resting tremor.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
If the patient is sitting,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
his hands will keep shaking.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Or non-exercise symptoms,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
such as cognitive impairment,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
or some patients have insomnia, etc.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Because it's not just a professional exercise symptom,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
we say that

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
every patient is a little different.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So we say it's heterogeneous.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Everyone is different.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
It's not just the so-called dopamine system that's affected.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Other neuroendocrine systems are also affected.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
So we think this is also a so-called multifactorial disease.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It's not just a single factor that affects this disease.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The current treatment includes

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
the first and most common,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
which is drug control.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Usually, this drug control

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
is quite good for most patients.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
But for some, I don't know why,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
they don't react well to this drug.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
If this is the case,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
we can consider another way,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
called deep brain stimulation.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Deep brain stimulation is actually very invasive.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
But for some patients,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
it's a very effective treatment.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
But it has one drawback,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
which is that it's very invasive.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Neuroendocrine is actually buried in the brain.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
This electrode connects to a battery.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
The battery is placed in the patient's chest.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
About every five years,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
the battery in the chest needs to be replaced.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But it's very invasive.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Not every patient can do this kind of surgery.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So far, we have another way,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
which is the one I'm going to talk about today.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
I don't know what to do with it.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Because we usually call it

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
hard-focus ultrasound.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
This method uses

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
precise positioning with the help of imaging

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
to see which area of the brain

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
needs to be stimulated.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
The hard-focus ultrasound

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
is a similar way of surgery

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
to damage the brain tissue.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
This will cause the brain to

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
change the connection of the brain circuit.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
After the change,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
it can improve some problems in the movement.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I saw the news a few weeks ago.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
There is news like this in Taiwan.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It seems to be about MRI navigation

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
to teach ultrasound therapy.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It sounds terrible.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I will talk about the hard-focus ultrasound.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's easier.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But the problem is,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
although this method

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
can work well for many patients,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
not everyone

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
can get the same result.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
This is what we are still wondering about.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Why?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
So we might think

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
it's because we need some predictions

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
before the treatment.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And these predictions

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
are not for the whole group,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
but for each patient.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So we need to predict the result

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
to see if the patient

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
is suitable for the treatment.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Another important question is

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
we need to understand

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
what is the actual effect

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
of the ultrasound.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Although the treatment

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
is very effective so far,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
we are still not 100% sure

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
how it works.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
So this is also an important question.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Next,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
let's talk about the main purpose of this research.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
This is a simple way

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
to show

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
what we are doing.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm not sure

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
if I have a laser pointer.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Let me see.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Okay,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I have a laser pointer.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
There are two main ways.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
The first one

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
is to see

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
if we can use

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
the pre-treatment data

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
to predict the post-treatment results.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
The second one

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
is to see

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
if the clinical results

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
after the treatment

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
can be explained

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
by the pre-treatment results.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Can the clinical results

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
be explained

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
by the pre-treatment results?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
We mainly use

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
multimodal neural imaging

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
and clinical data

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
to see

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
if we can achieve

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
the two goals.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Let me briefly introduce

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
our patients.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
There are only

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
35 patients

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
with Parkinson's disease.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
These patients are monoclonal.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
They are more affected.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Originally,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
we planned to receive

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
at least 50 patients.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
However,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
this clinical trial

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
was conducted in Spain,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
which is our partner.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
However,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
COVID-19 happened

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
halfway through

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
the clinical trial.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
The Spanish side

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
seemed to be slightly interrupted.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Several patients

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
were unable to

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
enter the clinic.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
These patients

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
are monoclonal.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
They are treated

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
with focus ultrasound.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
After the treatment,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
after 24 hours,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
MRI imaging is performed

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
to see

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
if the focus ultrasound

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
reaches the desired level.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
The white arrow

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
is the so-called lesion.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It is the effect

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
of the focus ultrasound.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
This is the so-called

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
subthalamic nucleon.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I did not see

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
the whole process.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
However,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
according to my lab boss,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
the whole process

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
took a long time.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Let me take a sip of water.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
The patient

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
was treated

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
with focus ultrasound.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
After positioning,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
the focus ultrasound

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
reached the brain area.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
At the same time,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
neurosurgeons

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
continued to

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
perform ultrasound

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
to see

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
if the patient's symptoms

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
had improved immediately.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
At the same time,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
neurosurgeons

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
checked the temperature

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and the condition of the patient.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
According to the patient's

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
immediate response,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
if the patient's symptoms

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
had improved,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
they would stop the ultrasound.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
The whole process

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
took about 1-2 hours.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
On the right,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
we can see

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
the difference

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
between the two

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
types of motor symptoms.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
These are the motor symptoms

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
assessed by neurosurgeons.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You can see

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
these four types

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
of motor symptoms.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
They all improved

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
very well.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
From baseline

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
to

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
our baseline,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
the patient

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
was treated.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Three months later,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
the patient was treated.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
This is the fourth month.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You can see that

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
their treatment was very good.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
The performance of the ultrasound

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
is good.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
As for the actual method,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
let's take a look at it

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
because there are too many details.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
In short,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
we use structural imaging

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and functional imaging.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Structural imaging

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
refers to TY-weighted MRI imaging.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
The first step is to

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
perform the imaging.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
The imaging process

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
involves a lot of processing.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
In the end,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
what we need

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
are some numbers.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
In functional imaging,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
we need these two numbers,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
F-alph and Re-alph.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
F-alph refers to

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
the low fluctuation

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
in the racing set.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It's a bit like

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
the quantum number.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Re-alph refers to

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
the regional homogeneity.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It refers to how similar

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
the regions of the brain are.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
In structural imaging,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
what we need are

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
the gravimetric density and

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
the gravimetric atrophy,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
which refers to

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
how much

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
the patient's

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
brain shrinkage

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
has shrunk.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
These are the four

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
different numbers,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
and we put them

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
into our analysis.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
This is our

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
multimodal neural imaging phenotype.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
In statistical analysis,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
we use

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
multivariate cross-correlation,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
which is the same

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
as POS,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
partial least square.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
In this way,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
we can see

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
the relationship

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
between two different data.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
In this experiment,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
the two different data

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
refer to images,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
which are the features

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
of the brain.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
The other data

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
refers to how much

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
the patients have improved.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
This is a simple graph.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
If you're not familiar with

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
POS,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
this is a simple graph

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
of X and Y.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
The purpose of POS

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
is to find the

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
X times A1.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
A1 refers to

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
the weighting of X.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
We find the

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
X1 times A1

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
plus X2 times A2,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
and so on.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
We find the linear combination

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
and the linear combination of Y.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
These two combinations

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
are closely related to each other.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
They are maximally co-variated.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
In this way,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
POS will think

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
that this is the pattern

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
that we observe.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
This is the relationship

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
between the two features.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
In addition,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
we will do a lot of

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
statistical methods

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
to determine

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
what we observe

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
is meaningful in statistics,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
including permutations and boosts.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The purpose of boosts

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
is to see

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
which variables

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
are important

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and which are not.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
These variables

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
are brain areas

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
or clinical data.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We need to see

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
which variables

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
are important

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and which are not.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
This is another graph.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
It's a bit like

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
a simple

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
progress bar.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
In this progress bar,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
we have FMI and T1,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
which are functional and structural data.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
In terms of clinical data,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
we calculate

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
how much

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
the baseline and month for

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
have increased or improved.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
The first analysis

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
is to use

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
two sets of variables.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
The first set

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
is imaging

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and the second set is clinical improvement.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
In the process,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
we will also put

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
covariables,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
such as age, gender,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and how long the patient has been sick.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
We will remove

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
these covariables

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
in a linear way,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
so that we don't have to

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
worry about these factors

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
when we look at the results.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
The second analysis

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
is to see the difference

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
between baseline and month for,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
not just baseline or month for.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It's to see the difference between them.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
The other set of data

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
is clinical improvement.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
We also put

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
some covariables in here.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Next,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
we will look at the results.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
The main results

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
are shown on the right.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
The main result

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
is to see

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
the X-weighting

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and Y-weighting.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
The bigger the X-weighting,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
the more important

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
the Y-weighting is

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
to the patient.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
If we look back at the results,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
these bars

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
are the weightings

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
we just saw.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
This is the simplest way

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
to show

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the results.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
This is the clinical data,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
and this is the imaging data.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
How do we interpret this?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
You have to look at the bars.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
If they are

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
all positive,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
you can see

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
that the bars

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
are positive.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
The bars are positive.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If the bars

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
on the positive side

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
are on the negative side,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
the bars on the negative side

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
are on the positive side.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
The bars on the positive side

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
are more.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
The bars on the negative side

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
are increasing.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The bars on the negative side

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
are decreasing.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Of course,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
we don't put this on paper

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
when we write paper

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
to make it more beautiful.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
This is another picture.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
In addition to the

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
positive and negative

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
bars,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
the left upper corner

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
also tells you

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
how much

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
the image

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
is related to

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
clinical data.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
In short,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
about 82%

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
of the data

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
can be interpreted.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
This is quite high.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It means that

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
what we see

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
can represent our data.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
When we do

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
permutation,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
this is the result of permutation.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It also means that

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
it is related to statistics.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
These are the improvements.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
There are comprehensive

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
motor improvements,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
or rigidity,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
or tremor,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
which are specialized improvements.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
In short,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
these improvements are related to

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
imaging.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
These two pictures

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
are structural.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
They include

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
small brain,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
superior parietal lobe,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
or deep brain.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
This is grammatical density.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
It is also seen in

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
superior parietal lobe,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
pecuniary parietal lobe,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
and small brain.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
what we see after

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
clinical treatment

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
is that

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
these improvements

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
are related to

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
these brain areas,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
not just single brain areas.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
The second result

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
is that

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
we use the difference

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
between baseline

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
and month 4

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
as our

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
imaging data.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
The same is true

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
for the two groups

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
of the same image.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The two images

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
are related to each other.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
We draw the same picture

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
in this way.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
We see that

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
90% of the data

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
is explained

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
in this way.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
This is also quite high.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
We also see that

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
these clinical improvements

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
are related to many brain areas.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
In terms of functional brain areas,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
we also see some

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
in frontal lobe,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
paracentral,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
precuneus,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
hippocampus,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
and temporal lobe.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
In terms of functional

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
brain areas,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
we also see many

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
brain areas,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
including small brain,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
C-section,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
and even in

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
precuneus.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
We can also say that

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
the effect of this treatment

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
is not limited to single brain areas,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
but many different brain areas.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
In particular,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
there are many small brain areas.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
At the beginning,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
we were surprised

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
that there are so many

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
small brain areas.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Later on,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
we found a way

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
to explain it.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Later on,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
we found a way

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
to explain it.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
First of all,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
we can use baseline

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
to predict the effect

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
after the treatment.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
In other words,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
when the patient's

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
post-treatment effect is greater,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
the number of brain areas

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
will be relatively higher.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
In other words,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
patients with

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
strong treatment effect

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
may show

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
more atrophy.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
may show more atrophy.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
In other words,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
the patient's brain

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
shrink more,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
and less gravitational

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
density.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
In other words,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
the patient's brain

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
shrink more,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
and less gravitational

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
density.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
In addition,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
the patient's brain

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
is not in single-brain area,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
but in many different areas.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
In conclusion,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
if the patient's

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
MRI

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
shows

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
severe atrophy,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
the treatment

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
may be better.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
In other words,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
ultrasound treatment

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
can be used on severe patients.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
The second part

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
is the difference

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
between the baseline

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
and the pre-treatment patients

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
As we can see in this way,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
many posterior brain areas

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
appear on the MRI.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
This yes

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
depends on the function

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
and the structure of patients.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
This depends on the function

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
and the structure of patients.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
These posterior brains

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
although the patient's

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
target is in the subthalamus

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
although the patient's target is in the subthalamus

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
in that brain area,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
the effect of the treatment

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
is spread out in that area

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
to the frontal,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
to the parietal,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
and to the cerebellum.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
There is an important link

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
from the midbrain

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
from the midbrain

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
to the cerebellum.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
to the cerebellum.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
to the cerebellum.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
There is a long white line

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
in the middle.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
There is a long white line

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
in the middle.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
The brain connects

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
the brain areas.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The effect of the treatment

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
is spread out from the midbrain

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
is spread out from the midbrain

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
like a telephone line,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to the parietal.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
to the parietal.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
to the parietal.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
to the head

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
to the brain

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
to the brain

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
to the head

28:33.000 --> 28:35.080
so we can see a significant change

28:35.080 --> 28:37.000
in the brain

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
so we can see a significant change

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and the brain becomes an important indicator.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
We done this a year

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
and I'd like to know

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
which type of patient

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
we should focus on

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
but

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
how can we do more?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
how can we do more?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I mean

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
how can we

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
push the current

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Parkinson's treatment

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
to a single patient

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
to a single patient

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I mean how can we

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
push the current treatment

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
to a personalized level

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
There are many ways we can do

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
not just group-wise

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
not just group-wise

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
say, he is sick

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
then we can do that

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
and if he is not

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
then we can do another way

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
or if he is this type of patient

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
then we can do that

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
because there are many patients

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
who can't do it

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
who can't do it

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
so we need to

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
design the treatment

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
for those patients

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
another thing we can do is

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
before clinical trial

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
before clinical trial

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
we carefully select the patient

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
some patients are suitable

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
some patients are not

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
this is also a way

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
or we can build a lot

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
in a mathematical or engineering way

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
to build the so-called brand model

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
to use these models to predict

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
the after-effects

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
we can also do

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
the so-called disease subtyping

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
that is, patients are not all the same

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
there may be many different subtypes

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
and different subtypes

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
may be suitable for different treatments

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and so on

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
so

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
let me talk about business

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
our lab

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
is currently doing the so-called

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
precision medicine

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
especially in neuroendocrine

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
the lab also developed

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
a NeuroPM Bot

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
its purpose is to let you do

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
a lot of different analysis

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
this is the main

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
a little bit like you

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
open this toolbox

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
and see what it looks like

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
our toolbox can actually

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
use a lot of different data

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
not just the image

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
in addition to the image

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
of course you can also

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
use clinical data

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
cognitive function detection

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
or blood or gene

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
and so on

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
this interface

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
our toolbox

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
can be used for visualization

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
it can see which brainstem

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
is important

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and then

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
this is a flowchart in paper

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
see what you need today

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
if you want to do

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
disease subtyping today

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
you can use this module

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
this is called CTI

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
if you want to do other parts

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
you can go here

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
if you have multi-modal imaging

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
you can do other things

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
if you only have a single image

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
there are so many kinds

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
you can use ESM

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
ESM is mainly

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
look at where the disease

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
starts in your brain

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
to find the source of the disease

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
the other one is to see

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
the relationship between different modalities

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
or

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
on this side

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
the so-called fingerprint

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
you can see

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
if you want to

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
visualize a patient

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
how much effort

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
does it take

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
to restore a patient's brain

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
this kind of information

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
is more effective

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
in developing design

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I personally

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
have more experience

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
in this part

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
other people in our lab

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
have more experience

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
this is my lab code

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
you can download it

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
on the lab website

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
CTI is mainly

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
disease subtyping

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
and disease staging

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
if you have a lot of patients

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
let's say

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Parkinson's disease

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
we can find

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
these three

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
if there are three different

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
we can find these three

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
at the same time

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
we can see

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
if this patient is

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
the most like a normal person

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
he is not so sick

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
so the color is light

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
or he is already

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
very serious

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
that is more red

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
so we call it

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
pseudotype

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
if you use imaging

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
how serious is the disease

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
we call

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
estimated disease severity

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
this is the result

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
in the paper

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
let's say there are a lot of normal people

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Alzheimer's disease

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
and Huntington's disease

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
we use CTI to

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
classify them

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
they have their own

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
trajectory

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Alzheimer's disease

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
their estimated disease severity

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
which is pseudotype

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
is very similar to

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
clinical indicators

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and Huntington's disease

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
is related to their disease stage

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
so we get these pseudotypes

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
actually it is quite meaningful

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
finally

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
this should be the last

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
sharing time

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
we are currently preparing a

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
workshop

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
the time will be in spring or summer

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
we haven't decided

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
the location will be at Montreal Neurological Institute

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
if you are interested in

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
coming to Montreal, you can try it

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
there will be two days

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
the first day will be

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I-GET-TALK

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
there will be students

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
or postdoc session

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
the second day will be

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
hands-on workshop

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
we will introduce

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
how to use NeuroPM toolbox

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
or other precision medicine

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
toolbox

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
we will ask people to

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
introduce to you

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
we haven't decided

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
the time or the content

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
but if there is any news

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
we will put it on the lab website

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
roughly

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
this is

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
what we are going to talk about

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the paper on

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
focus ultrasound treatment

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
if you are interested

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
you can read it

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I have saved a lot of details

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
this is the paper on

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
toolbox

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
there is a manual

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
this is the funding agency

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
thank you

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
any questions?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
thank you

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
someone

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
want to ask a question

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
yes

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
me

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
ok

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
hello

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I am Charlene

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I want to ask

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
when you use ultrasound

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
to treat your brain

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
will the

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
dopamine

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in your brain

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
recover?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
frankly

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
no

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
we have

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
clinical trial

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
for a long time

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I haven't seen

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
the latest data

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
but

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
according to clinical trial

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I can tell you

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
there is no such thing

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
but the purpose of ultrasound

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
is to

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
cut off

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
the brain

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
and make a lesion

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
the whole

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
dopamine

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
recovery

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
the whole loop

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
will be cut off

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
it will

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
improve

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
the whole process of

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
dopamine transmission

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
in theory

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
we can't see

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
the regeneration of dopamine

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
but we can

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
change the way

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
dopamine is transmitted

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
in the brain

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
in a physical way

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
ok

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
thank you

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
thank you

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I want to ask

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
the time and strength of

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
ultrasound

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
should be considered

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
yes

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
that's right

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I haven't been to

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Spain

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
to see their actual operation

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
but I know

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
neurosurgeons are

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
well-prepared

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
to keep positioning

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and test other

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
well-known data

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
indeed

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
the strength

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
must be strictly monitored

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
the treatment time

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
depends on the patient

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
so

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
from the beginning to the end

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
the strength and time

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
depends on the patient

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
they will move their hands

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
like this

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
to see if the motor

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
has improved

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
if they find

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
the motor has improved

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
they can stop

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
the ultrasound

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I've seen

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
other papers

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
like

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
to see if the data

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
for example

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
the temperature of

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
the brain

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
will rise

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
to what degree

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
is safe

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
how strong

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
and so on

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
if

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
we want to

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
apply the results

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
to the clinical trial

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
we will discuss with

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
neurosurgeons

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
to see if

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
we can

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
apply the results

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
to the clinical trial

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
we do have

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
a plan like this

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
but we haven't started

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
yet

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Thank you

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I also have a question

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
outside the door

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
you mentioned

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
a lot of treatment

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I'm wondering

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
if quantified

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
has side effects

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
yes

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
usually

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
after the treatment

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
within 24 hours

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
they scan the MRI

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
to see the lesion

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
the picture I showed

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
in the slide

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
and also to see

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
if there are any other

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
complications

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
in the brain

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
after 24 hours

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
the patient will come back

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
for follow-up

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
they will

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
based on the clinical trial

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
called UBDRS

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
to assess

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
the whole process

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
to see if it is good

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and other

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
quality of life

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
to see if there are

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
other complications

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
indeed

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
there are

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
two patients

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
were removed

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
due to complications

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
one of them

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
should be

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
better

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
but worse

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
so

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
we need to discuss

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
why

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
they did

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
a series of

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
assessments

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
the general question

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
is about

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
your background

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
why did you

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
switch from medical imaging

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
to neuroscience

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I was

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
interested in

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
imaging

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
especially brain imaging

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
when I was

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
an intern

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I was an intern

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
in clinical trial

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
at that time

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
we had our first

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
research institute

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
we wanted to

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
apply the imaging

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
in clinical trial

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
to

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
neuropsychiatry

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
not just

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
X-ray

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I was interested

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and I read

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
a lot of books

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
when I was

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
an intern

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
I wanted to

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
apply MRI

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
to patients

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
with mental

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
or neuropsychiatric

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
diseases

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
but

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
due to other reasons

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I chose

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
FMRI

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
although

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I did other

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
experiments

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
first

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I wanted to do it

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
and second

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I could only apply to

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
neuroscience

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
in Taiwan

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
many students

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
apply to

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
radiology

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
medical physics

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
but

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
there is no

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
radiology

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
in Taiwan

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
thank you

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
for your answer

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
do you have

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
other questions?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
if not

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I will

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
ask another question

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
thank you

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
for your speech

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I am not a

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
neuroscientist

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I am curious

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
what do you think

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
is the most difficult

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
part of this research?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
collecting patient's data

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
or marking

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
brain areas

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
which part

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
do you think is the most difficult?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think the most difficult

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
is how to

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
write the result

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
clearly

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
so that patients

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
can see it

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
it is hard

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
but I am not collecting data

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
we are collecting data

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I know they spent a lot of time and effort

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
but

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
for me

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
the most difficult part is

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
when we see the result

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
how do we

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
calculate the weighting

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
we see in PRS

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
we say weighting is important

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
but if you tell a neuroscientist

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I see this weighting

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
he will think

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
you think it is useful

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
but I don't think so

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I want to know

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
how to treat patients

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
so we spent a lot of time

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
thinking

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
how to write the result

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
clearly

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
in a language

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
that is suitable for

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
clinical doctors

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
so that they can know

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
the result is effective

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
for me

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
the most difficult part

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
is when we explain

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
these variables

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
the relation between positive and negative

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
is very complicated

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
we need to

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
write it in several layers

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
the first layer

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
is to explain the result

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
positive or negative

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
the second layer

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
is to write

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
because it represents

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
the physiological meaning

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
in this process

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
we spent a lot of time

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
but luckily

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
when the paper was sent

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
the feedback

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
was good

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
most people understood

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
so we took a deep breath

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
that sounds really good

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
thank you

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
it was special

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
because I studied English

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
so we never

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
have the same field

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
but you have

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
clinical and academic

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
you need to communicate

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
like engineers

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
and physicists

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
you need to communicate

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
thank you

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
do you have other questions?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
countdown

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
3

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
2

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
1

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
thank you

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
for your participation

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
thank you again

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
thank you

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Sujin

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
thank you

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
we have

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
a questionnaire

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I will turn off the recording
