1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In today's talk, we have Tao Yizhe.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
His topic is Taiwan bilingual policy and education review.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The speaker is a teacher with physical education, health education, and English teacher certificate.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He has studied in the US, Europe, the Ministry of Education, and the University of Queensland, Australia.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
His research interests include professional development, education, and sports-related issues.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
His doctoral research topics include language learning, cross-cultural communication,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
how to find language learning experience,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
long-term bilingual education experience,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the participation and observation of Taiwan education and society in recent years.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is the first time in the country that a bilingual policy and education review can have a deep understanding of macroeconomic analysis.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
According to our TARA tradition, we will turn on the microphone to welcome the speaker.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are you ready?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you are ready, let's give him a round of applause.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Are these guests in Taiwan or in the US?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Can I know the background of the audience?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I am in the US.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Dr. Chen Tian-Yuan.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What about the others?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can you turn on the microphone?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know why you are here.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I will start now.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I thought it was yesterday.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The time you sent me seems to be yesterday.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't schedule anything yesterday.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, I may not be here for a long time.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If I have a chance, I will share it with you.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am a teacher in high school.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am in the second year of Zheng University.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am also a professor in the Center for Calculus in Zheng University.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I teach calculus.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As you can see in my resume,

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have worked with a lot of organizations.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's get back to my background.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am a senior student.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I majored in PE.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I like English.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I took the English exam in high school.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When I was in college, I wanted to major in English.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, I took the English exam.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't need to take the exam now.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just need to apply for the exam.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, I got my license after graduation.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There are not many PE majors in China.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I also have an English license.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
English helped me a lot.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, I may share it later.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I hope to observe and comment on the state of Chinese in China.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I still have some ideas.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is related to my learning experience.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When I was learning English,

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
my English teacher had little influence on me.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We all learn by ourselves.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The point of self-study is that

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the Ministry of Education has been talking about the direction of education.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I learn English not for the exam.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, I started to apply English in my daily life in middle school.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, this is how I do it.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
When I went to school,

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would ask my classmates to try to interact with me in English.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
At that time,

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was 46 years old.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When I was in my teens,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
it was hard to take the college entrance exam.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was not easy to take the exam at that time.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was too late to prepare for the exam.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was hard to speak English,

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
listen to English music,

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and check the English list.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
However, this kind of learning experience

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
was helpful for the exam.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So, it also influenced

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
my objective view of the current topic,

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the policy of bilingualism.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Anyway,

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I got the scholarship from the Ministry of Education.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then, I chose the Human Movement Studies

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
at the University of Queensland, Australia

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
as my major to study

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
in the Department of Science and Regional Studies.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At that time,

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
my research was focused on...

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
As I was studying in the Department of Science and Regional Studies,

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I got the scholarship from

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sports Coaching and Training.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was focused on the direction of natural science.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That was the general trend in Taiwan.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
However, when I went to Australia,

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I followed my teachers.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They went to areas like

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sports Psychology, Sports Education,

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sports Society,

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and the disciplinary area.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Therefore, my doctoral thesis

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
was focused on direct research.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I studied the topic

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
of a local organization

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
representing the Olympic Games.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The key word is

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Workplace Learning.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Workplace Learning is an area

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
that I use.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I studied the professional talents

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in the area

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and how to develop professionally.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The Olympic team I chose

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
was actually

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the Olympic diving team.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you go to Australia in 2000,

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you can get a gold medal

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
for diving in a row.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you have a certain understanding

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
of sports,

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you know that diving is usually

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
dominated by China.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why did Australia get a gold medal

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
for diving in a row?

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because they hired

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
foreign coaches.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Especially,

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Chinese elite coaches.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Therefore, my research topic

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
was to study how these people

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
learn and develop

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
through cultural exchange.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Of course, the focus

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
was mainly on the coach himself.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
For example, how did he get

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
his professional skills?

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Of course, it has to do with his

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
professional experience or

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
where he has taught.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
However, there is an important point

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
about their cross-cultural communication.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In other words,

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
their language,

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because the requirements in Australia

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
are different from Taiwan.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Foreigners go there

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to learn

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in their official language.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
For example, in Taiwan,

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
if you know,

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
like Howard,

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
but we still send

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
translators for him.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is the difference in nationality.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
However, in Australia,

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
no matter where you work,

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
even if you are a chef,

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
or a professional,

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you have to use

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
their official language to communicate.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Therefore, this is a challenge

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
for foreign coaches,

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
especially for non-English-speaking countries.

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Therefore, my research topic

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
was to ask them how they learned

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
their language.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In this process,

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I integrated my own

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
master's training,

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
personal interest in long-term English,

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and the training

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in my research.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Therefore,

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I have this part

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
of my language policy.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The most important thing is that

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in fact, in the country of 2030,

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
or the policy of 2030,

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
before it started in 2017,

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I had been teaching

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
for more than 15 years.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
In 2000,

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
when I was working

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in a school,

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
or when I was

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
a teacher,

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was actually

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
trying to teach

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
all-English or

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
sign language sports.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Therefore,

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I have 15 years of experience in this area.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because of this situation,

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I have become

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a problem for many

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
domestic

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
frontline workers,

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
teaching staff,

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or those who

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
criticize

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the policy.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have no problem with

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
this.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
However,

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
in theory,

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I may not be able to

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
implement the framework

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
of English.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Therefore,

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have to learn

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
not only from

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the experience of

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
ethics,

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but also from

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the experience of

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
science.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Therefore,

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
in addition to my

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
major,

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have been

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
teaching

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
for more than

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
15 years.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is also

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
a major

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
interest of mine.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is also

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
a major

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
interest of mine.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is also

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
a major

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
interest of mine.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In addition to

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
studying in Australia,

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I went to

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the United States.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Before I went to

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
the United States,

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
although the English

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I learned in Taiwan

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
was not typical,

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I still found

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
some differences.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
For example,

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
their everyday English

239
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
was different from

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
our training.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This made me

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
think about

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
what I should do

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to improve my English.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For example,

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
when I traveled to

247
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Europe,

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I went to

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the International

250
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Olympic Youth Conference

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in Greece.

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I noticed that

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the official language

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
was English.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I noticed that

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
the official language

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
was English.

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We're the

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
scholars of Taiwan,

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Japan, and Korea.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're all based in LGBTQI community.

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I was the

263
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
moderator of

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the Japanese and Korean

265
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
oral posters yesterday,

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which means I am the host of them.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But I was the moderator of

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the Japanese and Korean

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
oral posters yesterday,

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
which means I am the host of them.

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have a good feeling about the details

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
of the post.

273
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have a solution, of course.

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, today I'm going to

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
talk about a few

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
key issues.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And how far

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the research has gone.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's see if we can interact.

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This chart

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
shows

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
my language learning.

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm learning

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
PopFish,

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and I'm using

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
language in my daily life.

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm using language in my daily life.

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's about it.

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's about it.

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's about it.

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
As I mentioned earlier,

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
As I mentioned earlier,

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
if you're interested,

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
if you're interested,

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if you're interested,

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you can google my name.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You'll find

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
many comments

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and articles.

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and articles.

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Besides my book,

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I have many other articles.

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you're interested,

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you'll find

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and articles

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Chinese

343
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Chinese

344
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Chinese

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Chinese

346
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Chinese

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Chinese

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Chinese

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Chinese

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Chinese

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Chinese

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Chinese

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Chinese

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Chinese

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In my opinion

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Shuang Yu should

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
go further

358
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
rather than

359
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
looking for

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
so-called

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
non-exams

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
subjects

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
like sports, art, music

364
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and so on

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He is still learning

366
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Chinese math

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
calculus

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
biology

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and so on

370
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When it comes to sports

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
he suddenly changes to bilingual mode

372
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is a

373
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
very interesting question

374
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you look at it

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
from many perspectives

376
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In Taiwan

377
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Shuang Yu

378
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
has a...

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's take a look at this chart

380
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why is there so much discussion

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in Taiwan

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
so far?

383
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There are basically three reasons

384
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Three perspectives

385
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The first one is

386
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
a mess

387
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
To be honest

388
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Shuang Yu is obviously

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
going to drop out of school

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Taipei City

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
will announce 100%

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Shuang Yu will drop out of

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
high school

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In fact, they are also

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
moving in this direction

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All schools in Taiwan

397
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
have been

398
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
looking for

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Shuang Yu program

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Shuang Yu teaching

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
or Shuang Yu class

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
including high-level EMI

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So if you happen to be

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
in the United States

405
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
studying

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
In fact, before 2013

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you were relatively smart

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because you

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
People believe you can

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
EMI

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That is, you can teach in full English

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But we

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
are from the same city

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But more teachers

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
educate

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and learn

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
acquire their teaching experience

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
locally in Taiwan

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So their Shuang Yu policy

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There is no way

421
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So in this situation

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
what I said

423
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Three kinds

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
One is a teacher

425
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
will say this policy

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just kidding

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Opposed

428
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The second is like us

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because we think about its benefits

430
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You get a lot of benefits

431
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
of these people

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Or you have seen

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That is,

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
English can really

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
lead us

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
At least we can

437
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
quickly push ourselves

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
or learn foreign things

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is what we think is good

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So YES

441
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
In the middle, he did not understand

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He just like Wu Bing

443
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
will drift

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In this case, you will find

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that all policies are the same

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He just voted

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I just finished voting last week

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
YES, I vote for you

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Or NO, I vote for you

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
All the same

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So I may

452
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
talk about this first

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The first question

454
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In the end, Shuang Yu country

455
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What are you doing

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Shuang Yu policy

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
He is not in 2017

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He is in 2000

460
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He is a think tank

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
in Hainan

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You go to read that

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Taiwan's English policy

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In addition to our traditional understanding

465
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
English teaching

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Taiwan's English teaching

467
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think it is quite successful

468
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It should be said that the so-called success is

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Our

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
English is at least better than Japan and Korea

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
At least better than Japan

473
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know why

474
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Maybe because

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Our relationship with the United States

476
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or

477
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Taiwanese

478
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Watch a lot of HBO

479
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Japanese should watch

480
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is learning English

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
English

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But now you have to be comprehensive

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
To many subjects

485
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Even industrial

486
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There are some banks in Taiwan

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They are now holding Shuang Yu demonstration area

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The question is

489
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why do we have Shuang Yu

490
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is Shuang Yu class in English class?

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What if the teacher

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't teach Chinese

493
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What to do

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There are some teachers who want to do Shuang Yu

495
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Some are like us

496
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Where is the beef

498
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Is there any place

499
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is all

500
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
A very interesting

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So this question

502
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Everyone is like this

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Everyone has an answer

504
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Different answers

505
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But back to a

506
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Level of tool value

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The answer may be this

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Just for

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Take it as a

510
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Weapon

511
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It is a tool

512
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It is a tool for communication

513
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It is a

514
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Our National Development and Reform Commission

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And so on

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Claimed

517
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Can let us sell to the world

518
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Especially the English class world

519
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because they are still in the world

520
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Leading

521
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Whether in technology

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Or

523
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Leading on many systems

524
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The so-called lead is

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That is

526
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They are stronger

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
To be honest

528
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's all relative

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Then we can follow these

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Powerful people

531
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They can understand us faster

532
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it is good

533
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This situation

534
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Why 2030 Shuang Yu

535
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shuang Yu

536
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
policy

537
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
of course

538
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This question

539
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
country

540
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
No special

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You may have a bottom in your heart

542
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I just talked about two thousand years

543
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Tainan Gang

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Think of this strategy

545
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Then you

546
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Since Tainan Gang

547
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You will think of some color problems

548
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That

549
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
in fact

550
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It is very clear that

551
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He is actually

552
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
a

553
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Going to America

554
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Strategic policy

555
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That is to say

556
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No matter how much you talk about

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But now

558
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Two months ago

559
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We all know that Pelosi flew to Taiwan

560
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then why not

561
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Li Keqiang is in Taiwan

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
My question is like this

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It means that Shuang Yu

564
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Policy is actually in

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
language

566
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Do you say

567
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Weakened Chinese

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Someone proposed

569
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Didn't we all say that Guo Wenke

570
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Zhou Wenke is even a university teacher

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Shuang Yu

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Of course he also has his thoughts

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But why did he let people

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Study English

575
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That is obviously

576
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Have his

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The consideration of our partnership

578
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Just like our New Southbound

579
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He doesn't want to

580
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Put all the eggs on the shore

581
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He wants

582
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
How kind

583
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Especially to report the correct answer

584
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So this is what you see

585
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This situation

586
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So this situation is

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We want to say

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So you have to understand

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
In the end

590
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This policy

591
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What are those people thinking

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
what

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and so

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is also

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Then you think about it

596
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Then I want Shuang Yu today

597
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What do I think about it

598
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Why is the environment so noisy

599
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You may have

600
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Think about it slowly

601
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I think this is

602
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is a low part

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Then I personally feel

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Shuang Yu

605
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
For Taiwan

606
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The reflection of the education system is very good

607
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
because

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He

609
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We are talking about cross-fields now

610
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That is actually

611
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
English

612
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Non-English class

613
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
He is actually helping to some extent

614
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
English class

615
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What is English class doing

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Our English class is actually

617
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Many are in

618
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Preparing for the exam

619
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Early reading and writing

620
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Writing words

621
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Understand grammar

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Write some short texts

623
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
In the past ten years

624
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Twenty years

625
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The country began to test

626
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Listen

627
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But he still didn't get the number

628
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So it becomes our students

629
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Used to learn English

630
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So when it comes to real foreigners

631
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I can't speak a word

632
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So I think Shuang Yu

633
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
At this time

634
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Not only expand his

635
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
English learning

636
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
In addition to imagination

637
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He is also

638
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Will return to one

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If you put it

640
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Think clearly about this matter

641
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You will find out

642
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Teacher

643
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Can use the right words

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
To solve the problem of our long-term education

645
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is to focus on the exam

646
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Instead of application

647
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Of course the exam is also an application

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But that is to say

649
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The exam is expected

650
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That may be three years later

651
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That time

652
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Or the usual period

653
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But I'm talking about the applicability

654
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The breadth and depth is

655
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You may

656
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In this situation

657
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You may think in

658
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Ordinary

659
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
For long-term application

660
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Then international

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think this is a

662
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Shuang Yu to

663
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
An opportunity point

664
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This is probably the case

665
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This question is a bit

666
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Professional Shuang Yu

667
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Teaching

668
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So probably

669
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Needless to say

670
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Take a look

671
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I should have a question

672
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Let me see

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I think it's still simple here

674
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Just say ok

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
If Shuang Yu

676
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Today

677
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
In

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Our purpose

679
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Everyone has a certain idea

680
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Then maybe a speech

681
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Can be done

682
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Then you will meet one

683
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
When Shuang Yu goes to class

684
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
In fact, if you

685
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm going to college

686
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
How to teach

687
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
In fact, it is called ENI

688
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Written here

689
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But now

690
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
For example, you

691
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You have to put your subject in full English

692
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
In fact

693
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This is also the case in the international market

694
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Many international schools

695
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm not talking about universities

696
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Research Institute

697
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
International

698
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When everyone is looking for a job

699
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
ENI

700
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Then go to ENI

701
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's all

702
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No competitiveness

703
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Of course, under middle school

704
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That is to say, he may have a lot of teaching

705
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Strategy

706
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Then use some of his subject

707
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Theoretical framework

708
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Then go to Shuang Yu teaching

709
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
This part of the domestic people are less talking

710
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's just me

711
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can think of this thing

712
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Of course, because I have a book

713
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So probably this situation

714
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I speak faster

715
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Shuang Yu teaching

716
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In fact, in the end

717
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
How does he say

718
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
He didn't say you think

719
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's important that you do it

720
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but

721
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He wants to go back to a learning site

722
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because we all know that students actually

723
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The gap is very large

724
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So there are people using that screen gap

725
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
He will expand

726
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Weakness

727
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
With that kind

728
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Their imagination is English

729
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Home is better

730
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So this one

731
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Cultural language

732
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What capital is pulling more

733
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So when the teacher was on

734
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There is also a

735
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Maybe he studied English

736
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So he decided to read science

737
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Still have to read English

738
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Now Shuang Yu

739
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Simply put, it's actually Shuang Yu

740
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He will meet one later

741
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Whether you are well prepared

742
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Can students accept

743
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Always a problem

744
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So he is a teacher

745
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A two-way interaction

746
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So you teach any class

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You teach any client without Shuang Yu

748
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Also encountered this problem

749
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So it becomes

750
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The reflection inside is very important

751
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
The teacher's sensitivity

752
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because the teacher has power

753
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Of course now students

754
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
They start to have a say

755
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
They will criticize you

756
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So this becomes

757
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This duality becomes important

758
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But another level of Shuang Yu

759
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I also mentioned here

760
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It is also less mentioned in China

761
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Must consider language and culture

762
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Duality and equality

763
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it is good

764
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Because many of us

765
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You can show English

766
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Very awesome

767
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But this is a bit like

768
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's a bit like saying

769
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Self-respect

770
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Self-respect

771
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I think this mentality is very bad

772
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A better mentality should be

773
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Equal to each other

774
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For example, when we are today

775
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
When Shuang Yu was teaching

776
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Uh

777
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You see a lot of English teachers

778
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
When a lot of Shuang Yu teachers are in class

779
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
His blackboard is full of English

780
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then he speaks a lot of English

781
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then he tried to teach

782
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, that's fine

783
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
If you can absorb

784
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I will expand your experience

785
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I think Shuang Yu

786
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Another level is

787
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You should put your own good things

788
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Use the language that the other person understands

789
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Teach him

790
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Just this is called English

791
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So for example, when I go to

792
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Sports class

793
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
In addition to going abroad

794
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Some sports

795
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I will also work hard to teach students

796
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Put your own good things

797
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For example, martial arts

798
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Martial arts

799
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What do you know

800
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Teach foreigners

801
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
For example, this time you use English

802
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You don't have to learn from others

803
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But you have to put your own good things

804
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Teach others

805
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Even if we are in the United States

806
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
When I was studying in New York

807
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
When I was studying in Australia

808
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We want to cook a Taiwanese dish for each other

809
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That concept

810
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You know our good

811
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Then

812
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You teach your good

813
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Hamburger for me

814
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I introduce my delicious

815
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'll give you a pancake

816
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is mutual

817
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So language design

818
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Shuang Yu course design

819
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I will consider this

820
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Won't go over

821
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But they have to come over

822
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think this part is quite important

823
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I also think this is

824
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is pushing the Shuang Yu course

825
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There must be something local

826
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
International

827
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Local

828
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
This thinking

829
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Ok now back to me

830
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Maybe

831
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Maybe these

832
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Maybe with us

833
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This

834
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because we all have the right

835
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What is the current level of domestic and foreign Shuang Yu research

836
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If you

837
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Some of you who come to listen today

838
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I think this is

839
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Probably the same

840
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That is to say, this is a very good graduation topic

841
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Because in addition to the journal

842
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There has always been a need

843
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There are idols

844
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
P1

845
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
There is a need for this kind of journal

846
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There are people who make people confused

847
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
We will use different methods

848
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We will find different problems

849
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Then use different methods to solve it

850
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Because it always has

851
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
A mysterious color

852
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
People will be together because

853
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I don't understand

854
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Ha ha

855
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's like this at the moment

856
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Shuang Yu

857
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Research in China

858
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
at present

859
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There is

860
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Continuous output

861
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That foreign trend

862
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Foreign trend

863
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Especially in the field of language

864
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There are also many

865
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Then I have

866
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
If you look at this field

867
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think there is a very interesting place

868
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I will introduce one here

869
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Such a piece

870
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This one is about Spain

871
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
One of their case studies

872
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
White Linguist

873
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I think this one is more interesting

874
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Because he

875
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Just like all research

876
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
In one

877
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
This kind

878
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Direction

879
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Will produce a lot

880
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Sometimes the opposite

881
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
found

882
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Basically he is talking about this one

883
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Will Shuang Yu

884
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Affect the amount of physical activity

885
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This research question

886
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Ask this

887
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That

888
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In fact, the amount of physical activity

889
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Is the imagination of everyone in the gym

890
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I want you to come to the gym today

891
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I usually hope you have

892
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Exercise

893
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Don't say what kind of technology

894
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You just

895
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Heart rate increase

896
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
To run a few thousand steps

897
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Sweating

898
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then I think you have reached

899
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Certain requirements of the gym

900
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So his thinking is

901
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If I come in today

902
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Will it cause this

903
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Positive or negative

904
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What is their relationship

905
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Ask this

906
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But this question

907
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In fact, you use another department to ask

908
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
For example, I brought you in today

909
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Mathematical ability

910
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Does it affect the teaching section?

911
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Wait a minute

912
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Will it cause good or bad

913
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He asked you

914
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So you can see from this one

915
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He is

916
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Selected

917
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Some key words

918
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Then he hopes

919
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Students can achieve moderate

920
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Vigorous physical activity

921
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Medium strength

922
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Moderate

923
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A little tired

924
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Physical activity

925
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then he defined it as

926
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MVPA

927
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The teaching mode he uses is

928
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
CLEAR

929
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Compton Language Integrated Learning

930
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The so-called bilingual teaching mode

931
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Very popular in Europe

932
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Then he went to intervene

933
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So one of the groups is

934
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
CLEAR mode

935
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Experimental group

936
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Experimental group is normal teaching

937
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The thinking is like this

938
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Then go

939
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Quantified to start doing

940
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
How does he do it

941
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
He just let the students

942
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Put that

943
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Maybe a calculator or something

944
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
He talked about that thing

945
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Measure his activity

946
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Then test

947
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
A few weeks

948
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Of course you

949
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There is a fact of teaching

950
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So he knows

951
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
He wants to invite

952
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
One of the participants is

953
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
CLEAR teacher

954
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Come to teach

955
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That

956
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Before the result

957
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I thought they had another group

958
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Research

959
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They found it would affect

960
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The so-called

961
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Obstruction

962
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Reduce students' physical activity

963
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There was another team before

964
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's like this

965
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Because the amount of language is too much

966
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Leading to a decrease in student exercise time

967
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is this side

968
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Hit him

969
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Hit him here

970
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
No

971
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Look at this

972
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
% of time per session spent on

973
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
MVPA

974
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Use CLEAR

975
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you see the average value?

976
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
GENERAL

977
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
35.15B

978
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The control group of CLEAR

979
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Obviously high

980
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
OK

981
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Probably

982
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
A lot higher

983
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Boys and girls have

984
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
His instrument

985
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The amount is shown

986
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Very simple research

987
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Then he will explain now

988
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This result

989
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Why is that so?

990
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The previous explanation said because the teacher

991
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Too much nonsense

992
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Language orientation

993
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
OK

994
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Let me tell you

995
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because he used something

996
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This table

997
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
COMMUNICATIVE TEACHING STRATEGY

998
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That is to say

999
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What

1000
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The way the teacher uses

1001
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
REFORCING THE MESSAGE

1002
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
REFORCING THE MESSAGE

1003
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THROUGH THE COMPLEMENTARY NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION CHANNEL

1004
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That is

1005
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We say

1006
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
When the teacher teaches in Chinese

1007
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So I'll tell you

1008
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Use more

1009
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
POSTURE, GESTURE

1010
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Or EYE CONTACT

1011
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You

1012
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Like this

1013
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
NONVERBAL

1014
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You can say this

1015
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
This is one

1016
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
His strategy

1017
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The second

1018
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ADAPTING THE LANGUAGE USED

1019
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
TO SUIT THE STUDENTS' LEVEL

1020
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
See people speak human language

1021
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
See ghosts speak ghost language

1022
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
According to the student's level

1023
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
To adjust his

1024
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
INSTRUCTION

1025
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Even sometimes

1026
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I really use bilingual

1027
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Not all English

1028
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He may not understand this student

1029
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So he thinks this is

1030
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Will make the student understand

1031
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That

1032
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Another reason is that

1033
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But this has nothing to do with the student's level

1034
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
His explanation is another

1035
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Because of the student's attention

1036
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
In order to understand the teacher's English

1037
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Is there a student interview here?

1038
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The teacher explains something

1039
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We will pay more attention

1040
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
OK

1041
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He said this

1042
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If we don't pay attention

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Then we

1044
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We wouldn't have been able to play

1045
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
OK

1046
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So the student should be very focused

1047
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So his explanation is

1048
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Because the student is focused enough

1049
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Understand

1050
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The student's physical activity

1051
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He justified

1052
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
To explain why

1053
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Physical activity will be good

1054
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So it's interesting

1055
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
From my professional point of view

1056
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think this is interesting

1057
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I dare not say ridiculous

1058
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Because the previous article

1059
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The article talks about

1060
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Because the teacher said too much

1061
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
OK

1062
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I want to say

1063
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You didn't see the previous article

1064
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You can see it here

1065
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
What is it called?

1066
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Physical

1067
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Look at a good article

1068
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
This may be Q2

1069
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Tier 2 or above

1070
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Q1

1071
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Both are good articles

1072
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Then

1073
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
From my professional point of view

1074
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I said that it can be published

1075
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What does it mean?

1076
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It means that the current research

1077
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
This aspect

1078
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
The gap is still very large

1079
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Very large

1080
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is what I mean

1081
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So actually

1082
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
At present, my understanding is

1083
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Research on scientific research

1084
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Mostly

1085
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Besides review

1086
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What is the topic?

1087
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What is the topic?

1088
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This is one

1089
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The other is similar to this

1090
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Is

1091
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Experiment

1092
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Case study

1093
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Accurate design

1094
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Or

1095
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
This kind of field

1096
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Actual observation

1097
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Then

1098
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And so on

1099
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Or the teacher himself

1100
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Domestic is also doing

1101
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The teacher himself

1102
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Design

1103
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Design a course

1104
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Then look at the amount of students' language

1105
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Double language

1106
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
See if his wisdom has improved

1107
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Or learn motivation

1108
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
This is one I have seen so far

1109
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But it has a lot of details

1110
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Just this teaching strategy

1111
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He has a lot of scenes to play

1112
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because you are all teaching

1113
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Strategy

1114
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You just have a multi-fidelity

1115
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe another one will be made

1116
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The problem is what do you want to do with this one

1117
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
His

1118
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The contribution on the table becomes

1119
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I have to look at the paper again

1120
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So this is currently

1121
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I think

1122
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I think he is a

1123
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If you are

1124
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
This part of the words

1125
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Can also talk

1126
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Because cross-border double language policy

1127
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Can also do

1128
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because some people have been misunderstanding

1129
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Say

1130
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Because the time is an hour

1131
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I want to ask

1132
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Do you mind

1133
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let's enter the Q&A time

1134
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I have to finish

1135
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So what I mean

1136
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This becomes

1137
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
He can do a lot

1138
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Including national recognition

1139
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Can do

1140
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He can do a lot of material

1141
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So the conclusion is the front

1142
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Some key points

1143
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Everyone knows that the national strategy is like this

1144
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We have to consider

1145
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
How to use it

1146
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Take it as your own

1147
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Then because of the double language

1148
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
After all, if it is related to the educational field

1149
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
He is actually a

1150
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's a science and art

1151
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So if you order a meal, you have to go

1152
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Figure it out

1153
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because I want to listen to the audience today

1154
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Everyone is a talent

1155
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I believe in the future

1156
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Taiwan's double language

1157
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
There has always been a chance

1158
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
These detailed policies are still

1159
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Especially in the second part of the country

1160
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The country is currently like

1161
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The teacher who wants to take the double language

1162
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
He himself does not have a foreign language level

1163
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So this is a problem

1164
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then the science and art part actually has a lot of

1165
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
There are many gaps and different directions

1166
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's worth it

1167
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's worth it

1168
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To study

1169
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The above is my sharing today

1170
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
With

1171
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Five-point conclusion

1172
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Thank you for your listening

1173
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There is no

1174
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
How to face the gap between the rich and the poor

1175
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I feel

1176
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This is from social science

1177
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
If I am a policy maker

1178
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Of course I will hope

1179
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Divide resources

1180
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
To the disadvantaged

1181
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
All the way

1182
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
This is

1183
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I think this is

1184
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Not just in Shuangyu, many

1185
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Many departments

1186
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There are also many infrastructure

1187
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Do it like this

1188
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
For example, there is a road here

1189
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Do I have a road in the east?

1190
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Then you also see

1191
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It becomes

1192
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think this is all

1193
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The government is doing it, because now

1194
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
In fact, this part of the home network

1195
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because in Taiwan

1196
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Even Lidao, he has a network

1197
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So now there is

1198
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Online, so he actually has nothing to do with Shuangyu

1199
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Become resources

1200
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Give you a computer

1201
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Then there is a match for you, this is not a problem

1202
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
He knows that talents can be sent to you

1203
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I think this is the policy end

1204
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Or the executor is doing it

1205
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
He tried to do this

1206
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
This is from a structural point of view

1207
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Everyone knows the answer now

1208
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Or go back to a

1209
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Screen gap

1210
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I am not very rich

1211
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I am a middle school

1212
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I am a middle school

1213
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Our home

1214
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Still personal

1215
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Investment in Shuangyu

1216
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The psychological

1217
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Should be imagined

1218
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
No matter how much you give

1219
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
No interest in learning

1220
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
There is no way

1221
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So the screen gap

1222
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Taipei

1223
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
The resource environment is good

1224
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
English is still bad

1225
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So in a way

1226
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Resource allocation or screen gap

1227
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's just a structural problem

1228
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It looks like a problem

1229
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The real problem is back to the executor

1230
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
itself

1231
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Did he block his antenna

1232
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This is my answer

1233
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You

1234
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What angle do you look at this

1235
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
You should emphasize

1236
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Just

1237
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They have no way to

1238
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Open that antenna

1239
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Because we say there are many

1240
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Many people are ignorant

1241
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So the focus is on

1242
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Besides the policy

1243
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Is there any possibility

1244
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
More friendly environment

1245
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That friendlier environment

1246
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Maybe it's not just

1247
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Close this kind of

1248
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You give him a flat screen

1249
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Computer or

1250
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Or a visual problem

1251
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
He may have some

1252
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Some other accessories

1253
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Other problems include that

1254
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Maybe because I know some

1255
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Just

1256
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Just

1257
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
On the execution side

1258
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Or say

1259
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Students

1260
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
If he is not interested

1261
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
How do you deal with it

1262
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
This is a problem that stimulates the group

1263
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Colleagues and their own

1264
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Some family factors

1265
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This is not a single face

1266
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Can consider

1267
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This is the answer I can think of

1268
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Then there is another one here

1269
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Is the applicant

1270
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The problem is

1271
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Although the education language and related areas

1272
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There is a lot of discussion about the bilingual education policy

1273
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But the public in Taiwan

1274
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The impact of this policy is limited

1275
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
How should we make the public

1276
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
How should we make the public

1277
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
How should we make the public

1278
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
How should we make the public

1279
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
How should we make the public

1280
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
How should we make the public

1281
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I think Taiwan

1282
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Taiwan

1283
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It should not only be bilingual

1284
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Is everyone

1285
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because the common people are mostly

1286
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I care more about his daily life

1287
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
For example, you said

1288
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You said that Caiqi

1289
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Cai's stall

1290
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
he

1291
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Does he value bilingual

1292
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Does he have a cell phone

1293
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But the news he may see

1294
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's not what we care about

1295
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
His same level as us

1296
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Different

1297
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So if you say you

1298
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You want this bilingual

1299
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Is to make everyone feel important

1300
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Should be able to enjoy

1301
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
His

1302
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Sweet story

1303
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So I mean the bilingual policy

1304
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Your propaganda

1305
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I think I do a lot

1306
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Because you are now in Taiwan

1307
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The street is full of bilingual

1308
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Public transportation

1309
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Excessive

1310
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Our COVID-19 propaganda

1311
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
There is also English

1312
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So I don't think it's in the media

1313
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Or policy announcement

1314
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This part is not

1315
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But it is clear that Taiwan is doing it

1316
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But the problem is

1317
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because he has no way to let the general public

1318
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
To use bilingual

1319
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So I mean

1320
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
If you ask this industry

1321
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Bilingual policy is to open up

1322
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The opportunity for international talent to operate in Taiwan

1323
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because of us

1324
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Talent

1325
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It should be said that our current population

1326
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Group

1327
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
With that kind of culture

1328
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Distribution is still local

1329
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
This is what we are talking about

1330
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What this province

1331
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Hakka

1332
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
There are some new names

1333
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But we have fewer English-speaking countries

1334
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You really have to distance

1335
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
To let everyone know more about the necessity of this policy

1336
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Just take Tianmu

1337
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Tianmu itself is a

1338
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Tianmu and Xinyi District

1339
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Why was it built as a bank?

1340
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Demonstration area

1341
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Because he is there

1342
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
There are people from English-speaking countries

1343
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In this situation

1344
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He can't buy vegetables in Tianmu

1345
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He can't speak Chinese

1346
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
He has to use

1347
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
He can only speak English

1348
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Then we say that we don't really understand these people

1349
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
He has to use

1350
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Appropriate English to interact with him

1351
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But you have to talk a little bit

1352
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then this is what I said

1353
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Every day must

1354
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You don't have to promote this situation

1355
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
He has to learn

1356
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So in the long run

1357
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Bilingual policy

1358
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What we are doing now

1359
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
How do we let talents come in?

1360
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
English-speaking willing to come

1361
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Then he can

1362
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Live everywhere in Taiwan

1363
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Work

1364
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and so on

1365
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Then naturally we were talking about those

1366
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
People who don't really understand him

1367
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Let me go to Australia

1368
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You are in the United States

1369
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There are Indians around

1370
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
There are

1371
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Anyway, non-Americans

1372
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Then we all have to

1373
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Communicate in the same language

1374
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
If it is like this in Taiwan now

1375
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
We communicate in the same language

1376
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's called Chinese

1377
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But now there is one more

1378
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The second language is English

1379
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Then he will

1380
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Become a must

1381
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's called Affordance

1382
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Because there are many foreigners

1383
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Now it's called Guangdong

1384
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But in case the future is long-term

1385
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Then it will become a

1386
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Let's take the past

1387
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Taiwan speaks more Minnan language

1388
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Later

1389
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The civil war retreated

1390
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Chinese

1391
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Mandarin becomes

1392
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
To speak like this

1393
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then it will be mingled

1394
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That's how it is now

1395
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So the policy

1396
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Too much is just an expression

1397
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
The reality is

1398
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
People come in

1399
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He lives here

1400
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
We naturally understand

1401
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The necessity of bilingual

1402
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
This is

1403
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Can go longer

1404
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
That's another way

1405
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I want to add

1406
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Of course this process needs to wait

1407
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And then the other

1408
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
During this waiting

1409
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Our bilingual skills in the cloud

1410
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Express

1411
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
B

1412
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Sentence pronunciation

1413
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Use words

1414
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Will

1415
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Inevitably run out of Taiwan

1416
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
English or bilingual

1417
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I am with

1418
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Domestic education ideas are the same

1419
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
This is

1420
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
reasonable

1421
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Bilingual development direction

1422
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So this is also

1423
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Also OK

1424
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This is the specific

1425
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That is

1426
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Our Taiwanese bilingual

1427
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Taiwan is bilingual development

1428
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Will

1429
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Is there a line with Singapore?

1430
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
With Europe and Spain

1431
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Or many regions

1432
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Achieve bilingual and different

1433
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Direction of cultural scenery

1434
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
above

1435
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Thank you

1436
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1437
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If you want

1438
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You can turn on your microphone

1439
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Speak like this

1440
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
If not

1441
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Let's end the video

1442
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Thank you

1443
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
See you next time

1444
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Bye
