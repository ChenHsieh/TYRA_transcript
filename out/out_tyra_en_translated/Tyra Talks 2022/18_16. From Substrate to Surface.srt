00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to today's TerraTalk. I am today's host, Zhang Yan-Yong.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a speech.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today's topic is from the base to the surface.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The impact of aquatic plants on the surface of the environment and sedimentary sediments in the environment.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Chen Qian-Yong.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Dr. Chen Qian-Yong is currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Her main job is in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability Project.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Her Ph.D. is in the UIUC Archaeology Department.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Her main focus is on Interfacial Gas Transfer and Sediment Dynamics in Environmental Flows with Aquatic Vegetation.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She is currently in Oak Ridge.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Of course, she does a lot of modeling and numerical simulation.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Before she came to the UIUC and got her Ph.D.,

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
she got her Bachelor's Degree in Physics from Tsinghua University in Taiwan.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then she got her Master's Degree in Fluid Mechanics from NTU.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a wonderful speech.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you for the introduction.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My name is Chen Qian-Yong.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am honored to be able to give a lecture on Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability on Taira's platform.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As I mentioned earlier, I expect the audience to be from all walks of life.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I will try to make my presentation as general as possible.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I hope that everyone will be able to understand some of the topics in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability project.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will mainly focus on the research topics during my Ph.D.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will introduce how hydropower resilience affects the surface of the environment, and the mechanism of subsurface sedimentation.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I hope to make some small extensions and introduce some of the most popular research topics in our field.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As I mentioned earlier, I hope the whole process will be easier and more discussionable.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will briefly introduce my background.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I graduated from Tsinghua University and majored in physics.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I went to Taiwan University to major in fluid mechanics.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
After that, I moved to Illinois.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I majored in soil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am a Ph.D. in hydropower engineering.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I just finished my master's degree last month.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I just moved to the National Laboratory of Hydropower in Tennessee for the first week.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My research during my Ph.D. is mainly focused on hydropower.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Although I am now at Oak Ridge, which is famous for numerical simulation,

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
my work during my master's degree is mainly numerical simulation.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
However, during my Ph.D., I mainly do experiments and image processing.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Basically, I will place different hydropower structures in my hydropower experiments.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
or I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and see how it affects the flow of water.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then we will use high-resolution laser imaging to do hydropower testing.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will explain the more detailed experiment settings and methods later.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My main field of research is applied in environmental fluid mechanics,

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Before I get into my research topic,

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to spend some time to introduce

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering is doing.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I also want to explain what the Department of Applied Environmental Fluid Mechanics,

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower are.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I hope to give you some basic concepts.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You may have some questions about why I am studying applied fluid mechanics in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because people generally have an impression of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that it is about building houses or buildings.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In fact, it is not like that.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The Department of Applied Environmental Engineering has a very wide range of things to study.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For example, if you can see the English name of its department.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It is called Schedule of Engineering,

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In fact, in Chinese, we should refer to it as Civil or Jameson Engineering.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Then in Taiwan, generally speaking,

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we separate the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering from the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then, like TAIWEN and JIAUCHEN State University,

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
there is a Department of Applied Environmental Engineering

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering lacks Opining Institute,

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
a branch of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then ChengDinh University,

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
even has a department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In addition, the Department of AppliedEnvironmental Engineering is allowed to study mainly heavily in China,

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In fact, like in the United States,

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
generally speaking, the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering are integrated into a department.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So we call it Civil and Environmental Engineering.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In the field of Applied Environmental Engineering,

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
in fact, it includes structures, geotechnical,

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
or transportation, etc.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then the field of Applied Environmental Engineering is mainly divided into water quality, air pollution, and green energy.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Among them is the water resource engineering, natural disasters, climate change, etc.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
are all in the field between Applied Environmental Engineering and Applied Environmental Engineering.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In fact, there are a lot of professors in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering in the United States

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
are engaged in research on this area.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
OK, good.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here I want to ask you a question.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I just talked about water resource engineering,

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
which is the field of my Ph.D. main focus program.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
generally speaking, you will think of what it is about,

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what this field is doing.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That is, everyone can express their own impression.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
what do you think of?

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Does anyone want to share?

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let me talk about it first.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OK.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I may be a little awkward.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What I think of intuitively is to build a water dam,

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
or to build a channel, something like that.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes, yes.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OK, does anyone else want to share?

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
what do you think of?

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Everyone may be a little shy.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In fact, I just talked about building a water dam and then a channel.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is indeed what water resource engineering is doing.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, roughly speaking,

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I like it very much.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Our university has a course

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
called Water Resource Engineering Discussion.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And in this course,

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
when the teacher is talking,

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I like to use this picture

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to roughly explain what water resource engineering is.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Basically, it actually

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
puts all the water,

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that is, the water cycle in the natural world,

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to do research on each different component.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I personally like to divide it into

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
four different sub-fields,

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
such as aquatics,

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
groundwater,

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
aquatics,

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
water resource planning,

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and management.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As I mentioned earlier,

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
building a water dam or a channel

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
is more like aquatics.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because you may have to calculate some fluid mechanics

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to know that

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
what you are going to build

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
for your dam and base.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So it's actually a bit cross-referential

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
because you still have to

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
do some structural engineering

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
with the traditional earth and wood.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Because they understand the structure

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and we understand fluid mechanics.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But water resource engineering is actually mainly

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I like to divide it into these four.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm actually mainly focused on

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
environmental fluid mechanics.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And this thing can actually be said to be

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
one of the components in fluid mechanics.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But it can also be said to be

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
a university door that comes out independently.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Environmental fluid mechanics

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
is actually mainly about

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
how matter

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
spreads and spreads

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in the natural world.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This natural fluid can be water

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and it can also be air.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
For example, the emission of factory smoke.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then there's the construction of a water reservoir.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then the impact on natural water flow.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then there's the waves of the ocean

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and the sea cycle.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Or even the typhoon.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because I just mentioned that

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
your natural fluid can be water

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
or air.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So typhoon

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
These are actually

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
environmental fluid mechanics

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
research areas.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then I've been talking about

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
a fluid phenomenon.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's turbulence.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's called turbulence in English.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This Chinese can actually be called turbulence

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It can also be called turbulence.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So if you've ever been on a plane,

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you must have heard of it.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We often have turbulence on the plane.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What about this turbulence?

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
In fact, in fluid mechanics,

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's also a very popular

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's also a very important topic.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Like the famous physicist

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Richard Feynman

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
once said

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Turbulence is a

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's been around for over a hundred years.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And then it hasn't been completely solved.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A complex physical problem.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So what exactly is turbulence?

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Turbulence can be said to be a kind of fluid

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Fluid state

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What about when the flow rate is very small?

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Fluid is a layer-by-layer fluid.

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They don't mix with each other.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then this state

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We call it a flow.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But when you

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When the speed of the object increases,

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The flow of the fluid

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There will be a wave-like pendulum.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then the frequency of the pendulum and the government

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The flow rate will increase faster and faster.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So when the fluid reaches

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When it's past the transition stage

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It will enter

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A state called turbulence

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
When it reaches this speed

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In fact, you can find that the flow becomes

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's no longer clear.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You can't track

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Every flow

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's from the beginning to the end

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How does it flow in the middle?

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then there will be a lot of small whirlpools in the flow.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then these whirlpools

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We call it turbulence or turbulence.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The scientist here

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Propose a parameter

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's called Reynolds.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then use this parameter

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We can assess

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's how messy this flow is.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's basically a

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The ratio of fluid inertia to fluid viscosity

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So the bigger the Reynolds number

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It means that the fluid is more chaotic.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A simple example is a bee and water.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Like bees, we can know

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's very viscous.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So it's your molecule.

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's your Reynolds number.

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The Reynolds number is very small.

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So basically

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We say honey

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This kind of thing

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not so messy.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Not turbulence

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But like water

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Especially in a natural environment

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like a waterfall

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Basically because it's very viscous

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So once your inertia is very fast

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Your Reynolds number is big

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You'll find that it's basically very messy.

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then it's easy to produce this kind of turbulence.

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In the natural world, in fact,

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Most of the fluids belong to turbulence.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So turbulence is studying environmental fluid mechanics.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is a very important indicator

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, and then like a river.

252
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And then the volcano erupts

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In fact, it's all a kind of turbulence.

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A phenomenon on the environmental fluid

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes, so my research is basically

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The concept of fluid mechanics and turbulence

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Applied to ecological fluid mechanics

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is ecological fluid mechanics?

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It is to explore the interaction between fluid mechanics and ecology.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So it can be roughly divided into three major areas.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
One is fluid mechanics

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
One is what we call geological geometry and ecology.

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Interaction between each other

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Interconnection and influence

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Just give a simple example

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's like if I have some beavers.

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's what we call the water in the river.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That should be in Chinese.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because the beaver basically builds the water dam.

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We call it beaver dam

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Once this beaver

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It belongs to an ecological phenomenon

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then these animals are in the river.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Built a dam

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
After the dam is built, it will change the fluid.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Change the fluid

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It may change the entire river bed.

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So the whole geological geometry will change

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
After the geological geometry changes

280
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It may come back to affect you.

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This reasonable ecology

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because you have changed the geological

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Maybe it's more suitable for them to survive.

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So it becomes more

285
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or become more unsuitable for survival

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then they will become less

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So it's actually a mutual

288
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How to say

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
An ecological chain that affects each other

290
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ecological geometry is currently in the water resource project

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a relatively new

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And a more and more popular field

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mainly because people began to realize

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The importance of many ecological projects

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Like the redwood forest on the bank of the river

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The existence of redwood forest

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It helps to naturally block the waves

298
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Then reduce the erosion of the river

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
From the perspective of biodiversity

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
At the same time, it can also provide different species

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
An ecological habitat

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
At the same time, the large trees on the bank of the river

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Also play a similar role

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay, so much

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I hope to take advantage of the time in front

306
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Have a little concept with everyone

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What I did

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What kind of field

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Now it's time to enter my topic

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
My doctoral research

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mainly doing experiments

312
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
To explore

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
When I have these aquatic plants in the water

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's not looking at the river now

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is looking at aquatic plants

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What about those plants

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How to change the flow of water in physics

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then change the flow of water

319
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Nisa's whirlpool and the glory of the air

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But in fact

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The bottom bed of Nisa

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And the transmission

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And the glory of the air

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's always been an environmental scientist

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A very concerned research topic

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's because Nisa's flush and transmission

327
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's going to change the river for a long time

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Or wetland or river

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Or the terrain of the coast

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In fact, in these places

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Many different aquatic plants grow

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then the other side is

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The amount of water

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In fact, this importance

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Basically everyone should be very clear

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We can simply use

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
These two pictures as examples

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like the left picture

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It means that the amount of water is relatively low

340
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The right picture is a fully nourished lake

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So we can clearly find

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
When the amount of water is low

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This lake will greatly limit

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The development of the entire creature and the entire ecosystem

345
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
On the contrary, it is a system

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In an environment where nourishment and air exchange are strong

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The development of aquatic life will be relatively smooth

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And the ecosystem will be more diverse

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In addition

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The transmission between air and water

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It will also affect the entire regional climate model prediction

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Like IPCC

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We call it the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The study report in 2001

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It specifically pointed out that

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
River, lake, etc.

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The water and air exchange in the inland water area

358
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is on the water and air exchange

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There is a large proportion of this emission

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So it takes more research

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
To make further and more accurate estimates

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And then do some more accurate

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Modeling to do the whole

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Especially the correction of the regional climate model

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But the important thing is

366
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In the case of inland water

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In fact, aquatic plants play a very important role

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And their distribution is very wide

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But past research

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In fact, there is no consideration of the existence of aquatic plants

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Most of the time, it's just a simple stream

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then in a river with nothing at all

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Run

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In fact, more and more scientists have found

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This kind of simplification is actually not very

376
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Does not match the real nature

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So there are those errors

378
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So in the past few decades

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
In fact, many geophysicists

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They will start

381
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Find a way to discuss

382
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Aquatic plants affect the environment

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The impact of this stream

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then we can roughly put

385
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The impact of aquatic plants is divided into two categories

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That one category is when we

387
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
When there are plants in the water

388
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It will block the whole stream

389
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The whole operation

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So it will reduce the flow rate of the river

391
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Then change the flow of the entire river

392
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The second point is that it has changed the flow

393
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So the turbulence in the water will increase

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Here is a simple example

395
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It can be seen from this video

396
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When a stream flows from left to right

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Then if there is a pillar in the middle

398
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When it's in the middle

399
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Behind this pillar

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There will be two turbulent currents in different directions

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
At the same time

402
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Assuming that there are many in the water

403
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A plant group like this

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Then the whole stream will basically be

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Various turbulence

406
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And become very chaotic

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In addition, past research has also proposed

408
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That is, with the density of the plant group

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And the proportion of plants immersed in the water

410
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The strength and characteristics of the flow

411
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And the flow will be completely different

412
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The so-called immersion ratio refers to

413
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The proportion of plants in the water

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So it can be from

415
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's completely in the water

416
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We call it Emergent Vegetation

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's the whole thing that emerges in the water

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And then it's submerged in the water

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's Submerge

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Under different immersion ratios

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It will produce

422
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The size of the vortex

423
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And the whole

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The flow will be completely different

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The main generated turbulence

426
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Can be divided into two according to their magnitude

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
One we call

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Stem Scale Turbulence

429
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's mainly the turbulence in the video

430
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's like

431
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Behind each plant

432
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Generate horizontal rotation

433
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This vortex

434
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So then the scale of this vortex

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's with my plant

436
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This pillar

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Uh, the plant is called the meridian

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But if it's a pillar

439
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's related to its diameter

440
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, so we call it

441
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stem Scale Turbulence

442
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The other one is

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When my whole plant group

444
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Dive into the water

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Just like this picture

446
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
When you dive into the water

447
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The top of the plant group will be because

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The speed of the upstream and downstream water flow is different

449
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Because there is no plant on the top

450
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So its water flows faster

451
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The downstream

452
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Because there are obstacles

453
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So the water flow is slower

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What about the upstream and downstream flow differences

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Will produce a

456
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Vertical ratio

457
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a vertical

458
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Rotating vortex

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What about this vortex

460
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Its magnitude is

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It will be bigger

462
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Compared to my plant root

463
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What caused the stem scale to be bigger

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's what we call

465
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Uh, Canopy Scale Vortex

466
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then these two magnitudes of the vortex

467
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Will be in the water

468
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Transmitted to the surface of the water

469
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Or even the bottom of the bed

470
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
To affect the water surface

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The rate of erosion

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
With the bottom of the bed

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The whole mechanism of sandblasting and floating

474
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What about the main purpose of my research

476
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Is to do experiments

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And then to understand

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is the aquatic plant

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How to influence

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
These two questions

481
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Is

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It first changes the flow

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And then how does this flow affect

484
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's

485
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uh, our Air Water

486
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Gas Transfer

487
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And that's

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The suspension of my bottom bed

489
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes

490
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay, so what's next

491
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm going to introduce a little bit

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
My experiment method and settings

493
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, yeah, that's it

494
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know if you have any questions

495
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That is

496
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you have any questions

497
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You are welcome to interrupt me at any time

498
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That is

499
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because it may be different fields

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then sometimes it's too fast

501
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is to put some

502
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Maybe general

503
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
General people don't understand

504
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Things to say

505
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Just bring it directly

506
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So if you have any questions

507
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You are welcome to interrupt me at any time

508
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes

509
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Uh, I have a question

510
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Ok

511
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Is

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Maybe before you start

513
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This kind of rigorous

514
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Before the lab experiment

515
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There will be some

516
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I have a question

517
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Is

518
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Uh, you do research in this area

519
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In addition to

520
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Physics

521
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And this kind of physical

522
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Basic science

523
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
To understand

524
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You will need to understand

525
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Aquatic plant

526
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Is it biological

527
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Or plant-related

528
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Background knowledge

529
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Basically

530
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
If

531
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You have this knowledge

532
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's probably the best

533
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Because

534
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Uh

535
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
For example, when we set up the experiment

536
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We will think about it

537
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh, my plant

538
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That one

539
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What am I going to use to represent the plant

540
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's like my experiment right now

541
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm using

542
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll talk about it later

543
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm using a harder one

544
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That kind of acrylic

545
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That hard

546
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Acrylic

547
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It can represent

548
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Is a special plant

549
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's the plant

550
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The plant is harder

551
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That plant

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Harder

553
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The state

554
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
We can have

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There are several special species

556
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And then if you understand this ecology

557
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You will know

558
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
OK, these species

559
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Where is it mainly distributed

560
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Like a river mouth

561
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Or a more upstream river

562
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So we can use this knowledge

563
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
To design our experiment

564
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Let it go as far as possible

565
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Just in physics

566
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
With

567
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
With real

568
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
To match

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's either

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's you

571
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It depends on whether you want to be flexible

572
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The

573
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Aquatic plant

574
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Or

575
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Say

576
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The kind of plant

577
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah

578
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So

579
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Uh, for me

580
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I dare not say

581
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I

582
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I know a lot about ecology

583
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Because I am also

584
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I started to get in touch with this field during my PhD

585
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I started to go

586
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
With

587
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's like talking to ecologists

588
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That

589
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So actually this is also quite

590
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It takes a combination of cross-fields

591
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That

592
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Actually in

593
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Uh, after the speech

594
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I will

595
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Share some

596
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Very interesting topics

597
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Is that we have some

598
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Cooperate with biologists

599
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then do fish

600
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
With

601
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
With

602
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Water research

603
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I will add this later

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Um

605
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Understand

606
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Thank you

607
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is a very

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's a very good question

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ok

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ok

611
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then

612
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I will continue

613
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So now I'm going to talk about my experiment

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Settings and methods

615
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So basically

616
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The aquatic plant I use

617
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is a

618
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Circular aquatic plant

619
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What about the water flow

620
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Is driven by two different

621
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Uh, the plate rotates in different directions

622
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To drive

623
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And then we can use

624
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Control the speed of the plate rotation

625
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
To control the flow of different water flows

626
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This one

628
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is my aquatic

629
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Uh

630
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Is the photo of the experimental aquatic

631
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So basically

632
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This is not very big

633
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's the whole

634
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Uh

635
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The section of the test

636
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's about 200 centimeters long

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then the whole width

638
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's actually only 15 centimeters

639
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes

640
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So in this experiment

641
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I just mentioned

642
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I use a lot of acrylate

643
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
To simulate a plant with a higher hardness

644
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That experiment

645
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
In fact, I also have

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Do experiments with softer plants

647
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But in this study

648
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
We mainly focus on

649
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mainly want to share with you today

650
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Is

651
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Simulate some of the results of harder plants

652
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In addition to that, we are at the bottom of the bed

653
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Also laid a 10-centimeter layer of sand

654
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Is to simulate

655
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is the natural river

656
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Natural river state

657
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because there will be sand at the bottom of the bed

658
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Otherwise, how do I see the whirlpool of sand

659
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes

660
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So I just

661
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I also laid a layer of sand

662
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And then finally

663
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I put it

664
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Uh

665
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Test

666
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Is to test

667
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Water flow rate and

668
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Measurement instrument of nutrient concentration

669
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me tell you a little bit about it

670
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I use it to measure

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Uh, the water flow rate tool

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We call this system

673
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Called PIV

674
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The full name is Particle Image Velocimetry

675
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So the whole system is basically

676
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Made up of three important components

677
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is

678
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
First of all, we have to put it in the water

679
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We call it Neutral Volume

680
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Powder particles

681
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The so-called Neutral Volume means

682
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Uh, the density of its particles

683
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Has to be about the same as water

684
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then it can float evenly in the water

685
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And flow along the water

686
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Then we need a high-intensity laser

687
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
To illuminate these powder particles

688
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then finally

689
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
A high-speed camera

690
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
To capture

691
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Each time point

692
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The location of each powder particle

693
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That's like

694
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This picture is

695
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh, my whole raw image

696
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Photos taken

697
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So these points

698
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The highlights are actually those powder particles

699
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And then what happens next

700
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Once we have each time point

701
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
After the location of each powder particle

702
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We can compare

703
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's the first two

704
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Uh, in the first two images

705
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Different time points

706
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The relative location of the powder particles

707
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And then calculate

708
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The direction and distance of these particles moving

709
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And then we'll

710
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because we know

711
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We can shoot us

712
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Uh, it's the camera

713
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The time frame

714
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The frame rate

715
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So we know the frame rate

716
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
We know how much time it takes

717
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Between each frame

718
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then we have this

719
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Displacement

720
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We can go

721
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Calculate the speed of its movement

722
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then with these fluids

723
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's these fluids

724
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The movement speed of the powder particles

725
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
We can use it to represent

726
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's different locations

727
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The flow rate of the water

728
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That

729
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
As for how to measure the rate of surface oxidation

730
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We are in the water

731
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Put it in what we call

732
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This chemical substance called hyaluronic acid

733
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That hyaluronic acid

734
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It will, uh, melt in the water

735
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
To react with the oxygen molecules in the water

736
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And then it consumes the water's oxygen

737
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And then when the oxygen in the water is exhausted

738
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What about the time?

739
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We can use the right picture

740
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's this picture

741
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Uh, the oxygen concentration

742
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
To monitor the entire process of reoxidation in the water

743
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And then

744
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And through

745
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's the time it takes to reach the saturation concentration

746
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
To calculate the whole

747
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The rate of surface oxidation

748
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How much

749
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That

750
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In addition to oxidation and flow rate

751
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What about

752
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We're going to set up another set of experiments

753
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
To calculate the entire bed

754
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's, uh,

755
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The concentration of nitrogen in the water

756
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That

757
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
How to do it

758
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We are through lighting

759
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And then by the brightness of this image

760
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
To distinguish

761
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's the position of the nitrogen particles

762
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then calculate

763
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's the concentration of different nitrogen particles in the water

764
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's like this video

765
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We can see

766
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The nitrogen particles that are suspended

767
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's going to be on the white projection screen

768
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's a little bit of a reflection

769
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And then we can set a threshold

770
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And then we're going to determine that every pixel

771
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's

772
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What's its intensity

773
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And then this threshold

774
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If it's higher than this threshold

775
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Then these

776
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
These pixels we'll

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just treat it as

778
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Uh, water

779
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Because it's white

780
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But if it's lower than this threshold

781
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It means it's this little bit

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Particles

783
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And then we're going to set it up

784
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's the nitrogen particles

785
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And then

786
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And then you can calculate

787
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The entire water

788
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The concentration of nitrogen in this water column

789
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Okay, so

790
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Uh, according to the PIV

791
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We measured

792
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
We got the two sides of the flow

793
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then there's the image analysis

794
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
To analyze the concentration of suspended nitrogen

795
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's why

796
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
With these two things

797
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We can try to answer the first question

798
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Is

799
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
How does the aquatic plant affect

800
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The bottom layer of the river

801
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Before we discuss this question

802
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's first understand

803
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
How does the river wash the bottom layer

804
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The nitrogen is washed up

805
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What is the mechanism of this nitrogen suspension

806
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In fact, this principle

807
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Uh, it's a little bit like this

808
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
When the storm comes

809
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
How do people get blown up

810
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, it's

811
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Uh, it's actually the speed of the fluid

812
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's about the pressure

813
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So we can put the picture

814
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What about this object in this picture

815
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Imagine it's a person

816
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Or nitrogen particles

817
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's because the bottom layer has friction

818
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So generally speaking

819
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When you get close to the bottom layer

820
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The flow of wind or water is relatively small

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The further away from the bottom layer

822
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The higher

823
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
In fact, it flows faster

824
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
When the fluid is through the human body

825
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Or when the nitrogen particles

826
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The upper flow rate is faster

827
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The lower flow rate is slower

828
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So, uh, it's actually like

829
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
How does the plane take off

830
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This Bernoulli

831
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Uh, this principle is a bit similar

832
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That

833
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The pressure above will be smaller

834
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The pressure below is greater

835
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So provide a

836
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Because of this pressure

837
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It provides an upward force

838
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But

839
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What we need to understand is

840
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
General air and water

841
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Basically

842
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's a chaotic mess

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's what I just mentioned

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's like a typhoon

845
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The wind basically

846
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It won't keep blowing

847
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's what we look at

848
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
In terms of speed profile

849
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
In fact, this profile

850
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's an average speed profile

851
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
When the wind speed is low

852
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
People basically don't move

853
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's a momentary rush

854
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
To blow people

855
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Just give

856
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Blowing is

857
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Uh, even leaving the surface

858
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So there's actually more research

859
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Point out that

860
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What about the mechanism that actually starts the nitrogen floating

861
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's a momentary high-intensity water flow

862
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's what we call

863
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The nest flow or the mess flow

864
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What about the general river flow

865
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The mess flow is mainly caused by the friction of the bottom bed

866
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And we're going to go through this

867
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The mess flow generated by the friction of the bottom bed

868
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
With its own

869
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Nitrogen is the speed of the sink

870
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
To make a balance between the two

871
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then we can push out a

872
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
To predict a different flow rate

873
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The profile of the river's nitrogen concentration

874
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Then it's like this profile

875
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Basically, it's based on this theory

876
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's been pushed out

877
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And then with the previous experiments

878
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The density of these nitrogens

879
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's basically a match

880
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But I just mentioned a little bit

881
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What about the past model

882
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Only suitable for considering

883
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
There is no aquatic plant

884
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
There is no structure

885
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Once there is a aquatic plant in the water

886
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's like I mentioned before

887
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The whole flow will change

888
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So what about my entire speed profile

889
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It won't look like this

890
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That's from recent research

891
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's when there's a plant in the water

892
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Ah, this theory of nitrogen selection

893
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The model is not suitable

894
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's because the old model only considers

895
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Just like I just mentioned

896
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Only consider the bottom bed

897
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The effect of the friction of the bottom bed

898
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What about the picture on the left

899
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The horizontal axis represents the size of the bottom bed

900
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And then the vertical axis represents the flow rate of the river

901
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That's a very obvious trend

902
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You can see that when the flow rate of the river is greater

903
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The more nitrogen is transmitted downstream

904
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But that's what we found

905
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What about these color data points

906
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It means that there is a plant

907
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So this prediction mode

908
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It can only be in line with

909
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
These points are without any plants

910
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So this thing tells us

911
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
When we have aquatic plants

912
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We must consider at the same time

913
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The flow rate produced by aquatic plants

914
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So if we look at the picture on the right

915
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's when we consider the bottom bed sensitivity at the same time

916
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What about the flow rate produced by plants

917
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
These data in the case of plants

918
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It matches the model of this theory that we modified

919
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
In addition to this

920
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What about the overall flow rate effect

921
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's not just two plus

922
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
In fact, in addition to considering the bottom bed sensitivity

923
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In addition to the flow rate produced by aquatic plants

924
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The interaction between the two flows

925
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It will produce an additional flow structure

926
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That's what we call Coherent Structure

927
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What about this structure

928
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's usually in the back of the plant

929
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Or the place before and after

930
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then close to the bottom bed

931
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So this animation on the left is

932
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
One of our experiments

933
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Red means faster

934
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Blue means slower

935
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Then we can find that the inside of the plant group

936
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's the inside of these pillars

937
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The water flow is actually very chaotic

938
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And then when you get close to the bottom bed

939
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
There will be some high-speed water flow

940
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's the red part

941
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And then with more sand grains

942
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So we have to put this model

943
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What we call Coherent Structure

944
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This kind of interaction can also be considered

945
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So we are based on the plant

946
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The average speed of the internal water flow field

947
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
A new theoretical model

948
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And then the whole river

949
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Divided into two layers of structure

950
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What about the average speed of the upper layer

951
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Close to the fixed value

952
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So we call it the average speed layer

953
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And then in this layer

954
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's basically the sensitivity that can be ignored

955
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So in this layer

956
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The main mechanism of sand grains is from

957
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We just mentioned that the gold of the plant

958
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The back of this

959
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This kind of water level flow

960
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What about the water flow at the bottom

961
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We call it the boundary layer of the bottom bed

962
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So in this layer

963
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's the mechanism of sand grains

964
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's actually mainly from the bottom bed sensitivity

965
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And the gold of the plant

966
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I just mentioned

967
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The Coherent Structure of the interaction between the two

968
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So all three of them have to be considered

969
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
At the bottom of this place

970
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And then finally

971
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What about the new theoretical model

972
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
With us in the water

973
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What about the data obtained from the experiment

974
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The three pictures represent

975
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The density of sand grains under different currents

976
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The circle is our experimental data

977
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And the virtual line is our theoretical model

978
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So the new theoretical model is roughly

979
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's in line with the experimental data

980
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So we can look forward to

981
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This new theoretical model

982
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Can replace the old model

983
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It helps people to be more accurate

984
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
To predict

985
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's in the case of aquatic plants

986
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The density of sand grains

987
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
This will help us

988
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The whole river, lake, wetland

989
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Those sand transmission

990
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And the geological environment

991
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
There is a more accurate prediction and understanding

992
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay, so we're done with the bottom bed

993
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then we go back to the surface

994
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We're going to see

995
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The flow structure produced by the plant group

996
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
How does it affect the surface of the water

997
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The process of gas transmission

998
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What about the gas transmission of the water table

999
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's mainly controlled by three big mechanisms

1000
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And one of them is

1001
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I've been emphasizing

1002
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's the structure in the water

1003
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That is, the vortex in the water

1004
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Wait a minute

1005
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
My pointer seems to have run away

1006
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay, that's it

1007
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What about the other two main mechanisms

1008
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's the wind on the surface

1009
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The mechanism of this blow

1010
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And then there's my wave motion

1011
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's my wave

1012
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But in general

1013
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
In larger water bodies

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Like lakes and oceans

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Water table wind and waves

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's the main influence

1017
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Surface gas transmission and erosion mechanism

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But for smaller water bodies

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Like rivers or smaller lakes and ponds

1020
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
In fact, the flow structure in the water

1021
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's the main influence mechanism

1022
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And that's what I'm going to do

1023
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The main part of the study

1024
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What about the old theory

1025
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
In fact, it's mainly for simplified rivers

1026
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That is, again

1027
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That is, they ignored the water body influence again

1028
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And this model is

1029
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's like this

1030
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What about the surface of the water

1031
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There's a very thin layer of fusion

1032
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And then the air in the water table

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You can use this

1034
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This mix

1035
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
In this fusion

1036
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
By spreading

1037
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
From the surface through the fusion

1038
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Transmitted to the water

1039
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And the flow produced by the bottom layer

1040
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That is, the whirlpool in the water

1041
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
There's a certain chance

1042
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Transmitted to the water table

1043
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And then to increase the entire surface layer

1044
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The spread of fusion air

1045
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And then it increases the whole air

1046
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The speed of transmission in the interface

1047
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What about this model

1048
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It must be based on different flows

1049
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Make some assumptions to estimate

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That is, the water

1051
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The time period of the whirlpool transmission to the surface

1052
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That is, behind us

1053
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
This TS

1054
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What about this TS

1055
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It basically follows different flows

1056
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And there are different estimations

1057
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So in the case of plants

1058
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We have to do more for this old model

1059
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Especially this TS

1060
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
To make further corrections

1061
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In order to discuss the distribution of different plant groups

1062
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The impact on the flow

1063
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We experimented with three different plants

1064
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That is, one is what we call fully emergent

1065
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's basically my emergence ratio

1066
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That's one

1067
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And then there's the other half

1068
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Half of it is in there

1069
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And then there's the main part

1070
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Most of it is in there

1071
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
These two situations

1072
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So there are three different kinds

1073
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And then we also set

1074
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The density of two different plant groups

1075
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The main reason is like I mentioned before

1076
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Is that the difference in density and density

1077
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Will directly lead to different flows

1078
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And then it affects the structure of the entire fluid

1079
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And the transmission rate of the surface gas

1080
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And then there's the experiment of each group

1081
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We also control the flow of different water

1082
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And then reach different Reynolds numbers

1083
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And then we're going to talk about the structural characteristics of the flow

1084
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's a little stuck here

1085
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay, so this is our

1086
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
PIV primitive image animation

1087
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And then from this animation

1088
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In fact, we can already see

1089
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That's the difference in the flow rate

1090
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Under different immersive ratios

1091
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like the picture on the left

1092
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's fully emergent

1093
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And then we can see

1094
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
These pink particles

1095
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's going to be a little messy

1096
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There's one behind the plant

1097
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We can actually see

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It has a kind of vortex

1099
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A vortex of rotation

1100
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But in the other two

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's the immersion ratio

1102
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
When it's less than one

1103
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We can see that

1104
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's above the plant group

1105
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There will be a more vertical motion

1106
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And then we're going to

1107
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Do the flow rate analysis for it

1108
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then it's even more obvious

1109
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's in a fully emergent situation

1110
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Basically, the flow is very messy

1111
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And then the entire flow rate

1112
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The profile is basically the same

1113
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But when I was in the water

1114
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What about the bottom and the top

1115
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There will be a very obvious difference

1116
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So you can see that the top is basically red

1117
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It means that the flow rate is faster

1118
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What about the bottom

1119
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Our flow rate is slower

1120
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The profile of the average flow rate

1121
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's even more obvious

1122
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You can see this feature

1123
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
In addition to the data of the speed plant

1124
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We can further use this speed plant

1125
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
To calculate and quantify the flow rate

1126
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The strength in each flow field

1127
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The blue area represents

1128
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The area with a stronger strength

1129
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And the red one means that the flow rate is weaker

1130
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So when the growth ratio is 1

1131
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's in a fully emergent situation

1132
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The main flow comes from the stem scale

1133
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's what I just mentioned

1134
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And then the distribution of these flow rates

1135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's basically relatively even

1136
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It also represents the flow rate of the entire flow field

1137
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It can be represented as

1138
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Use the average value of the flow field

1139
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
To represent

1140
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Because it's basically distributed more evenly

1141
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But when the growth ratio is less than 1

1142
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The top of the plant group

1143
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because of the difference in flow rate between the two layers

1144
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It produces a very strong canopy scale

1145
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's more dominant in the whole system

1146
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So at this time, the entire flow rate of the flow field can be used

1147
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The maximum value of the flow rate

1148
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That is, it is usually at the top of the plant group

1149
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
To represent

1150
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Make a more dominant value

1151
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Then go back to our Modify model

1152
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So according to the result of our experiment

1153
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We use different characteristics

1154
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The strength of the flow to change the original theoretical model

1155
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Then I don't think I'm going to do it one by one

1156
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Just explore the details of the theory

1157
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Then I quickly summarize this point

1158
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That is, when the ratio of the plant group is 1

1159
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
In a fully emergent situation

1160
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We use the average strength of the flow rate of the entire flow field

1161
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
To estimate the previous one

1162
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That is, the time of this stream transmission mentioned earlier

1163
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Then finally get this new Modify model

1164
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
When the ratio of the plant group is less than 1

1165
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We use the maximum flow rate of the flow field

1166
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
To estimate the time of this stream transmission

1167
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Then finally we compare the theoretical model

1168
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The prediction and experiment data of the theoretical model

1169
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
The left picture represents the case where the ratio is 1

1170
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The right picture is less than 1

1171
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Then the horizontal axis represents the strength of the water flow

1172
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The strength of the flow structure

1173
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Then the vertical axis represents the gas transmission

1174
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That is, the rate of oxidation

1175
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So the general trend is

1176
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The stronger the flow rate in the water

1177
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The faster the oxidation rate of the water table

1178
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But there is an interesting phenomenon here

1179
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We can find that in two cases

1180
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
When the Reynolds number is less than a certain value

1181
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The rate of prediction of the entire model will be slower

1182
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's slower, sorry

1183
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Then when the Reynolds number is greater than a certain value

1184
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
The rate of prediction is shakier

1185
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Do you remember the beginning

1186
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mentioned it when I introduced the flow

1187
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The so-called Reynolds number

1188
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It is a parameter used by scientists to describe how chaotic the flow field is

1189
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What about the range of different parameters?

1190
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It can describe whether the flow field is in the flow

1191
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Overflow or flow state

1192
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So this result tells us

1193
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What about the mechanism of the transmission of the entire surface of the gas

1194
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Will be affected by the flow state of the flow field

1195
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The flow state of the flow field is changed

1196
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So let's summarize

1197
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The whole study tells us a few points

1198
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That is, the technical message

1199
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The first point is through our research results

1200
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We can know the existence of aquatic plants

1201
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
First of all, it will reduce the flow rate of water

1202
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But at the same time, it will also increase the structure of the flow in the water

1203
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Just make the water more chaotic

1204
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Then it leads to sedimentation, subsoil sedimentation, whirlpool

1205
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There is also an increase in the transmission rate of surface gas

1206
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In addition, we are based on different plant groups

1207
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The ratio of sedimentation and water flow interaction

1208
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The flow of this structure that produces different levels

1209
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We can propose a new physical model

1210
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Then consider the impact of aquatic plants

1211
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Then more precisely

1212
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
To predict the mechanism of subsoil sedimentation and surface gas transmission

1213
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then these information

1214
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We hope that in the future

1215
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It helps to assess more accurately

1216
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Ecology and the plan of aquatic engineering

1217
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
With this whole image

1218
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's 9.50 now

1219
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Generally speaking, the speech is about an hour

1220
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Is it?

1221
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes

1222
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OK, I should have a little time at the end

1223
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So I'll take this time

1224
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
To share some other interesting things

1225
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
During the PhD

1226
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In addition to the previously mentioned

1227
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Smaller aquatic plants

1228
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We are also using larger aquatic plants

1229
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Like this kind of aquatic plants to do experiments

1230
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Then we set the density to be higher

1231
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Then the number of more aquatic plants

1232
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
To explore the structure of the water flow and the problem of gas exchange at a larger scale

1233
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I hope that we can discuss

1234
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The physical model proposed by the previous small-density experiment

1235
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Is it the same

1236
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Suitable for larger environments

1237
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
After all, because our ultimate goal

1238
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is to apply this model

1239
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
To the real-world environment of rivers and lakes

1240
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Because we also know that experiments

1241
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Always simplify

1242
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The phenomenon of the whole natural world

1243
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So if you can make your scale bigger

1244
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Then make it closer to the natural world

1245
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It means that your model will be more convincing

1246
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes, of course, we also hope

1247
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Is that there can be some limited measurement data

1248
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Then compare it with the data we experimented

1249
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Then expand the range of the whole model

1250
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
To the scale of the real field

1251
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
In addition, we also found

1252
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Is that the position of the plant group

1253
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
In fact, it will also affect the whole

1254
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The transmission of geothermal sand and the evolution of the terrain

1255
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Like the image on the upper right

1256
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The pillar is randomly placed

1257
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Then the pillar at the bottom right is regular

1258
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Is what we call staggered

1259
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
This kind of regular placement

1260
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then we compare the two videos

1261
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It can be clearly found that

1262
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
When the pillar is randomly placed

1263
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The bottom bed will flow like a wave

1264
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's like a wave

1265
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But when the pillar is placed in a regular way

1266
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The bottom bed changes

1267
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But it doesn't evolve like the wave above

1268
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's just a layer of sand

1269
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It's just a continuous downward transmission

1270
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Then the other is the video on the left

1271
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It shows that the sand particles

1272
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Is that it follows

1273
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The flow structure produced by the plant in the water

1274
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There are different modes of movement

1275
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Like some of them

1276
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We can see that it is going down along the whole bottom bed

1277
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Some of them are what we call saltation

1278
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's a bouncing transmission

1279
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Then some of them are directly suspended

1280
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Then take it along the water

1281
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
In fact, these are all very interesting

1282
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
More basic physical problems

1283
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Some scientists are also discussing

1284
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Particles

1285
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
How is it in the fluid

1286
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
With the flow of different structures

1287
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
To move

1288
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
These basic problems

1289
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Then during my doctoral class

1290
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I was very lucky to participate

1291
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
In addition to aquatic plants

1292
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We also discussed

1293
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I just mentioned a question

1294
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
In addition to discussing plants

1295
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Also discuss the flow of water

1296
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
The impact of another aquatic plant

1297
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That is fish

1298
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So the origin of the whole plan

1299
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Let me introduce you a little bit

1300
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
The origin of the whole plan

1301
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Because of the West Coast of the United States

1302
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The current ecology

1303
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Is seriously affected by foreign species

1304
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That foreign species is Asian carp

1305
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Asian carp

1306
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Asian carp basically

1307
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Midwestern

1308
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There is no land

1309
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So they react very quickly

1310
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Then it will harm

1311
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Some local species

1312
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So some biologists in the United States

1313
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They want to try to use

1314
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Natural law

1315
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
To naturally reduce the reaction of Asian carp

1316
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Instead of just going straight

1317
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Because now

1318
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Basically advocate the so-called

1319
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Natural process

1320
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
On the way

1321
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Cooperate with biologists

1322
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
In the U.S. Geological Survey

1323
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Is to put real fish eggs

1324
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
To our aquatic plants

1325
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Then our aquatic plants

1326
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This time the aquatic plants are used

1327
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We call it Turbulence Tank

1328
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It is a

1329
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
About one meter by one meter

1330
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Then we can see

1331
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
There is an iron grid

1332
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Then there is a motor above

1333
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Can control the vibration of this grid

1334
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Then through this vibration

1335
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Different intensity of turbulence

1336
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Then we can see

1337
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
When I know different turbulence

1338
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
What is the survival rate of these fish eggs

1339
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Because we know

1340
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The stronger the turbulence

1341
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Basically speaking, the film of the fish egg

1342
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It is very likely to be destroyed

1343
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Basically their hatching rate will be lower

1344
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So we do this

1345
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Do this experiment

1346
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
To explore

1347
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
What is the survival rate

1348
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Based on different scales or different intensities

1349
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
This kind of turbulence

1350
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Then provide some biologists

1351
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Some insight to do some ecological work

1352
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Then we also set different structures

1353
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Like a stone

1354
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
To simulate the flow of different environmental water

1355
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Then we

1356
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The research here is for

1357
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Just hatched

1358
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Larvae

1359
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Then there is the fish egg that I just mentioned

1360
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Then look at

1361
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
When there is a stone and then there is a stream

1362
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
When it flows

1363
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
These larvae

1364
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
What kind of place do they like to stay

1365
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
From here

1366
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We can clearly see

1367
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
There are two large parts

1368
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
One part is at the top

1369
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The other part is behind the stone

1370
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Mainly because behind the stone

1371
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Basically it flows slower

1372
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So those larvae

1373
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
If you stay here

1374
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Will be safer

1375
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Then basically its survival rate will be higher

1376
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If it is higher

1377
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The place above

1378
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It basically flows straight down

1379
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But it is less

1380
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's just above the stone

1381
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Because here is basically

1382
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We just mentioned

1383
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Like the turbulence of Caton-Piscot

1384
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
In addition to the larvae

1385
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We also do adult fish

1386
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Do adult fish

1387
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Research on the reaction of different flow factors

1388
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
In the video

1389
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We set up a

1390
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just a bigger pillar

1391
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Then we can find that most of the time

1392
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
This fish

1393
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
He would prefer to stay behind this column

1394
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Can be broadcast again

1395
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Then we can see

1396
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
This fish will follow

1397
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Is the tail of our pillar

1398
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This tail

1399
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And then basically

1400
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's like this

1401
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It can save its swimming energy

1402
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Then

1403
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Basically what we are doing here

1404
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Are some more preliminary research

1405
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
In the future

1406
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Of course, more experiments are needed

1407
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
To do further research

1408
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Under various flow conditions

1409
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Beneficial to the environment of fish

1410
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then

1411
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
To better predict the ecology of fish

1412
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And development

1413
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
During my Ph.D.

1414
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I am more fortunate to participate in these

1415
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Quite interesting

1416
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Different

1417
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Biological-related topics

1418
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I think

1419
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The time should be almost

1420
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So

1421
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Thank you

1422
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
My advisor during my Ph.D.

1423
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Then there is my whole

1424
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Research group at UIUC

1425
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Then basically my funding is from

1426
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
My boss NSF's plan

1427
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Then there is Taiwan and UIUC

1428
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Joint fellowship

1429
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's the last

1430
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Q&A time

1431
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
See if you have any questions

1432
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Then I am also happy to

1433
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Share more

1434
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Information to everyone

1435
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
If you are

1436
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Environmental science or even ecology

1437
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
If you are interested in water resources

1438
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You are welcome to contact me

1439
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Ok then

1440
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That's it

1441
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh, before everyone

1442
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Before asking questions

1443
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Please turn on the microphone

1444
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Then we applaud again

1445
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Thank you for bringing us

1446
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Today's wonderful speech

1447
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Thank you

1448
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Ok

1449
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Then welcome everyone to ask questions

1450
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
You can directly turn on the microphone to ask questions

1451
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Or type in the chat

1452
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Or there is an icon next to it

1453
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Then

1454
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Let me ask a question first

1455
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I am for

1456
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Implement this model

1457
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You are a little curious

1458
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Just because

1459
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
After all, every river is different

1460
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Or you design an experiment

1461
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The size of his tank

1462
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Should be

1463
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I hope it will be much bigger than you

1464
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Implement this

1465
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Analytical model

1466
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So it will

1467
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Like a river

1468
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You won't make this thing

1469
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Small to

1470
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
H2O molecule

1471
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Then you mentioned in it

1472
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You will judge that there are plants here

1473
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
No plants here

1474
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
How far is the plant from the water

1475
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So I may not catch it

1476
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But my guess is

1477
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
This length scale

1478
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's probably the same as the plant

1479
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Is it about the same size?

1480
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Basically my scale

1481
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It should be a plant group

1482
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So it's not just a group

1483
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
A group of plants

1484
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So basically it should be

1485
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Because my experiment is basically

1486
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Your plant

1487
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There must be no way to implement

1488
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's as much as reality

1489
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It must be a

1490
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Limited situation

1491
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But it should be noted that

1492
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Because my tank is basically limited in size

1493
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So I can think of it as

1494
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
A scale dump

1495
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Physical model

1496
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So I'm on both sides here

1497
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Basically belong to a

1498
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Average scale

1499
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So you can think of it

1500
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
As a plant group

1501
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
For example

1502
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
This experiment

1503
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You can think of it as a

1504
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Very small river

1505
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And there are these plants in it

1506
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Like I just mentioned

1507
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
How can I make sure

1508
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm here

1509
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This thing

1510
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Can really be applied

1511
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
In fact, there is still a gap between this

1512
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Because

1513
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
In practice

1514
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It must be a simplified model

1515
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There are actually a lot of

1516
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Empirical parameters

1517
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But these parameters

1518
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
For us experimentalists

1519
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
This parameter is all inside

1520
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It means we

1521
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Physical based model

1522
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Because basically

1523
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Although my river is bigger

1524
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But it still follows the same

1525
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Fluid mechanics mechanism

1526
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But my empirical coefficient may be different

1527
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But I can make sure

1528
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
My model

1529
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
If it is based on this physics

1530
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Then my river will also

1531
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Follow this mechanism

1532
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So this is what I just mentioned

1533
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We hope to be able to do

1534
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Larger model

1535
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
How much is the difference between this

1536
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Empirical coefficient

1537
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
With my small river

1538
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Then if we have

1539
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Some limited measurements

1540
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
We can be more clear

1541
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
The curve of this empirical model

1542
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Then these things

1543
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Can actually be used as

1544
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A numerical simulation

1545
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because basically

1546
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
We have to do more

1547
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
There must be no way

1548
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So we have to rely on simulation

1549
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
There must be someone

1550
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Challenging

1551
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
How can you ensure

1552
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The result of my simulation

1553
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
With real experiments

1554
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Or the real environment is the same

1555
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So at this time

1556
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You have to rely on experimental validity

1557
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Then give it some useful parameters

1558
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let it do more

1559
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Prediction

1560
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Correct

1561
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know if I answered your question

1562
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Basically part of the answer

1563
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Answered my second question

1564
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
My first question is completely answered

1565
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
My next question is actually

1566
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
If you want to put your model today

1567
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Throw in a simulation

1568
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Then for example, I will

1569
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Simulate a river

1570
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Is there such a plan?

1571
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Which one is safer to do experiments?

1572
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You have a plan to take data

1573
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Then compare

1574
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Simulation

1575
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
My previous group is currently

1576
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
No

1577
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Because my previous group is basically

1578
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Mainly focused on aquaculture experiments

1579
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But we have

1580
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Other schools are talking about cooperation

1581
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Some other schools

1582
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Their group

1583
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Their strong point

1584
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Is doing limited survey

1585
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Then they may be near the school

1586
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
There is one

1587
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
There may be a similar type of river in the campus

1588
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Then they may

1589
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Use that river as a sample

1590
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Then go there to pick up points

1591
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Want to compare with our experiment

1592
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Then basically

1593
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Simulation now

1594
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Is already

1595
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's amazing to calculate

1596
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Complex

1597
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Fluid problem, but it still has a limit

1598
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I just talked about it

1599
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Completely

1600
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Copy the real situation

1601
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Especially aquaculture

1602
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
How do you put

1603
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Aquaculture

1604
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Implement to your model

1605
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So this is why

1606
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I just said that we can provide useful parameters

1607
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So basically

1608
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I just mentioned that aquaculture has two main

1609
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
One is to reduce flow

1610
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So it will provide a drag

1611
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Then that drag

1612
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I can give it a drag coefficient

1613
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Then the other one is that my aquaculture will produce a flow

1614
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
What about the flow

1615
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You can also give it another parameter

1616
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Then throw these two parameters

1617
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Into my numerical simulation

1618
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can go through

1619
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Actually

1620
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Build a grid

1621
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Build these vegetation

1622
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I can do parameterization

1623
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
To get close results

1624
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
This is the current

1625
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I know numerical model

1626
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
What they are doing

1627
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So they still need

1628
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This data we experimented

1629
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
To give them useful parameters

1630
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Then let them do simulation

1631
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I understand

1632
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I think it's very interesting

1633
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Do you have any other questions

1634
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I have a question

1635
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yes

1636
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Actually I'm curious

1637
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What you will do in

1638
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Aquaculture

1639
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Because you will

1640
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You will do numerical simulation in aquaculture

1641
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Related things

1642
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I should do simulation

1643
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yes

1644
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Then your simulation

1645
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Actually I have a follow-up

1646
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Previous question

1647
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You talked about

1648
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You are in the system

1649
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
You will have a

1650
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Similar

1651
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Basically you see yourself

1652
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Average scale

1653
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
In fact, many simulation methods

1654
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Will use multi-scale

1655
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You may have different

1656
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Dynamics

1657
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Dynamics

1658
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But you

1659
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
May look at the problem

1660
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't know

1661
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
In aquaculture

1662
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Multi-scale simulation

1663
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
How far

1664
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
This question is very good

1665
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I answer first

1666
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
What I want to do in aquaculture

1667
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Basically I should be in aquaculture

1668
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Do simulation

1669
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because there is a good

1670
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Calculation computation resources

1671
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But I may

1672
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Sorry

1673
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I may not continue

1674
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I should not continue to do experiments

1675
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because they seem to be there

1676
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
As far as I know, there is no experimental equipment

1677
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yes

1678
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
As for doing simulation

1679
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm not sure if I can do aquaculture simulation

1680
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm still

1681
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Because I just uploaded

1682
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So I still don't know

1683
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Not yet

1684
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Future topic

1685
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
But about you just mentioned

1686
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Multi-scale problem

1687
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Because basically I

1688
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I used to have similar experiences

1689
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
In fact, doing

1690
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Simulation of aquaculture

1691
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
A very important problem is that I just mentioned

1692
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Turbulence model

1693
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Because Turbulence is basically very small

1694
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So if I want to be precise

1695
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
To

1696
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I want to be precise to simulate this

1697
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Turbulence flow

1698
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
My grid must be thin enough

1699
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
The result of the physics I came out

1700
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Physics

1701
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Meaning

1702
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But there is a problem

1703
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
My grid must be very thin

1704
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But if I have to do like

1705
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Large-scale simulation

1706
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I can't have so much resources

1707
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Because I want to be very thin and I have to

1708
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Really big domain

1709
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Then my computation cost is very large

1710
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So

1711
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
They will do some of the parameters I just mentioned

1712
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Process

1713
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
When I have a small AD

1714
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
How will my AD affect the flow

1715
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Then it may affect its drag

1716
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It may affect the flow of energy

1717
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Then I use this

1718
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Parameterization to give

1719
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
To the large scale model

1720
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
To do simulation

1721
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Then I can skip the small scale simulation

1722
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Directly use large scale

1723
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Then you just talked about multi-scale

1724
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Now there is indeed

1725
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Because some people found out

1726
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I'll go back to a picture

1727
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I mentioned it earlier

1728
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I remember there is a picture

1729
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Is in

1730
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Wait a minute

1731
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Find it

1732
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
This

1733
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
OK this

1734
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We can see

1735
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I just mentioned

1736
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Most of the rivers

1737
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
The flow is at the bottom

1738
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Because the friction of the bottom bed

1739
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
This is produced by the gravity

1740
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So the flow here is very strong

1741
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Now the scientists have found

1742
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I just use the parameterization process

1743
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
To do the whole river

1744
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Simulation may have some errors

1745
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Because if they

1746
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Want to see more detailed things

1747
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
In the bottom part of the bed, they use large scale

1748
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Basically your grid is too thick

1749
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
The things you see

1750
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It must not be thin enough

1751
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
They are doing multi-scale

1752
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
They put the bottom bed

1753
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
The grid is very thin

1754
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Then I can solve it

1755
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Really solve this

1756
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The flow of air

1757
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But what about the grid above me

1758
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I know their flow is not strong

1759
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So they can directly use

1760
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Parameterization to transmit

1761
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So just do it

1762
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
To merge

1763
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
There is indeed such a

1764
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Simulation

1765
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
In fact, this can also be applied to the atmosphere

1766
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Because if you want to do the boundary layer

1767
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Is that I am far away

1768
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The atmosphere on the surface

1769
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Basically they are doing

1770
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Large AD Simulation

1771
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So they are not solving

1772
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
They are also a parameterization process

1773
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Then it's not really solving

1774
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Very close to the surface

1775
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But if they want to see

1776
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
For example, these urban buildings

1777
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
The shape of these currents

1778
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They may put

1779
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The grid inside is very thin

1780
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Then rely on parameters

1781
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
To transmit this information from the bottom bed

1782
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
From the bottom to the top

1783
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I don't know if I have answered your question

1784
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
But this question is very good

1785
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It is indeed the current scientists

1786
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Especially

1787
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
People doing application math

1788
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
What are you doing

1789
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Because they are good at doing some

1790
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Network grid

1791
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Network grid information

1792
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
There is no problem

1793
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know if anyone else has any questions

1794
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
If there is no problem

1795
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I am the host of today's speech

1796
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Let's talk a little bit

1797
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Is in the chat part

1798
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You can see that I just put it up
