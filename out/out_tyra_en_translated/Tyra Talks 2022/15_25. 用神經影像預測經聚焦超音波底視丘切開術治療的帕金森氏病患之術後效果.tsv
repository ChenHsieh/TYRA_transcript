100000	106000	If your phone cannot install the POAP app we use,
106000	108000	you can leave it after the presentation.
108000	110000	We will discuss how to solve it.
110000	112000	Let's get back to the topic.
112000	115000	Today's speaker is Lin Shujing.
115000	119000	Shujing completed her university and master's degree in Taiwan.
119000	122000	She studied medical imaging and brain science
122000	124000	at Zhongshan Medical School and Yangming University.
124000	126000	During her university days,
126000	129000	she trained as a clinical radiologist.
129000	130000	During her master's degree,
130000	135000	she studied fMRI analysis in the brain function group of Dr. Long.
135000	136000	During her master's degree,
136000	140000	she studied neuroscience at UBC University in Canada.
140000	141000	During her master's degree,
141000	144000	she studied the connection between functional neuroimaging
144000	148000	and the cognitive functions of neuropaths.
148000	151000	She focused on neural network analysis.
151000	154000	Currently, she is a research fellow
154000	159000	at Montreal Neurological Institute in Canada.
159000	162000	She is on a business trip in Germany.
162000	165000	Based on Chaira's tradition,
165000	167000	please turn on your microphone
167000	170000	and welcome the speaker.
170000	172000	Are you ready?
172000	175000	3, 2, 1.
178000	181000	Thank you for your cooperation.
182000	185000	I will stop sharing the screen.
185000	188000	The stage is yours, Shujing.
190000	191000	Thank you.
192000	193000	Hi, everyone.
193000	195000	I'm at the hotel in Munihae.
195000	198000	I hope the internet connection is stable.
198000	200000	I hope there won't be any problems.
200000	201000	If there are any problems,
201000	204000	I will try again later.
204000	207000	Please bear with me if there are any problems.
207000	208000	Okay.
208000	210000	Today, I'm going to talk about
210000	213000	neuroimaging.
213000	215000	What is neuroimaging?
215000	217000	What is neuroimaging?
217000	219000	What is neuroimaging?
219000	221000	What I'm going to talk about today
221000	224000	is a paper in MNI.
224000	229000	This paper was accepted
229000	232000	last year.
232000	236000	I will mainly talk about the main points.
236000	239000	I will also talk about some details.
239000	241000	I will put the reference in the end.
241000	243000	You can read it if you are interested.
243000	244000	Or we can discuss it later.
244000	246000	My title is a bit long.
247000	250000	Neuroimaging can predict
250000	257000	the effect of a patient's treatment.
257000	260000	Let's take a look at the topic.
266000	267000	It's a bit slow.
267000	269000	First, I will talk about
269000	273000	the general background information.
273000	275000	This is not related to
275000	277000	what I'm going to talk about today.
277000	279000	It's mainly for the general concept.
279000	282000	The main point is
282000	284000	what I'm going to talk about today
284000	286000	is an application.
286000	288000	It's an application using multivariant.
288000	291000	Why do we use multivariant
291000	293000	instead of univariant?
293000	297000	Univariant is a more traditional method.
297000	300000	It can indeed increase your statistical efficiency.
300000	305000	But it's too simple.
305000	308000	You can't know much about it.
308000	313000	There are many new evidences.
313000	315000	There are many different diseases.
315000	319000	Neuroimaging, neuroinflammatory,
319000	321000	and other diseases
321000	327000	are not caused by a single factor.
327000	329000	If you use univariant,
329000	333000	you can't see the other important details.
333000	337000	The advantage of using multivariant
337000	342000	is that you can see the multidimensional association.
342000	348000	You can find a comprehensive effect
348000	351000	instead of a single number or variable.
351000	355000	In this way, you can know more precisely
355000	359000	the relationship between your data and clinical trials.
359000	362000	The research I'm going to talk about
362000	365000	is mainly used in Parkinson's disease.
365000	368000	It's a clinical trial.
368000	371000	The main purpose is
371000	374000	to see if the baseline data
374000	379000	can predict the improvement
379000	384000	after the treatment.
384000	386000	This is our central idea.
386000	390000	Next, I'm going to talk about
390000	393000	the research I'm going to talk about.
393000	396000	First, I'm going to talk about
396000	398000	neuropsychology.
398000	400000	What is Parkinson's disease?
400000	405000	It's a disease related to action.
405000	408000	The main cause is
408000	412000	a neuroendocrine in the brain.
412000	414000	For some reason,
414000	418000	we can't tell you what the reason is.
418000	420000	For some reason,
420000	422000	the neuroendocrine gradually dies.
422000	424000	On the right,
424000	426000	in the normal human brain,
426000	428000	this place is called the substantia nigra.
428000	431000	There are many black cells,
431000	433000	the so-called dopamine neurons.
433000	435000	But in the patient,
435000	437000	the black cells are gone.
437000	439000	They become white.
439000	441000	These cells are dead.
441000	444000	They can't transfer the neuroendocrine
444000	446000	to other areas of the brain.
446000	450000	This will cause many clinical symptoms,
450000	452000	including exercise and non-exercise symptoms.
452000	454000	The so-called exercise symptoms
454000	456000	we often hear is resting tremor.
456000	457000	If the patient is sitting,
457000	459000	his hands will keep shaking.
459000	462000	Or non-exercise symptoms,
462000	464000	such as cognitive impairment,
464000	467000	or some patients have insomnia, etc.
468000	472000	Because it's not just a professional exercise symptom,
472000	474000	we say that
474000	479000	every patient is a little different.
479000	482000	So we say it's heterogeneous.
482000	484000	Everyone is different.
484000	488000	It's not just the so-called dopamine system that's affected.
488000	492000	Other neuroendocrine systems are also affected.
492000	496000	So we think this is also a so-called multifactorial disease.
496000	499000	It's not just a single factor that affects this disease.
500000	502000	The current treatment includes
502000	504000	the first and most common,
504000	506000	which is drug control.
506000	508000	Usually, this drug control
508000	512000	is quite good for most patients.
512000	514000	But for some, I don't know why,
514000	517000	they don't react well to this drug.
517000	519000	If this is the case,
519000	521000	we can consider another way,
521000	523000	called deep brain stimulation.
523000	526000	Deep brain stimulation is actually very invasive.
526000	529000	But for some patients,
529000	532000	it's a very effective treatment.
532000	534000	But it has one drawback,
534000	536000	which is that it's very invasive.
536000	540000	Neuroendocrine is actually buried in the brain.
540000	544000	This electrode connects to a battery.
544000	547000	The battery is placed in the patient's chest.
547000	549000	About every five years,
549000	551000	the battery in the chest needs to be replaced.
551000	553000	But it's very invasive.
553000	555000	Not every patient can do this kind of surgery.
555000	558000	So far, we have another way,
558000	560000	which is the one I'm going to talk about today.
560000	565000	I don't know what to do with it.
565000	567000	Because we usually call it
567000	569000	hard-focus ultrasound.
569000	571000	This method uses
571000	575000	precise positioning with the help of imaging
575000	578000	to see which area of the brain
578000	580000	needs to be stimulated.
580000	582000	The hard-focus ultrasound
582000	584000	is a similar way of surgery
584000	586000	to damage the brain tissue.
586000	588000	This will cause the brain to
588000	591000	change the connection of the brain circuit.
591000	593000	After the change,
593000	596000	it can improve some problems in the movement.
596000	599000	I saw the news a few weeks ago.
599000	601000	There is news like this in Taiwan.
601000	604000	It seems to be about MRI navigation
605000	607000	to teach ultrasound therapy.
607000	609000	It sounds terrible.
609000	611000	I will talk about the hard-focus ultrasound.
611000	613000	It's easier.
613000	615000	But the problem is,
615000	617000	although this method
617000	619000	can work well for many patients,
619000	621000	not everyone
621000	623000	can get the same result.
623000	625000	This is what we are still wondering about.
625000	627000	Why?
627000	629000	So we might think
629000	631000	it's because we need some predictions
631000	633000	before the treatment.
633000	635000	And these predictions
635000	637000	are not for the whole group,
637000	639000	but for each patient.
639000	641000	So we need to predict the result
641000	643000	to see if the patient
643000	645000	is suitable for the treatment.
645000	647000	Another important question is
647000	649000	we need to understand
649000	651000	what is the actual effect
651000	653000	of the ultrasound.
653000	655000	Although the treatment
655000	657000	is very effective so far,
657000	659000	we are still not 100% sure
659000	661000	how it works.
661000	663000	So this is also an important question.
663000	665000	Next,
665000	667000	let's talk about the main purpose of this research.
667000	669000	This is a simple way
669000	671000	to show
671000	673000	what we are doing.
673000	675000	I'm not sure
675000	677000	if I have a laser pointer.
677000	679000	Let me see.
679000	681000	Okay,
681000	683000	I have a laser pointer.
683000	685000	There are two main ways.
685000	687000	The first one
687000	689000	is to see
689000	691000	if we can use
691000	693000	the pre-treatment data
693000	695000	to predict the post-treatment results.
695000	697000	The second one
697000	699000	is to see
699000	701000	if the clinical results
701000	703000	after the treatment
703000	705000	can be explained
705000	707000	by the pre-treatment results.
707000	709000	Can the clinical results
709000	711000	be explained
711000	713000	by the pre-treatment results?
713000	715000	We mainly use
715000	717000	multimodal neural imaging
717000	719000	and clinical data
721000	723000	to see
723000	725000	if we can achieve
725000	727000	the two goals.
729000	731000	Let me briefly introduce
731000	733000	our patients.
733000	735000	There are only
735000	737000	35 patients
737000	739000	with Parkinson's disease.
739000	741000	These patients are monoclonal.
741000	743000	They are more affected.
743000	745000	Originally,
745000	747000	we planned to receive
747000	749000	at least 50 patients.
749000	751000	However,
751000	753000	this clinical trial
753000	755000	was conducted in Spain,
755000	757000	which is our partner.
757000	759000	However,
759000	761000	COVID-19 happened
761000	763000	halfway through
763000	765000	the clinical trial.
765000	767000	The Spanish side
767000	769000	seemed to be slightly interrupted.
769000	771000	Several patients
771000	773000	were unable to
773000	775000	enter the clinic.
775000	777000	These patients
777000	779000	are monoclonal.
779000	781000	They are treated
781000	783000	with focus ultrasound.
783000	785000	After the treatment,
785000	787000	after 24 hours,
787000	789000	MRI imaging is performed
789000	791000	to see
791000	793000	if the focus ultrasound
793000	795000	reaches the desired level.
795000	797000	The white arrow
797000	799000	is the so-called lesion.
799000	801000	It is the effect
801000	803000	of the focus ultrasound.
803000	805000	This is the so-called
805000	807000	subthalamic nucleon.
807000	809000	I did not see
809000	811000	the whole process.
811000	813000	However,
813000	815000	according to my lab boss,
815000	817000	the whole process
817000	819000	took a long time.
819000	821000	Let me take a sip of water.
831000	833000	The patient
833000	835000	was treated
835000	837000	with focus ultrasound.
837000	839000	After positioning,
839000	841000	the focus ultrasound
841000	843000	reached the brain area.
843000	845000	At the same time,
845000	847000	neurosurgeons
847000	849000	continued to
849000	851000	perform ultrasound
851000	853000	to see
853000	855000	if the patient's symptoms
855000	857000	had improved immediately.
857000	859000	At the same time,
859000	861000	neurosurgeons
861000	863000	checked the temperature
863000	865000	and the condition of the patient.
865000	867000	According to the patient's
867000	869000	immediate response,
869000	871000	if the patient's symptoms
871000	873000	had improved,
873000	875000	they would stop the ultrasound.
875000	877000	The whole process
877000	879000	took about 1-2 hours.
879000	881000	On the right,
881000	883000	we can see
883000	885000	the difference
885000	887000	between the two
887000	889000	types of motor symptoms.
889000	891000	These are the motor symptoms
891000	893000	assessed by neurosurgeons.
893000	895000	You can see
895000	897000	these four types
897000	899000	of motor symptoms.
899000	901000	They all improved
901000	903000	very well.
903000	905000	From baseline
905000	907000	to
907000	909000	our baseline,
909000	911000	the patient
911000	913000	was treated.
913000	915000	Three months later,
915000	917000	the patient was treated.
917000	919000	This is the fourth month.
919000	921000	You can see that
921000	923000	their treatment was very good.
923000	925000	The performance of the ultrasound
925000	927000	is good.
927000	929000	As for the actual method,
929000	931000	let's take a look at it
931000	933000	because there are too many details.
933000	935000	In short,
935000	937000	we use structural imaging
937000	939000	and functional imaging.
939000	941000	Structural imaging
941000	943000	refers to TY-weighted MRI imaging.
943000	945000	The first step is to
945000	947000	perform the imaging.
947000	949000	The imaging process
949000	951000	involves a lot of processing.
951000	953000	In the end,
953000	955000	what we need
955000	957000	are some numbers.
957000	959000	In functional imaging,
959000	961000	we need these two numbers,
961000	963000	F-alph and Re-alph.
963000	965000	F-alph refers to
965000	967000	the low fluctuation
967000	969000	in the racing set.
969000	971000	It's a bit like
971000	973000	the quantum number.
973000	975000	Re-alph refers to
975000	977000	the regional homogeneity.
977000	979000	It refers to how similar
979000	981000	the regions of the brain are.
981000	983000	In structural imaging,
983000	985000	what we need are
985000	987000	the gravimetric density and
987000	989000	the gravimetric atrophy,
989000	991000	which refers to
991000	993000	how much
993000	995000	the patient's
995000	997000	brain shrinkage
997000	999000	has shrunk.
999000	1001000	These are the four
1001000	1003000	different numbers,
1003000	1005000	and we put them
1005000	1007000	into our analysis.
1007000	1009000	This is our
1009000	1011000	multimodal neural imaging phenotype.
1011000	1013000	In statistical analysis,
1013000	1015000	we use
1015000	1017000	multivariate cross-correlation,
1017000	1019000	which is the same
1019000	1021000	as POS,
1021000	1023000	partial least square.
1023000	1025000	In this way,
1025000	1027000	we can see
1027000	1029000	the relationship
1029000	1031000	between two different data.
1031000	1033000	In this experiment,
1033000	1035000	the two different data
1035000	1037000	refer to images,
1037000	1039000	which are the features
1039000	1041000	of the brain.
1041000	1043000	The other data
1043000	1045000	refers to how much
1045000	1047000	the patients have improved.
1047000	1049000	This is a simple graph.
1049000	1051000	If you're not familiar with
1051000	1053000	POS,
1053000	1055000	this is a simple graph
1055000	1057000	of X and Y.
1057000	1059000	The purpose of POS
1059000	1061000	is to find the
1061000	1063000	X times A1.
1063000	1065000	A1 refers to
1065000	1067000	the weighting of X.
1067000	1069000	We find the
1069000	1071000	X1 times A1
1071000	1073000	plus X2 times A2,
1073000	1075000	and so on.
1075000	1077000	We find the linear combination
1077000	1079000	and the linear combination of Y.
1079000	1081000	These two combinations
1081000	1083000	are closely related to each other.
1083000	1085000	They are maximally co-variated.
1085000	1087000	In this way,
1087000	1089000	POS will think
1089000	1091000	that this is the pattern
1091000	1093000	that we observe.
1093000	1095000	This is the relationship
1095000	1097000	between the two features.
1097000	1099000	In addition,
1099000	1101000	we will do a lot of
1101000	1103000	statistical methods
1103000	1105000	to determine
1105000	1107000	what we observe
1107000	1109000	is meaningful in statistics,
1109000	1111000	including permutations and boosts.
1111000	1113000	The purpose of boosts
1113000	1115000	is to see
1115000	1117000	which variables
1117000	1119000	are important
1119000	1121000	and which are not.
1121000	1123000	These variables
1123000	1125000	are brain areas
1125000	1127000	or clinical data.
1127000	1129000	We need to see
1129000	1131000	which variables
1131000	1133000	are important
1133000	1135000	and which are not.
1135000	1137000	This is another graph.
1137000	1139000	It's a bit like
1139000	1141000	a simple
1141000	1143000	progress bar.
1143000	1145000	In this progress bar,
1145000	1147000	we have FMI and T1,
1147000	1149000	which are functional and structural data.
1149000	1151000	In terms of clinical data,
1151000	1153000	we calculate
1153000	1155000	how much
1155000	1157000	the baseline and month for
1157000	1159000	have increased or improved.
1159000	1161000	The first analysis
1161000	1163000	is to use
1163000	1165000	two sets of variables.
1165000	1167000	The first set
1167000	1169000	is imaging
1169000	1171000	and the second set is clinical improvement.
1171000	1173000	In the process,
1173000	1175000	we will also put
1175000	1177000	covariables,
1177000	1179000	such as age, gender,
1179000	1181000	and how long the patient has been sick.
1181000	1183000	We will remove
1183000	1185000	these covariables
1185000	1187000	in a linear way,
1187000	1189000	so that we don't have to
1189000	1191000	worry about these factors
1191000	1193000	when we look at the results.
1193000	1195000	The second analysis
1195000	1197000	is to see the difference
1197000	1199000	between baseline and month for,
1199000	1201000	not just baseline or month for.
1201000	1203000	It's to see the difference between them.
1203000	1205000	The other set of data
1205000	1207000	is clinical improvement.
1207000	1209000	We also put
1209000	1211000	some covariables in here.
1211000	1213000	Next,
1213000	1215000	we will look at the results.
1215000	1217000	The main results
1217000	1219000	are shown on the right.
1219000	1221000	The main result
1221000	1223000	is to see
1223000	1225000	the X-weighting
1225000	1227000	and Y-weighting.
1227000	1229000	The bigger the X-weighting,
1229000	1231000	the more important
1231000	1233000	the Y-weighting is
1233000	1235000	to the patient.
1235000	1237000	If we look back at the results,
1237000	1239000	these bars
1239000	1241000	are the weightings
1241000	1243000	we just saw.
1243000	1245000	This is the simplest way
1245000	1247000	to show
1247000	1249000	the results.
1249000	1251000	This is the clinical data,
1251000	1253000	and this is the imaging data.
1253000	1255000	How do we interpret this?
1255000	1257000	You have to look at the bars.
1257000	1259000	If they are
1259000	1261000	all positive,
1261000	1263000	you can see
1263000	1265000	that the bars
1265000	1267000	are positive.
1267000	1269000	The bars are positive.
1269000	1271000	If the bars
1271000	1273000	on the positive side
1273000	1275000	are on the negative side,
1275000	1277000	the bars on the negative side
1277000	1279000	are on the positive side.
1279000	1281000	The bars on the positive side
1281000	1283000	are more.
1283000	1285000	The bars on the negative side
1285000	1287000	are increasing.
1287000	1289000	The bars on the negative side
1289000	1291000	are decreasing.
1291000	1293000	Of course,
1293000	1295000	we don't put this on paper
1295000	1297000	when we write paper
1297000	1299000	to make it more beautiful.
1299000	1301000	This is another picture.
1301000	1303000	In addition to the
1303000	1305000	positive and negative
1305000	1307000	bars,
1307000	1309000	the left upper corner
1309000	1311000	also tells you
1311000	1313000	how much
1313000	1315000	the image
1315000	1317000	is related to
1317000	1319000	clinical data.
1319000	1321000	In short,
1321000	1323000	about 82%
1323000	1325000	of the data
1325000	1327000	can be interpreted.
1327000	1329000	This is quite high.
1329000	1331000	It means that
1331000	1333000	what we see
1333000	1335000	can represent our data.
1335000	1337000	When we do
1337000	1339000	permutation,
1339000	1341000	this is the result of permutation.
1341000	1343000	It also means that
1343000	1345000	it is related to statistics.
1345000	1347000	These are the improvements.
1347000	1349000	There are comprehensive
1349000	1351000	motor improvements,
1351000	1353000	or rigidity,
1353000	1355000	or tremor,
1355000	1357000	which are specialized improvements.
1357000	1359000	In short,
1359000	1361000	these improvements are related to
1361000	1363000	imaging.
1363000	1365000	These two pictures
1365000	1367000	are structural.
1367000	1369000	They include
1369000	1371000	small brain,
1371000	1373000	superior parietal lobe,
1373000	1375000	or deep brain.
1375000	1377000	This is grammatical density.
1377000	1379000	It is also seen in
1379000	1381000	superior parietal lobe,
1381000	1383000	pecuniary parietal lobe,
1383000	1385000	and small brain.
1385000	1387000	So,
1387000	1389000	what we see after
1389000	1391000	clinical treatment
1391000	1393000	is that
1393000	1395000	these improvements
1395000	1397000	are related to
1397000	1399000	these brain areas,
1399000	1401000	not just single brain areas.
1401000	1403000	The second result
1403000	1405000	is that
1405000	1407000	we use the difference
1407000	1409000	between baseline
1409000	1411000	and month 4
1411000	1413000	as our
1413000	1415000	imaging data.
1415000	1417000	The same is true
1417000	1419000	for the two groups
1419000	1421000	of the same image.
1421000	1423000	The two images
1423000	1425000	are related to each other.
1425000	1427000	We draw the same picture
1427000	1429000	in this way.
1429000	1431000	We see that
1431000	1433000	90% of the data
1433000	1435000	is explained
1435000	1437000	in this way.
1437000	1439000	This is also quite high.
1439000	1441000	We also see that
1441000	1443000	these clinical improvements
1443000	1445000	are related to many brain areas.
1445000	1447000	In terms of functional brain areas,
1447000	1449000	we also see some
1449000	1451000	in frontal lobe,
1451000	1453000	paracentral,
1453000	1455000	precuneus,
1455000	1457000	hippocampus,
1457000	1459000	and temporal lobe.
1459000	1461000	In terms of functional
1461000	1463000	brain areas,
1463000	1465000	we also see many
1465000	1467000	brain areas,
1467000	1469000	including small brain,
1469000	1471000	C-section,
1471000	1473000	and even in
1473000	1475000	precuneus.
1475000	1477000	We can also say that
1477000	1479000	the effect of this treatment
1479000	1481000	is not limited to single brain areas,
1481000	1483000	but many different brain areas.
1483000	1485000	In particular,
1485000	1487000	there are many small brain areas.
1487000	1489000	At the beginning,
1489000	1491000	we were surprised
1491000	1493000	that there are so many
1493000	1495000	small brain areas.
1495000	1497000	Later on,
1497000	1499000	we found a way
1499000	1501000	to explain it.
1501000	1503000	Later on,
1503000	1505000	we found a way
1505000	1507000	to explain it.
1507000	1509000	First of all,
1509000	1511000	we can use baseline
1511000	1513000	to predict the effect
1513000	1515000	after the treatment.
1515000	1517000	In other words,
1517000	1519000	when the patient's
1519000	1521000	post-treatment effect is greater,
1521000	1523000	the number of brain areas
1523000	1525000	will be relatively higher.
1525000	1527000	In other words,
1527000	1529000	patients with
1529000	1531000	strong treatment effect
1531000	1533000	may show
1533000	1535000	more atrophy.
1535000	1537000	may show more atrophy.
1537000	1539000	In other words,
1539000	1541000	the patient's brain
1541000	1543000	shrink more,
1543000	1545000	and less gravitational
1545000	1547000	density.
1547000	1549000	In other words,
1549000	1551000	the patient's brain
1551000	1553000	shrink more,
1553000	1555000	and less gravitational
1555000	1557000	density.
1557000	1559000	In addition,
1559000	1561000	the patient's brain
1561000	1563000	is not in single-brain area,
1563000	1565000	but in many different areas.
1565000	1567000	In conclusion,
1567000	1569000	if the patient's
1569000	1571000	MRI
1571000	1573000	shows
1573000	1575000	severe atrophy,
1575000	1577000	the treatment
1577000	1579000	may be better.
1579000	1581000	In other words,
1581000	1583000	ultrasound treatment
1583000	1585000	can be used on severe patients.
1585000	1587000	The second part
1587000	1589000	is the difference
1589000	1591000	between the baseline
1591000	1593000	and the pre-treatment patients
1595000	1597000	As we can see in this way,
1599000	1601000	many posterior brain areas
1601000	1603000	appear on the MRI.
1605000	1606000	This yes
1606000	1608000	depends on the function
1608000	1609000	and the structure of patients.
1609000	1611000	This depends on the function
1611000	1613000	and the structure of patients.
1613000	1615000	These posterior brains
1615000	1617000	although the patient's
1617000	1619000	target is in the subthalamus
1619000	1621000	although the patient's target is in the subthalamus
1621000	1623000	in that brain area,
1623000	1625000	the effect of the treatment
1625000	1627000	is spread out in that area
1627000	1629000	to the frontal,
1629000	1631000	to the parietal,
1631000	1633000	and to the cerebellum.
1633000	1635000	There is an important link
1635000	1637000	from the midbrain
1637000	1639000	from the midbrain
1639000	1641000	to the cerebellum.
1641000	1643000	to the cerebellum.
1643000	1645000	to the cerebellum.
1645000	1647000	There is a long white line
1647000	1649000	in the middle.
1649000	1651000	There is a long white line
1651000	1653000	in the middle.
1653000	1655000	The brain connects
1655000	1657000	the brain areas.
1657000	1659000	The effect of the treatment
1659000	1661000	is spread out from the midbrain
1661000	1663000	is spread out from the midbrain
1663000	1665000	like a telephone line,
1665000	1667000	to the parietal.
1667000	1669000	to the parietal.
1669000	1671000	to the parietal.
1701000	1703000	It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain
1703000	1705000	to the head
1705000	1707000	to the brain
1707000	1709000	to the brain
1709000	1711000	It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain
1711000	1713000	to the head
1713000	1715080	so we can see a significant change
1715080	1717000	in the brain
1717000	1719000	so we can see a significant change
1719000	1721000	and the brain becomes an important indicator.
1723000	1725000	We done this a year
1725000	1727000	and I'd like to know
1727000	1729000	which type of patient
1729000	1731000	we should focus on
1731000	1733000	but
1733000	1735000	how can we do more?
1735000	1737000	how can we do more?
1737000	1739000	I mean
1739000	1741000	how can we
1741000	1743000	push the current
1743000	1745000	Parkinson's treatment
1745000	1747000	to a single patient
1747000	1749000	to a single patient
1749000	1751000	I mean how can we
1751000	1753000	push the current treatment
1753000	1755000	to a personalized level
1755000	1757000	There are many ways we can do
1757000	1759000	not just group-wise
1759000	1761000	not just group-wise
1761000	1763000	say, he is sick
1763000	1765000	then we can do that
1765000	1767000	and if he is not
1767000	1769000	then we can do another way
1769000	1771000	or if he is this type of patient
1771000	1773000	then we can do that
1773000	1775000	because there are many patients
1775000	1777000	who can't do it
1777000	1779000	who can't do it
1779000	1781000	so we need to
1781000	1783000	design the treatment
1783000	1785000	for those patients
1785000	1787000	another thing we can do is
1787000	1789000	before clinical trial
1789000	1791000	before clinical trial
1791000	1793000	we carefully select the patient
1793000	1795000	some patients are suitable
1795000	1797000	some patients are not
1797000	1799000	this is also a way
1799000	1801000	or we can build a lot
1801000	1803000	in a mathematical or engineering way
1803000	1805000	to build the so-called brand model
1805000	1807000	to use these models to predict
1807000	1809000	the after-effects
1809000	1811000	we can also do
1811000	1813000	the so-called disease subtyping
1813000	1815000	that is, patients are not all the same
1815000	1817000	there may be many different subtypes
1817000	1819000	and different subtypes
1819000	1821000	may be suitable for different treatments
1821000	1823000	and so on
1823000	1825000	so
1825000	1827000	let me talk about business
1827000	1829000	our lab
1829000	1831000	is currently doing the so-called
1831000	1833000	precision medicine
1833000	1835000	especially in neuroendocrine
1835000	1837000	the lab also developed
1837000	1839000	a NeuroPM Bot
1839000	1841000	its purpose is to let you do
1841000	1843000	a lot of different analysis
1843000	1845000	this is the main
1845000	1847000	a little bit like you
1847000	1849000	open this toolbox
1849000	1851000	and see what it looks like
1851000	1853000	our toolbox can actually
1853000	1855000	use a lot of different data
1855000	1857000	not just the image
1857000	1859000	in addition to the image
1859000	1861000	of course you can also
1861000	1863000	use clinical data
1863000	1865000	cognitive function detection
1865000	1867000	or blood or gene
1867000	1869000	and so on
1869000	1871000	this interface
1871000	1873000	our toolbox
1873000	1875000	can be used for visualization
1875000	1877000	it can see which brainstem
1877000	1879000	is important
1879000	1881000	and then
1881000	1883000	this is a flowchart in paper
1883000	1885000	see what you need today
1885000	1887000	if you want to do
1887000	1889000	disease subtyping today
1889000	1891000	you can use this module
1891000	1893000	this is called CTI
1893000	1895000	if you want to do other parts
1895000	1897000	you can go here
1897000	1899000	if you have multi-modal imaging
1899000	1901000	you can do other things
1901000	1903000	if you only have a single image
1903000	1905000	there are so many kinds
1905000	1907000	you can use ESM
1907000	1909000	ESM is mainly
1909000	1911000	look at where the disease
1911000	1913000	starts in your brain
1913000	1915000	to find the source of the disease
1915000	1917000	the other one is to see
1917000	1919000	the relationship between different modalities
1919000	1921000	or
1921000	1923000	on this side
1923000	1925000	the so-called fingerprint
1925000	1927000	you can see
1927000	1929000	if you want to
1929000	1931000	visualize a patient
1931000	1933000	how much effort
1933000	1935000	does it take
1935000	1937000	to restore a patient's brain
1937000	1939000	this kind of information
1939000	1941000	is more effective
1941000	1943000	in developing design
1943000	1945000	I personally
1945000	1947000	have more experience
1947000	1949000	in this part
1949000	1951000	other people in our lab
1951000	1953000	have more experience
1953000	1955000	this is my lab code
1955000	1957000	you can download it
1957000	1959000	on the lab website
1959000	1961000	CTI is mainly
1961000	1963000	disease subtyping
1963000	1965000	and disease staging
1965000	1967000	if you have a lot of patients
1967000	1969000	let's say
1969000	1971000	Parkinson's disease
1971000	1973000	we can find
1973000	1975000	these three
1975000	1977000	if there are three different
1977000	1979000	we can find these three
1979000	1981000	at the same time
1981000	1983000	we can see
1983000	1985000	if this patient is
1985000	1987000	the most like a normal person
1987000	1989000	he is not so sick
1989000	1991000	so the color is light
1991000	1993000	or he is already
1993000	1995000	very serious
1995000	1997000	that is more red
1997000	1999000	so we call it
1999000	2001000	pseudotype
2001000	2003000	if you use imaging
2003000	2005000	how serious is the disease
2005000	2007000	we call
2007000	2009000	estimated disease severity
2009000	2011000	this is the result
2011000	2013000	in the paper
2013000	2015000	let's say there are a lot of normal people
2015000	2017000	Alzheimer's disease
2017000	2019000	and Huntington's disease
2019000	2021000	we use CTI to
2021000	2023000	classify them
2023000	2025000	they have their own
2025000	2027000	trajectory
2027000	2029000	Alzheimer's disease
2029000	2031000	their estimated disease severity
2031000	2033000	which is pseudotype
2033000	2035000	is very similar to
2035000	2037000	clinical indicators
2037000	2039000	and Huntington's disease
2039000	2041000	is related to their disease stage
2041000	2043000	so we get these pseudotypes
2043000	2045000	actually it is quite meaningful
2045000	2047000	finally
2047000	2049000	this should be the last
2049000	2051000	sharing time
2051000	2053000	we are currently preparing a
2053000	2055000	workshop
2055000	2057000	the time will be in spring or summer
2057000	2059000	we haven't decided
2059000	2061000	the location will be at Montreal Neurological Institute
2061000	2063000	if you are interested in
2063000	2065000	coming to Montreal, you can try it
2065000	2067000	there will be two days
2067000	2069000	the first day will be
2069000	2071000	I-GET-TALK
2071000	2073000	there will be students
2073000	2075000	or postdoc session
2075000	2077000	the second day will be
2077000	2079000	hands-on workshop
2079000	2081000	we will introduce
2081000	2083000	how to use NeuroPM toolbox
2083000	2085000	or other precision medicine
2085000	2087000	toolbox
2087000	2089000	we will ask people to
2089000	2091000	introduce to you
2091000	2093000	we haven't decided
2093000	2095000	the time or the content
2095000	2097000	but if there is any news
2097000	2099000	we will put it on the lab website
2099000	2101000	roughly
2101000	2103000	this is
2103000	2105000	what we are going to talk about
2105000	2107000	the paper on
2107000	2109000	focus ultrasound treatment
2109000	2111000	if you are interested
2111000	2113000	you can read it
2113000	2115000	I have saved a lot of details
2115000	2117000	this is the paper on
2117000	2119000	toolbox
2119000	2121000	there is a manual
2121000	2123000	this is the funding agency
2123000	2125000	thank you
2125000	2127000	any questions?
2131000	2133000	thank you
2135000	2137000	someone
2137000	2139000	want to ask a question
2139000	2141000	yes
2141000	2143000	me
2143000	2145000	ok
2145000	2147000	hello
2147000	2149000	I am Charlene
2149000	2151000	I want to ask
2151000	2153000	when you use ultrasound
2153000	2155000	to treat your brain
2155000	2157000	will the
2157000	2159000	dopamine
2159000	2161000	in your brain
2161000	2163000	recover?
2167000	2169000	frankly
2169000	2171000	no
2171000	2173000	we have
2173000	2175000	clinical trial
2175000	2177000	for a long time
2177000	2179000	I haven't seen
2179000	2181000	the latest data
2181000	2183000	but
2183000	2185000	according to clinical trial
2185000	2187000	I can tell you
2187000	2189000	there is no such thing
2189000	2191000	but the purpose of ultrasound
2191000	2193000	is to
2193000	2195000	cut off
2195000	2197000	the brain
2197000	2199000	and make a lesion
2199000	2201000	the whole
2201000	2203000	dopamine
2203000	2205000	recovery
2205000	2207000	the whole loop
2207000	2209000	will be cut off
2209000	2211000	it will
2211000	2213000	improve
2213000	2215000	the whole process of
2215000	2217000	dopamine transmission
2217000	2219000	in theory
2219000	2221000	we can't see
2221000	2223000	the regeneration of dopamine
2223000	2225000	but we can
2225000	2227000	change the way
2227000	2229000	dopamine is transmitted
2229000	2231000	in the brain
2231000	2233000	in a physical way
2233000	2235000	ok
2235000	2237000	thank you
2237000	2239000	thank you
2243000	2245000	I want to ask
2245000	2247000	the time and strength of
2247000	2249000	ultrasound
2249000	2251000	should be considered
2251000	2253000	yes
2253000	2255000	that's right
2255000	2257000	I haven't been to
2257000	2259000	Spain
2259000	2261000	to see their actual operation
2261000	2263000	but I know
2263000	2265000	neurosurgeons are
2265000	2267000	well-prepared
2267000	2269000	to keep positioning
2269000	2271000	and test other
2271000	2273000	well-known data
2273000	2275000	indeed
2275000	2277000	the strength
2277000	2279000	must be strictly monitored
2279000	2281000	the treatment time
2281000	2283000	depends on the patient
2283000	2285000	so
2285000	2287000	from the beginning to the end
2287000	2289000	the strength and time
2289000	2291000	depends on the patient
2291000	2293000	they will move their hands
2293000	2295000	like this
2295000	2297000	to see if the motor
2297000	2299000	has improved
2299000	2301000	if they find
2301000	2303000	the motor has improved
2303000	2305000	they can stop
2305000	2307000	the ultrasound
2309000	2311000	I've seen
2311000	2313000	other papers
2313000	2315000	like
2315000	2317000	to see if the data
2317000	2319000	for example
2319000	2321000	the temperature of
2321000	2323000	the brain
2323000	2325000	will rise
2325000	2327000	to what degree
2327000	2329000	is safe
2329000	2331000	how strong
2331000	2333000	and so on
2333000	2335000	if
2335000	2337000	we want to
2337000	2339000	apply the results
2339000	2341000	to the clinical trial
2341000	2343000	we will discuss with
2343000	2345000	neurosurgeons
2345000	2347000	to see if
2347000	2349000	we can
2349000	2351000	apply the results
2351000	2353000	to the clinical trial
2353000	2355000	we do have
2355000	2357000	a plan like this
2357000	2359000	but we haven't started
2359000	2361000	yet
2361000	2363000	Thank you
2363000	2365000	I also have a question
2365000	2367000	outside the door
2367000	2369000	you mentioned
2369000	2371000	a lot of treatment
2371000	2373000	I'm wondering
2373000	2375000	if quantified
2375000	2377000	has side effects
2377000	2379000	yes
2379000	2381000	usually
2381000	2383000	after the treatment
2383000	2385000	within 24 hours
2385000	2387000	they scan the MRI
2387000	2389000	to see the lesion
2389000	2391000	the picture I showed
2391000	2393000	in the slide
2393000	2395000	and also to see
2395000	2397000	if there are any other
2397000	2399000	complications
2399000	2401000	in the brain
2401000	2403000	after 24 hours
2403000	2405000	the patient will come back
2405000	2407000	for follow-up
2407000	2409000	they will
2409000	2411000	based on the clinical trial
2411000	2413000	called UBDRS
2413000	2415000	to assess
2415000	2417000	the whole process
2417000	2419000	to see if it is good
2419000	2421000	and other
2421000	2423000	quality of life
2423000	2425000	to see if there are
2425000	2427000	other complications
2427000	2429000	indeed
2429000	2431000	there are
2431000	2433000	two patients
2433000	2435000	were removed
2435000	2437000	due to complications
2437000	2439000	one of them
2439000	2441000	should be
2441000	2443000	better
2443000	2445000	but worse
2445000	2447000	so
2447000	2449000	we need to discuss
2449000	2451000	why
2451000	2453000	they did
2453000	2455000	a series of
2455000	2457000	assessments
2457000	2459000	the general question
2459000	2461000	is about
2461000	2463000	your background
2463000	2465000	why did you
2465000	2467000	switch from medical imaging
2467000	2469000	to neuroscience
2469000	2471000	I was
2471000	2473000	interested in
2473000	2475000	imaging
2475000	2477000	especially brain imaging
2477000	2479000	when I was
2479000	2481000	an intern
2481000	2483000	I was an intern
2483000	2485000	in clinical trial
2485000	2487000	at that time
2487000	2489000	we had our first
2489000	2491000	research institute
2491000	2493000	we wanted to
2493000	2495000	apply the imaging
2495000	2497000	in clinical trial
2497000	2499000	to
2499000	2501000	neuropsychiatry
2501000	2503000	not just
2503000	2505000	X-ray
2505000	2507000	I was interested
2507000	2509000	and I read
2509000	2511000	a lot of books
2511000	2513000	when I was
2513000	2515000	an intern
2515000	2517000	I wanted to
2517000	2519000	apply MRI
2519000	2521000	to patients
2521000	2523000	with mental
2523000	2525000	or neuropsychiatric
2525000	2527000	diseases
2527000	2529000	but
2529000	2531000	due to other reasons
2531000	2533000	I chose
2533000	2535000	FMRI
2535000	2537000	although
2537000	2539000	I did other
2539000	2541000	experiments
2541000	2543000	first
2543000	2545000	I wanted to do it
2545000	2547000	and second
2547000	2549000	I could only apply to
2549000	2551000	neuroscience
2551000	2553000	in Taiwan
2553000	2555000	many students
2555000	2557000	apply to
2557000	2559000	radiology
2559000	2561000	medical physics
2561000	2563000	but
2563000	2565000	there is no
2565000	2567000	radiology
2567000	2569000	in Taiwan
2569000	2571000	thank you
2571000	2573000	for your answer
2573000	2575000	do you have
2575000	2577000	other questions?
2581000	2583000	if not
2583000	2585000	I will
2585000	2587000	ask another question
2587000	2589000	thank you
2589000	2591000	for your speech
2591000	2593000	I am not a
2593000	2595000	neuroscientist
2595000	2597000	I am curious
2597000	2599000	what do you think
2599000	2601000	is the most difficult
2601000	2603000	part of this research?
2603000	2605000	collecting patient's data
2605000	2607000	or marking
2607000	2609000	brain areas
2609000	2611000	which part
2611000	2613000	do you think is the most difficult?
2613000	2615000	I think the most difficult
2615000	2617000	is how to
2617000	2619000	write the result
2619000	2621000	clearly
2621000	2623000	so that patients
2623000	2625000	can see it
2625000	2627000	it is hard
2627000	2629000	but I am not collecting data
2629000	2631000	we are collecting data
2631000	2633000	I know they spent a lot of time and effort
2633000	2635000	but
2635000	2637000	for me
2637000	2639000	the most difficult part is
2639000	2641000	when we see the result
2641000	2643000	how do we
2643000	2645000	calculate the weighting
2645000	2647000	we see in PRS
2647000	2649000	we say weighting is important
2649000	2651000	but if you tell a neuroscientist
2651000	2653000	I see this weighting
2653000	2655000	he will think
2655000	2657000	you think it is useful
2657000	2659000	but I don't think so
2659000	2661000	I want to know
2661000	2663000	how to treat patients
2663000	2665000	so we spent a lot of time
2665000	2667000	thinking
2667000	2669000	how to write the result
2669000	2671000	clearly
2671000	2673000	in a language
2673000	2675000	that is suitable for
2675000	2677000	clinical doctors
2677000	2679000	so that they can know
2679000	2681000	the result is effective
2681000	2683000	for me
2683000	2685000	the most difficult part
2685000	2687000	is when we explain
2687000	2689000	these variables
2689000	2691000	the relation between positive and negative
2691000	2693000	is very complicated
2693000	2695000	we need to
2695000	2697000	write it in several layers
2697000	2699000	the first layer
2699000	2701000	is to explain the result
2701000	2703000	positive or negative
2703000	2705000	the second layer
2705000	2707000	is to write
2707000	2709000	because it represents
2709000	2711000	the physiological meaning
2711000	2713000	in this process
2713000	2715000	we spent a lot of time
2715000	2717000	but luckily
2717000	2719000	when the paper was sent
2719000	2721000	the feedback
2721000	2723000	was good
2723000	2725000	most people understood
2725000	2727000	so we took a deep breath
2727000	2729000	that sounds really good
2729000	2731000	thank you
2731000	2733000	it was special
2733000	2735000	because I studied English
2735000	2737000	so we never
2737000	2739000	have the same field
2739000	2741000	but you have
2741000	2743000	clinical and academic
2743000	2745000	you need to communicate
2745000	2747000	like engineers
2747000	2749000	and physicists
2749000	2751000	you need to communicate
2751000	2753000	thank you
2753000	2755000	do you have other questions?
2757000	2759000	countdown

2765000	2767000	thank you
2767000	2769000	for your participation
2769000	2771000	thank you again
2771000	2773000	thank you
2773000	2775000	Sujin
2775000	2777000	thank you
2777000	2779000	we have
2779000	2781000	a questionnaire
2781000	2783000	I will turn off the recording
