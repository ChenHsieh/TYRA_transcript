0	13000	Hello everyone, I am Jason, and I am the host of Taira Talk. Welcome everyone to Taira Talk on April 19th.
13000	20000	The speaker we invited today is Dr. Zhan Yaojia.
20000	26000	He is currently a PhD candidate at UC Irvine.
26000	39000	His main work is in telecommunications and network information information theory.
39000	49000	He used to study and work at NTU Electronics and Telecommunications.
49000	59000	He is now a PhD student at UC Irvine, and will study abroad under the auspices of the Ministry of Education.
60000	63000	The topic of his talk today is
63000	72000	The impact of information technology on wireless network transmission.
72000	85000	Let's give the speaker a round of applause.
90000	95000	Let's give the floor to Yaojia.
95000	97000	Can you hear me?
97000	99000	Yes.
99000	103000	Okay, let's get started.
103000	105000	In fact, this is channel information.
105000	110000	Channel information refers to wireless transmission.
110000	118000	If I know in advance that the transmission is good or bad,
118000	120000	or if I can even quantify it,
120000	124000	I can make some configurations in advance in the transmission section.
124000	127000	This will further improve the efficiency of my transmission.
127000	132000	But if today's information is not so accurate,
132000	136000	what impact will it have on my transmission efficiency?
136000	139000	I hope I can get to this point.
139000	144000	I know some people today,
144000	147000	and they may all have a background in telecommunications.
147000	151000	But most of them are not our peers,
151000	155000	so I'll see how much I can say.
155000	157000	Okay, good.
157000	160000	Today I will mainly talk about these three parts.
160000	163000	The first part is that I will first review
163000	168000	how we do information transmission
168000	173000	when we are in the so-called traffic jam.
173000	176000	Of course, we have some basic restrictions.
176000	180000	For example, I hope that the higher the efficiency of my transmission,
180000	181000	the faster the speed,
181000	184000	but at the same time I can't let the transmission go wrong.
184000	186000	So what should I do?
186000	188000	In fact, in 1948,
188000	191000	Claude Shannon had already answered this question.
191000	196000	He had some good results,
196000	198000	which we will introduce.
198000	201000	The second part is that I will briefly introduce
201000	204000	some simple networks,
204000	208000	such as broadcast networks,
208000	210000	such as interference networks,
210000	212000	and interference channels.
212000	217000	They have some current solutions
217000	219000	for this kind of transmission problem,
219000	221000	and some problems have been solved,
221000	223000	and some problems have not been solved.
223000	224000	Then, in the absence of a solution,
224000	225000	how do I deal with it?
225000	227000	How do I get around with it?
227000	230000	The last part is actually more like my research.
230000	234000	If today I don't know
234000	238000	how these channels and links in the middle
238000	243000	are,
243000	244000	the detailed information
244000	248000	will not have any fundamental impact on my transmission.
248000	250000	That's the first part.
250000	252000	In fact, basically,
252000	254000	when we communicate,
254000	257000	the channels are always noisy,
257000	260000	they are always affected or interfered with by the transmission.
260000	262000	It's the same with wired communication,
262000	263000	and it's the same with wireless communication,
263000	265000	and the environment of wireless communication is more complicated.
265000	268000	Because of the so-called multipath effect,
268000	272000	the signal is distorted.
272000	274000	In addition to noise,
274000	276000	there is also distortion,
276000	278000	which means that at certain moments,
278000	279000	at certain times,
279000	281000	the intensity of my signal is actually very low.
281000	283000	Let's not discuss this complicated situation today.
283000	286000	Let's continue to discuss the above situation.
286000	289000	That is, in wired communication,
289000	292000	the signal is affected by noise.
292000	296000	When I receive this information,
296000	298000	it is inevitable that there will be errors,
298000	300000	and the information will be wrongly decrypted.
300000	303000	Common models,
303000	305000	common models for analysis,
305000	308000	include...
308000	309000	Wait a minute.
309000	310000	Common models for analysis,
310000	312000	there are the following two.
312000	314000	The first one is AWGN channel,
314000	316000	Additive Wide Gaussian Noise channel.
316000	318000	Basically, what it says is that
318000	321000	I input x1, x2 to xn.
321000	324000	The output I receive is y1, y2 to yn.
324000	328000	The output is what I send,
328000	331000	plus a random variable with a common distribution.
331000	333000	This random variable is a mutation.
333000	335000	But in fact, this problem is still very complicated.
335000	337000	We have made the problem so simple.
337000	338000	In fact, it is still very complicated.
338000	340000	So we will further consider
340000	344000	a simpler binary symmetric channel.
344000	345000	It only says that
345000	348000	the input today is x1 to xn.
349000	351000	At the receiving end,
351000	352000	we receive y1 to yn.
352000	354000	Then we limit x1.
354000	356000	Every x, every y,
356000	358000	is only 0 or 1.
358000	360000	What about the middle channel?
360000	362000	How does the middle channel
362000	364000	change these x and x?
364000	366000	For example, after sending in x1,
366000	368000	suppose it is 0,
368000	370000	then it has a certain probability
370000	372000	that p is converted to 1.
372000	374000	If it is converted to 1 today,
374000	376000	then this y1 is 1.
377000	379000	If it has not changed today,
379000	380000	then it is still 0.
380000	382000	Now the question is,
382000	384000	now the question is,
384000	386000	if I really use this,
386000	389000	suppose our channel is simplified like this,
389000	392000	only 0 or 1 can be fed in.
392000	394000	But there is a certain probability
394000	397000	that some input will be flipped,
397000	399000	will be changed.
399000	401000	How do I do the transmission?
401000	403000	How do I do the message transmission?
403000	404000	One way is
404000	406000	to send 0 or 1 directly.
406000	409000	Then I don't do any coding at all.
409000	411000	In this case,
411000	414000	the error rate is p.
414000	416000	Because it has given another x1,
416000	418000	its probability of being flipped is p.
418000	420000	So the error rate is p.
420000	422000	Is there a better way?
422000	423000	Of course there is.
423000	425000	We do some basic protection devices,
425000	427000	protection architecture.
427000	429000	For example, when I want to send 0,
429000	431000	I send it three times.
431000	432000	When I want to send 1,
432000	433000	I send it three times.
433000	435000	When I receive it,
435000	438000	we use the so-called multi-digit method.
438000	440000	The basic high-speed data can be calculated,
440000	441000	the error rate will be relatively low.
441000	443000	It probably looks like this.
443000	444000	But at the same time,
444000	446000	in order to send a bit,
446000	448000	I used three channels.
448000	450000	So my data rate,
450000	452000	that is, the speed of my data transmission
452000	453000	will be reduced.
453000	454000	Of course,
454000	456000	if I increase my repeated times,
456000	459000	it will definitely reduce my error rate.
459000	460000	But what is the price?
460000	462000	The price is that my data rate will be reduced.
462000	467000	And when my channel frequency increases,
467000	470000	its data rate will drop to 0.
470000	472000	In fact, this is not the result I want.
472000	474000	Because in order to protect it,
474000	475000	I send it so many times.
475000	478000	As a result, my data rate became low.
478000	481000	Then my question is,
481000	484000	is it possible to maintain the data rate at the same time?
484000	486000	For example, the data rate is not 0.
486000	489000	Reduce the error rate?
489000	493000	Then, this is a disaster question.
493000	496000	This is a problem that everyone can immediately think of.
496000	498000	But the first contribution is that
498000	501000	I will further analyze this problem.
501000	502000	The first one is
502000	505000	to further disassemble the question itself.
505000	506000	In the first part,
506000	508000	we add some conditions.
508000	512000	The first part is that we do not limit
512000	514000	coding or decoding.
514000	515000	For x,
515000	518000	I did not do any calculations for x.
518000	519000	For y,
519000	520000	I did not do any calculations for y.
520000	523000	There is no problem with computing complexity.
523000	524000	No matter if it is NP-complete.
524000	526000	If I have a super-powerful computer,
526000	528000	it can be instantly calculated.
528000	532000	Then, we do not limit the usage of channels.
532000	533000	Then,
533000	534000	further think about data.
534000	540000	These data bits can actually be borrowed from a table.
540000	543000	This table is on the right.
543000	544000	It sends these bits,
544000	545000	sends these data.
545000	546000	In fact, what did I send?
546000	548000	Which message did I send?
548000	550000	From 1 to M.
550000	551000	So,
551000	553000	the nature of this problem is to say,
553000	554000	for example,
554000	557000	I want to send the 10th message.
557000	560000	How do I design
560000	562000	this method of transmission
562000	565000	so that it can be correctly resolved
565000	567000	at the receiving end?
567000	568000	Then,
568000	570000	next is the rate.
570000	571000	The definition of rate,
571000	573000	as I just said,
573000	574000	is that
574000	576000	in the case of so many channels,
576000	578000	the usage of n channels,
578000	580000	how many bits did you send?
580000	581000	OK, there are M bits here.
581000	582000	So, in fact,
582000	585000	you can use log12 as your M to represent it.
585000	587000	So, there are a total of log12 bits.
587000	588000	So, you can get a basic,
588000	589000	this is the basic,
589000	591000	this is the level that high-level math can get.
591000	594000	That is, M can actually be written as 2nR square.
594000	595000	n is the usage of the channel.
595000	596000	Then,
596000	599000	R is the transmission speed.
599000	600000	Okay,
600000	601000	so, in fact, we will get used to it in the future.
601000	604000	We are used to using this 2nR square
604000	610000	to represent the number of messages.
610000	611000	Then,
611000	612000	it also tells you that
612000	614000	I want to make the error rate as small as possible.
614000	615000	It can only be said that
615000	616000	at the receiving end,
616000	618000	I sent a message
618000	619000	at the transmission end.
619000	621000	At the receiving end,
621000	623000	I will design a decoder.
623000	625000	The fan of the decoder is to guess.
625000	626000	So,
626000	628000	guess which message was sent.
628000	629000	I want to,
629000	630000	so this error means
630000	631000	this is my message.
631000	632000	For example, if I send the 10th message,
632000	633000	you may guess the 10,000th message.
633000	636000	That is, an error has occurred.
636000	638000	Then, we want to make the probability of this event
638000	640000	as small as possible.
640000	641000	But,
641000	642000	I must be,
642000	643000	for example,
643000	644000	the event is set,
644000	645000	for example,
645000	646000	10 to the 10th square,
646000	648000	10 to the 100th square,
648000	649000	and so on,
649000	651000	this kind of probability.
651000	652000	Okay,
652000	653000	so,
653000	654000	now,
654000	655000	these restrictions
655000	656000	are converted
656000	658000	into a transmission structure like this.
658000	659000	So,
659000	660000	there is a message in the lower left corner.
660000	661000	So many.
661000	662000	Then,
662000	663000	I can,
663000	664000	for example,
664000	665000	I want to send so many bits.
665000	666000	In fact,
666000	668000	I am sending a certain message.
668000	669000	Then,
669000	670000	it actually says,
670000	671000	OK,
671000	672000	I should pass this message
672000	673000	through a certain method.
673000	674000	For example,
674000	675000	check the table.
675000	676000	We build a
676000	677000	code book,
677000	678000	code book.
678000	679000	Each message corresponds
679000	681000	to a set of code words.
681000	682000	Then,
682000	684000	I use the way of checking the table
684000	686000	to make the message
686000	688000	into a code word.
688000	689000	Then,
689000	690000	send it to this channel.
690000	691000	Some bits are crooked.
691000	692000	Then,
692000	693000	received crooked.
693000	694000	Some of the crooked bits
694000	695000	may be flipped.
695000	696000	Then,
696000	697000	we use the decoder.
697000	698000	When the decoder is set,
698000	699000	I know,
699000	701000	everyone knows what the code book looks like.
701000	702000	Then,
702000	703000	we can decode
703000	704000	the message
704000	705000	we really want.
705000	706000	OK,
706000	707000	so,
707000	708000	now the question becomes,
708000	709000	can we design
709000	710000	such a coding scheme?
710000	711000	What is the coding scheme?
711000	712000	It is the code mode.
712000	713000	Code structure.
713000	714000	What is the code structure?
714000	715000	It includes
715000	716000	the code book.
716000	718000	The encoder is the same as the book.
718000	719000	It is just a table.
719000	720000	And,
720000	721000	my decoder,
721000	723000	my decoder,
723000	725000	my code book requires
725000	726000	whether it can
726000	727000	be its
727000	728000	code rate,
728000	729000	its transmission speed,
729000	730000	whether it is
730000	731000	not zero,
731000	733000	or not a very small value.
733000	734000	And,
734000	735000	my decoding error,
735000	736000	it can be controlled
736000	738000	at a very small value.
738000	739000	OK,
739000	740000	so,
740000	741000	this is,
741000	742000	so,
742000	743000	now,
743000	744000	we have formulated
744000	745000	the problem structure
745000	746000	like this.
746000	747000	We have
747000	748000	the encoder,
748000	749000	the decoder.
749000	750000	Then,
750000	751000	our goal is to
751000	752000	pass this message
752000	753000	to the other end.
753000	754000	Then,
754000	755000	here,
755000	756000	I want this mhat,
756000	757000	that is,
757000	758000	that is,
758000	759000	the received end
759000	760000	guess the m,
760000	762000	guess the message,
762000	763000	the less chance of error,
763000	765000	the better.
765000	766000	Or,
766000	767000	it is in a certain,
767000	769000	the chance of error
769000	770000	is in a certain value
770000	771000	below,
771000	772000	OK.
772000	773000	Then,
773000	774000	this answer,
774000	775000	I can,
775000	776000	so,
776000	777000	I just,
777000	778000	I have already exploded,
778000	779000	that is,
779000	780000	that is,
780000	781000	this is actually possible,
781000	782000	can be done.
782000	783000	Otherwise,
783000	784000	I can't go on,
784000	785000	right?
785000	786000	I can't go on.
786000	787000	Then,
787000	788000	it is,
788000	789000	then,
789000	790000	it is with,
790000	791000	then,
791000	792000	this is Shannon's
792000	793000	contribution
793000	794000	in 1948,
794000	795000	which is
795000	796000	one of his most
796000	797000	famous contributions.
797000	798000	Then,
798000	799000	then,
799000	800000	he,
830000	831000	he,
831000	832000	he made
832000	833000	a set of
833000	834000	coding schemes
834000	835000	including what codebook
835000	835600	plus the
835600	836600	processor.
836600	837600	And then,
837600	838600	but this m maybe
838600	839600	big
839600	840600	let my error rate,
840600	841600	that is my
841600	842600	effect,
842600	843600	that is,
843600	844600	the error can be
844600	845600	pulled to what I want
845600	846600	that,
846600	847600	that is,
847600	848600	the level of
848600	849600	minus 100
849600	850600	quadrature.
850600	851600	But,
851600	852600	if you are
852600	853600	uh,
853600	854600	if you shoot
854600	855600	too quickly
855600	856600	that legendary speed
856600	857600	today,
857600	858600	too fast,
858600	859600	too high,
859600	860600	that
860600	861600	problem came.
861600	862600	If you
862600	863600	today,
863600	864600	then
864600	865600	uh,
865600	866600	the problem
866600	867600	on the project
867600	868600	came,
868600	869600	because
869600	870600	there may
870600	871600	be
871600	872600	you for all
872600	873600	N,
873600	874600	for all
874600	875600	uh,
875600	876600	no matter
876600	877600	you look for
877600	878600	all possible
878600	879600	ways,
879600	880600	you can't
880600	881600	let my
881600	882600	error rate
882600	883600	be able to
883600	884600	drop to
884600	885600	the level
885600	886600	you want
886600	887600	.
887600	888600	For example,
888600	889600	if you
889600	890600	start to
890600	891600	drop to
891600	892600	10-100
892600	893600	quadrature,
893600	894600	10-6
894600	895600	quadrature,
895600	896600	10-7
896600	897600	quadrature,
897600	898600	you will find
898600	899600	that
899600	900600	you can't
900600	901600	find it,
901600	902600	no matter
902600	903600	how much
903600	904600	you use,
904600	905600	you can't
905600	906600	find this
906600	907600	coding
907600	908600	method.
908600	909600	OK,
909600	910600	so this is
910600	911600	that,
911600	912600	this is called
912600	913600	Noisy Channel
913600	914600	Coding Theorem,
914600	915600	and then
915600	916600	we put this
916600	917600	in our
917600	918600	code,
918600	919600	and then
919600	920600	there are
920600	921600	any questions
921600	922600	you can
922600	923600	ask,
923600	924600	because
924600	925600	in fact,
925600	926600	I should be,
926600	927600	yes,
927600	928600	it should be
928600	929600	like the
929600	930600	host said,
930600	931600	it's really
931600	932600	quite mathematical
932600	933600	here,
933600	934600	and then
934600	935600	uh,
935600	936600	I used to
936600	937600	do is
937600	938600	more engineering
938600	939600	problems,
939600	940600	and then
940600	941600	turn to
941600	942600	more theoretical
942600	943600	problems,
943600	944600	in fact,
944600	945600	it was a
945600	946600	long time
946600	947600	ago,
947600	948600	so it's
948600	949600	completely different,
949600	950600	it takes some
950600	951600	time to
951600	952600	switch,
952600	953600	OK,
953600	954600	so here
954600	955600	is a magical
955600	956600	number,
956600	957600	which is
957600	958600	called
958600	959600	Channel Capacity,
959600	960600	and then
960600	961600	it is
961600	962600	like this,
962600	963600	this thing,
963600	964600	what is
964600	965600	this thing?
965600	966600	This thing
966600	967600	actually,
967600	968600	uh,
968600	969600	there is also
969600	970600	a mathematical
970600	971600	definition,
971600	972600	it is,
972600	973600	uh,
973600	974600	seems to be
974600	975600	very complicated,
975600	976600	which is
976600	977600	the so-called
977600	978600	Entropy,
978600	979600	if you are
979600	980600	reading physics,
980600	981600	you will know
981600	982600	what is called
982600	983600	Entropy,
983600	984600	if you are reading
984600	985600	chemistry,
985600	986600	you know
986600	987600	what is
987600	988600	Entropy,
988600	989600	it basically
989600	990600	measures
990600	991600	how messy
991600	992600	a system
992600	993600	is,
993600	994600	but the
994600	995600	Entropy here
995600	996600	is not the
996600	997600	same as
997600	998600	that side,
998600	999600	the Entropy
999600	1000600	definition here
1000600	1001600	is that
1001600	1002600	oh,
1002600	1003600	if today,
1003600	1004600	in fact,
1004600	1005600	the probability
1005600	1006600	is so much,
1006600	1007600	p of x,
1007600	1008600	uh,
1008600	1009600	px of e,
1009600	1010600	then multiply by log,
1010600	1011600	there is also
1011600	1012600	uh,
1012600	1013600	p of x,
1013600	1014600	uh,
1014600	1015600	p of x,
1015600	1016600	1,
1016600	1017600	1,
1017600	1018600	so much,
1018600	1019600	and then
1019600	1020600	zero,
1020600	1021600	zero in,
1021600	1022600	the calculated value
1022600	1023600	is the Entropy
1023600	1024600	of x,
1024600	1025600	the Entropy
1025600	1026600	of random variables
1026600	1027600	of x.
1027600	1028600	Okay,
1028600	1029600	so what it means
1029600	1030600	is actually
1030600	1031600	the uncertainty
1031600	1032600	of x,
1032600	1033600	and then
1033600	1034600	the uncertainty
1034600	1035600	of random variables
1035600	1036600	of x.
1036600	1037600	Before you do the experiment,
1037600	1038600	you don't know
1038600	1039600	how much it is,
1039600	1040600	but after you do the experiment,
1040600	1041600	OK,
1041600	1042600	how many bits
1042600	1043600	do you need
1043600	1044600	to represent
1044600	1045600	the result of the experiment?
1045600	1046600	OK,
1046600	1047600	that is to say,
1047600	1048600	uh,
1048600	1049600	how many,
1049600	1050600	it means that
1050600	1051600	you have,
1051600	1052600	uh,
1052600	1053600	you have,
1053600	1054600	uh,
1054600	1055600	yeah,
1055600	1056600	that's about it,
1056600	1057600	and then
1057600	1058600	it's actually
1058600	1059600	listed on the
1059600	1060600	internet,
1060600	1061600	it's
1061600	1062600	19 equations
1062600	1063600	for
1063600	1064600	the
1064600	1065600	Entropy
1065600	1066600	of information.
1066600	1067600	OK,
1067600	1068600	so we have this thing,
1068600	1069600	we have this,
1069600	1070600	after its interpretation,
1070600	1071600	the Entropy
1071600	1072600	is,
1072600	1073600	uh,
1073600	1074600	the uncertainty
1074600	1075600	of x,
1075600	1076600	in terms of bits,
1076600	1077600	or we need to know
1077600	1078600	the number of x,
1078600	1079600	we need to know
1079600	1080600	the number of bits.
1080600	1081600	So,
1081600	1082600	let's see
1082600	1083600	what this thing is,
1083600	1084600	I of x,
1084600	1085600	divided by y,
1085600	1086600	it,
1086600	1087600	uh,
1087600	1088600	its name is
1088600	1089600	Mutual Information.
1089600	1090600	It,
1090600	1091600	from the second
1091600	1092600	interpretation,
1092600	1093600	we can see that
1093600	1094600	it's actually
1094600	1095600	the uncertainty of x
1095600	1096600	divided by,
1096600	1097600	after giving y,
1097600	1098600	how much uncertainty
1098600	1099600	does x have left?
1099600	1100600	OK,
1100600	1101600	so what does it mean?
1101600	1102600	It's actually,
1102600	1103600	if you know,
1103600	1104600	uh,
1104600	1105600	in the case of y,
1105600	1106600	uh,
1106600	1107600	you know in the case of y,
1107600	1108600	how many bits
1108600	1109600	do you actually have,
1109600	1110600	uh,
1110600	1111600	you,
1111600	1112600	you can know
1112600	1113600	how many bits x is.
1113600	1114600	So,
1114600	1115600	to a certain extent,
1115600	1116600	this is actually
1116600	1117600	what we want,
1117600	1118600	in terms of intuitive meaning,
1118600	1119600	it's actually,
1119600	1120600	uh,
1120600	1121600	how many bits x is.
1121600	1122600	So,
1122600	1124600	what Mutual Information
1124600	1125600	actually gives me is,
1125600	1126600	uh,
1126600	1127600	x is,
1127600	1128600	uh,
1128600	1129600	in the case of giving y,
1129600	1130600	I know
1130600	1131600	how many things x has.
1131600	1132600	I know x's,
1132600	1134600	what x's value is,
1134600	1135600	in terms of bits,
1135600	1136600	like this.
1136600	1137600	OK,
1137600	1138600	so,
1138600	1139600	uh,
1139600	1140600	so intuitively speaking,
1140600	1141600	this seems to be
1141600	1142600	what we want,
1142600	1143600	but
1143600	1144600	in fact,
1144600	1145600	this proof is
1145600	1146600	very,
1146600	1147600	very difficult.
1147600	1148600	And then,
1148600	1149600	because of this proof,
1149600	1150600	there's a new field called
1150600	1151600	telecommunications,
1151600	1152600	telecommunications engineering,
1152600	1153600	there's a new field called
1153600	1154600	news theory.
1154600	1155600	So,
1155600	1156600	so this proof,
1156600	1157600	in fact,
1157600	1158600	in our field,
1158600	1159600	the proof is divided into two parts.
1159600	1160600	The first part is the so-called
1160600	1161600	converse part.
1161600	1162600	It proves that,
1162600	1163600	OK,
1163600	1164600	my code,
1164600	1165600	my transmission speed is greater than c,
1165600	1166600	it's impossible.
1166600	1167600	The second part is the
1167600	1168600	achievability part,
1168600	1169600	which is
1169600	1170600	achievability is
1170600	1171600	achievable,
1171600	1172600	achievable,
1172600	1173600	that kind of part.
1173600	1174600	So,
1174600	1175600	it only says,
1175600	1176600	uh,
1176600	1177600	I,
1177600	1178600	I actually have to find a
1178600	1179600	way to make
1179600	1180600	this code
1180600	1181600	pass,
1181600	1182600	pass with such a high speed,
1182600	1183600	pass with such a high speed,
1183600	1184600	pass with such a high speed,
1184600	1185600	pass with such a high speed,
1185600	1186600	OK.
1186600	1187600	pass with such a high speed,
1187600	1188600	pass with such a high speed,
1188600	1189600	OK.
1189600	1190600	OK.
1190600	1191600	Of course,
1191600	1192600	in the process of passing,
1192600	1193600	we have to,
1193600	1194600	uh,
1194600	1195600	we,
1195600	1196600	but we have to specify my
1196600	1197600	error rate first,
1197600	1198600	for example,
1198600	1199600	10 to the minus 100 times,
1199600	1200600	and then,
1200600	1201600	we have to find
1201600	1202600	such a coding scheme,
1202600	1203600	and then,
1203600	1204600	and then,
1204600	1205600	of course,
1205600	1206600	nk is any nk,
1206600	1207600	it may take
1207600	1208600	a while,
1208600	1209600	OK.
1209600	1210600	OK,
1210600	1211600	then,
1211600	1212600	sorry,
1212600	1213600	can I ask a question?
1213600	1214600	Yes, please.
1214600	1215600	This is,
1215600	1216600	uh,
1216600	1217600	because I don't understand
1217600	1218600	it at all,
1218600	1219600	so,
1219600	1220600	uh,
1220600	1221600	this is,
1221600	1222600	I want,
1222600	1223600	can you give an example?
1223600	1224600	For example,
1224600	1225600	suppose I know,
1225600	1226600	suppose I have a
1226600	1227600	method of passing,
1227600	1228600	then,
1228600	1229600	I,
1229600	1230600	I,
1230600	1231600	after I get y,
1231600	1232600	I'm totally sure
1232600	1233600	how much x is,
1233600	1234600	then,
1234600	1235600	what would i be?
1235600	1236600	Would i be 0?
1236600	1237600	OK,
1237600	1238600	if you know,
1238600	1239600	for example,
1239600	1240600	like this,
1240600	1241600	uh,
1241600	1242600	uh,
1242600	1243600	if you say you know,
1243600	1244600	after you get x,
1244600	1245600	you totally know
1245600	1246600	how much x is,
1246600	1247600	right?
1247600	1248600	So,
1248600	1249600	my question is,
1249600	1250600	you have an ideal channel,
1250600	1251600	yes,
1251600	1252600	no noise at all,
1252600	1253600	yes,
1253600	1254600	then,
1254600	1255600	after you get y,
1255600	1256600	you totally know
1256600	1257600	how much x is,
1257600	1258600	yes,
1258600	1259600	yes,
1259600	1260600	then,
1260600	1261600	in the following,
1261600	1262600	probability should be 0,
1262600	1263600	right?
1263600	1264600	No,
1264600	1265600	no,
1265600	1266600	so,
1266600	1267600	the x itself,
1267600	1268600	the x itself,
1268600	1269600	it's,
1269600	1270600	OK,
1270600	1271600	it means,
1271600	1272600	if you use this way,
1272600	1273600	I can,
1273600	1274600	I can answer you like this,
1274600	1275600	like,
1275600	1276600	if you know y,
1276600	1277600	then,
1277600	1278600	you know x,
1278600	1279600	then,
1279600	1280600	suppose it's a channel
1280600	1281600	with no noise,
1281600	1282600	x is actually,
1282600	1283600	you know y,
1283600	1284600	you know x,
1284600	1285600	so,
1285600	1286600	you know the uncertainty of x,
1286600	1287600	after you know y,
1287600	1288600	the uncertainty of x is 0,
1288600	1289600	so,
1289600	1290600	this one is 0,
1290600	1291600	so,
1291600	1292600	this mutual information,
1292600	1293600	mutual information
1293600	1294600	is equal to
1294600	1295600	x's,
1295600	1296600	like,
1296600	1297600	you can think about
1297600	1298600	how many bits x has,
1298600	1299600	for example,
1299600	1300600	if you use this formula
1300600	1301600	to measure,
1301600	1302600	for example,
1302600	1303600	the way you code is
1303600	1304600	using,
1304600	1305600	for example,
1305600	1306600	50% chance is 1,
1306600	1307600	50% chance is 0,
1307600	1308600	then,
1308600	1309600	in this way,
1309600	1310600	if you can,
1310600	1311600	you put this,
1311600	1312600	this,
1312600	1313600	for example,
1313600	1314600	you take this data
1314600	1315600	to calculate
1315600	1316600	h of x,
1316600	1317600	the answer will be 1,
1317600	1318600	OK,
1318600	1319600	what does it mean?
1319600	1320600	What does it mean?
1320600	1321600	So,
1321600	1322600	p is 1 in 2,
1322600	1323600	right?
1323600	1324600	p is 1,
1324600	1325600	right?
1325600	1326600	OK,
1326600	1327600	2 is 1,
1327600	1328600	then,
1328600	1329600	log is 1 in 2,
1329600	1330600	1 in 1 in 2 is 1,
1330600	1331600	this value is 1,
1331600	1332600	so,
1332600	1333600	there are two 1 in 2,
1333600	1334600	right?
1334600	1335600	OK,
1335600	1336600	so,
1336600	1337600	adding up is 1,
1337600	1338600	OK,
1338600	1339600	so,
1339600	1340600	this value,
1340600	1341600	i,
1341600	1342600	this mutual information,
1342600	1343600	mutual information is 1,
1343600	1344600	what does it mean?
1344600	1345600	It means that
1345600	1346600	my transmission speed
1346600	1347600	can be 1,
1347600	1348600	1 bit per channel use,
1348600	1349600	OK,
1349600	1350600	so,
1350600	1351600	channel capacity will be 1,
1351600	1352600	right,
1352600	1353600	OK,
1353600	1354600	right,
1354600	1355600	and you can easily
1355600	1356600	prove this thing,
1356600	1357600	why?
1357600	1358600	Because the channel is noise,
1358600	1359600	so,
1359600	1360600	no matter what you send,
1360600	1361600	it will receive,
1361600	1362600	it should be said that
1362600	1363600	what I received
1363600	1364600	is exactly the same as what I send,
1364600	1365600	right?
1365600	1366600	Then it means that
1366600	1367600	there is no channel,
1367600	1368600	I will directly go to
1368600	1369600	take my,
1369600	1370600	I know this,
1370600	1371600	OK,
1371600	1372600	this base case,
1372600	1373600	I understand now,
1373600	1374600	OK,
1374600	1375600	right,
1375600	1376600	OK,
1376600	1377600	then,
1377600	1378600	I should give a,
1378600	1379600	I actually wrote an example
1379600	1380600	in my lecture,
1380600	1381600	but I forgot to say,
1381600	1382600	I want to clarify,
1382600	1383600	that is,
1383600	1384600	that is,
1384600	1385600	the example just now
1385600	1386600	is not to say,
1386600	1387600	how to say,
1387600	1388600	in the case of noiseless,
1388600	1389600	mutual information
1389600	1390600	is always 1,
1390600	1391600	the example just now
1391600	1392600	is 1,
1392600	1393600	OK,
1393600	1394600	this is related to
1394600	1395600	your encoding method,
1395600	1396600	right?
1396600	1397600	Right,
1397600	1398600	OK,
1398600	1399600	OK,
1399600	1400600	so,
1400600	1401600	in my X,
1401600	1402600	for example,
1402600	1403600	if today
1403600	1404600	my X
1404600	1405600	is 10%,
1405600	1406600	for example,
1406600	1407600	like,
1407600	1408600	another example,
1408600	1409600	suppose my X,
1409600	1410600	encoding method
1410600	1411600	100% is 1,
1411600	1412600	0% is
1412600	1413600	0,
1413600	1414600	that means
1414600	1415600	everything I send
1415600	1416600	is all 1,
1416600	1417600	right?
1417600	1418600	Right,
1418600	1419600	right,
1419600	1420600	that's right,
1420600	1421600	right,
1421600	1422600	this is another extreme example,
1422600	1423600	then,
1423600	1424600	in this case,
1424600	1425600	you can figure out that
1425600	1426600	entropy is actually 0,
1426600	1427600	right,
1427600	1428600	because 1 times
1428600	1429600	so you didn't
1429600	1430600	send any information
1430600	1431600	out,
1431600	1432600	right,
1432600	1433600	that's right,
1433600	1434600	then this
1434600	1435600	is 0,
1435600	1436600	so,
1436600	1437600	so that means,
1437600	1438600	OK,
1438600	1439600	you want to
1439600	1440600	say,
1440600	1441600	OK,
1441600	1442600	OK,
1442600	1443600	OK,
1443600	1444600	OK,
1444600	1445600	OK,
1445600	1446600	OK,
1446600	1447600	OK,
1447600	1448600	OK,
1448600	1449600	OK,
1449600	1450600	OK,
1450600	1451600	OK,
1451600	1452600	OK,
1452600	1453600	OK,
1453600	1454600	OK,
1454600	1455600	OK,
1455600	1456600	OK,
1456600	1457600	OK,
1457600	1458600	OK,
1458600	1459600	OK,
1459600	1460600	so,
1460600	1461600	the next thing
1461600	1462600	we have to ask is,
1462600	1463600	how do I
1463600	1464600	get to this thing?
1464600	1465600	Because I'm
1465600	1466600	always at this thing,
1466600	1467600	actually,
1467600	1468600	because,
1468600	1469600	how do I get to this thing?
1469600	1470600	He said,
1470600	1471600	I can use
1471600	1472600	such a fast speed
1472600	1473600	to code,
1473600	1474600	to pass information.
1474600	1475600	So,
1475600	1476600	how do I actually do this thing?
1476600	1477600	So,
1477600	1478600	I'm trying to use
1478600	1479600	some examples
1479600	1480600	to talk about this.
1480600	1481600	Because his,
1481600	1482600	let's see,
1482600	1483600	let's see if
1483600	1484600	I can finish
1484600	1485600	in a short time,
1485600	1486600	to make it clear,
1486600	1487600	like this.
1487600	1488600	OK,
1488600	1489600	so,
1489600	1490600	what is the current goal?
1490600	1491600	I'm going to find a codebook.
1491600	1492600	And then,
1492600	1493600	his,
1493600	1494600	his,
1494600	1495600	his,
1495600	1496600	the speed of coding
1496600	1497600	is,
1497600	1498600	or his speed of transmission
1498600	1499600	is very close to
1499600	1500600	his dc.
1500600	1501600	And then,
1501600	1502600	there is a decoder.
1502600	1503600	He is a decoder.
1503600	1504600	OK,
1504600	1505600	so he's looking for these two things.
1505600	1506600	Let's assume
1506600	1507600	my input is,
1507600	1508600	this is 0,
1508600	1509600	input,
1509600	1510600	x,
1510600	1511600	x1 is
1511600	1512600	0.5 when it is equal to 1,
1512600	1513600	0.5 when it is equal to 0.
1513600	1514600	And then,
1514600	1515600	the channel,
1515600	1516600	this channel,
1516600	1517600	the probability of flipping is 0.1.
1517600	1518600	That is,
1518600	1519600	if I enter 0 here,
1519600	1520600	10% of the probability
1520600	1521600	will be turned into 1,
1521600	1522600	90% of the probability,
1522600	1523600	90% of the probability
1523600	1524600	will still remain the same,
1524600	1525600	like this.
1525600	1526600	OK,
1526600	1527600	OK,
1527600	1528600	OK,
1528600	1529600	so,
1529600	1530600	in fact,
1530600	1531600	how do they think about this problem?
1531600	1532600	He actually wants to say,
1532600	1533600	OK,
1533600	1534600	then I just randomly generate
1534600	1535600	that,
1535600	1536600	I have a random number generator,
1536600	1537600	I just randomly generate
1537600	1538600	0 and 1,
1538600	1539600	a total of n.
1539600	1540600	Then,
1540600	1541600	I use this,
1541600	1542600	these points mean that
1542600	1543600	there is a set of results.
1543600	1544600	Then,
1544600	1545600	I use this big circle
1545600	1546600	to represent
1546600	1547600	all possible situations.
1547600	1548600	So,
1548600	1549600	these points
1549600	1550600	are actually
1550600	1551600	just a few,
1551600	1552600	just a few examples.
1552600	1553600	OK,
1553600	1554600	according to the rule of large numbers,
1554600	1555600	I use
1555600	1556600	the probability
1556600	1557600	XR,
1557600	1558600	its probability of
1558600	1559600	1 is 0.5,
1559600	1560600	the probability of 0
1560600	1561600	is also 0.5.
1561600	1562600	So,
1562600	1563600	what does it mean?
1563600	1564600	I can find some,
1564600	1565600	OK,
1565600	1566600	I can find some,
1566600	1567600	for example,
1567600	1568600	this red dot,
1568600	1569600	I can find some codes,
1569600	1570600	it is about 50%
1570600	1571600	of the composition,
1571600	1572600	about half is 1,
1572600	1573600	half is,
1573600	1574600	the other half is 0,
1574600	1575600	like the red code
1575600	1576600	is like this.
1576600	1577600	The green code is also like this,
1577600	1578600	that is,
1578600	1579600	the front half is 1,
1579600	1580600	the back half is 0,
1580600	1581600	like this green one
1581600	1582600	is the same,
1582600	1583600	the front half is 0,
1583600	1584600	the back half is 1,
1584600	1585600	OK,
1585600	1586600	the rule of large numbers
1586600	1587600	tells us that
1587600	1589600	I randomly generate
1589600	1592600	a set of code words,
1592600	1593600	it will fall into
1593600	1595600	this blue set,
1595600	1596600	we call this
1596600	1597600	typical set,
1597600	1598600	it will fall into this set,
1598600	1599600	the probability of it is 1.
1599600	1600600	Why?
1600600	1601600	For example,
1601600	1602600	like this,
1602600	1603600	for example,
1603600	1604600	like this,
1604600	1605600	all of them are
1605600	1606600	1.
1606600	1607600	OK,
1607600	1608600	if today,
1608600	1609600	although,
1609600	1610600	all of them are 1.
1610600	1611600	OK,
1611600	1612600	then,
1612600	1613600	this situation
1613600	1614600	is very unlikely to happen,
1614600	1615600	right?
1615600	1616600	Right?
1616600	1617600	According to the rule of large numbers,
1617600	1618600	it,
1618600	1619600	you have to generate all of it,
1619600	1620600	you have to throw the copper plate,
1620600	1621600	throw it 10,000 times in a row,
1621600	1622600	it's all positive,
1622600	1624600	basically 0.
1624600	1625600	If all of them
1625600	1627600	are all 0,
1627600	1628600	there is a chance of the opposite,
1628600	1630600	it's all close to 0.
1630600	1631600	So,
1631600	1632600	only in,
1632600	1633600	so,
1633600	1634600	this thing
1634600	1635600	will not fall into
1635600	1636600	this blue area,
1636600	1637600	this blue area
1637600	1638600	is the collection of all
1638600	1639600	that,
1639600	1640600	54% is 1,
1640600	1641600	54% is 0,
1641600	1642600	all the sequences,
1642600	1643600	all of that,
1643600	1644600	the code word,
1644600	1645600	like this.
1645600	1646600	OK,
1646600	1647600	if I choose a red code word today,
1647600	1648600	and then take it,
1648600	1649600	let it pass,
1649600	1650600	what will happen to me?
1650600	1651600	What is this channel
1651600	1652600	actually doing?
1652600	1653600	Is to take these
1653600	1654600	101010,
1654600	1655600	and then,
1655600	1656600	I go,
1656600	1657600	when passing through the channel,
1657600	1658600	these 10 will be
1658600	1659600	the most random flip,
1659600	1660600	some may not change,
1660600	1662600	some may flip.
1662600	1663600	That,
1663600	1664600	there is about 10%,
1664600	1665600	about 10% of the,
1665600	1667600	10% of the bit
1667600	1668600	may be flipped,
1668600	1670600	90% of the chance will not,
1670600	1671600	90% of the bit
1671600	1672600	will not be flipped,
1672600	1673600	because this is
1673600	1674600	a channel feature.
1674600	1675600	OK,
1675600	1676600	what does it mean
1676600	1677600	in math?
1677600	1678600	In fact,
1678600	1679600	I am the original thing,
1679600	1680600	plus a sequence,
1680600	1681600	that is,
1681600	1682600	I just add
1682600	1683600	component y,
1683600	1684600	and then,
1684600	1685600	what is this zn?
1685600	1686600	This zn is actually
1686600	1687600	10% is 1,
1687600	1688600	90% is 0.
1688600	1689600	OK,
1689600	1690600	and then,
1690600	1691600	that,
1691600	1692600	that is also very likely,
1692600	1693600	that is also,
1693600	1694600	according to the rule of thumb,
1694600	1695600	this is also very likely,
1695600	1696600	this is very likely
1696600	1697600	to happen,
1697600	1698600	and the probability of happening
1698600	1699600	is very close to 1.
1699600	1700600	OK,
1700600	1701600	what will happen?
1701600	1702600	What will happen?
1702600	1703600	It will be found that
1703600	1704600	my red,
1704600	1705600	after going through
1705600	1706600	my own disturbance,
1706600	1707600	it may be
1707600	1708600	this red,
1708600	1709600	in the small circle,
1709600	1711600	any of the red points.
1711600	1712600	OK,
1712600	1713600	then we put
1713600	1714600	this kind of thing,
1714600	1715600	every point is actually
1715600	1716600	a sequence,
1716600	1717600	n,
1717600	1718600	the length is n sequence,
1718600	1719600	0, 1 sequence.
1719600	1720600	That,
1720600	1721600	specifically,
1721600	1722600	which,
1722600	1723600	which is flipped,
1723600	1724600	in fact,
1724600	1725600	we do not know,
1725600	1726600	we put it all
1726600	1727600	in here.
1727600	1728600	That,
1728600	1729600	I pass
1729600	1730600	101010
1730600	1731600	the situation,
1731600	1733600	I received the y,
1733600	1734600	uh,
1734600	1735600	what is it,
1735600	1736600	like this,
1736600	1737600	and then,
1737600	1738600	what is it,
1738600	1739600	it is 101010
1739600	1740600	plus that,
1740600	1741600	all possible,
1741600	1742600	all,
1742600	1743600	uh,
1743600	1744600	the probability of occurrence is very high,
1744600	1745600	the result of the disturbance,
1745600	1746600	for example,
1746600	1747600	there are
1747600	1748600	the first 10% is 1,
1748600	1749600	the rest is 0,
1749600	1750600	then we put it
1750600	1751600	in this,
1751600	1752600	this collection.
1752600	1753600	Then,
1753600	1754600	this,
1754600	1755600	then,
1755600	1756600	this red dot is,
1756600	1757600	for example,
1757600	1758600	101010
1758600	1759600	plus,
1759600	1760600	the first 10% is 1,
1760600	1761600	the rest is 0,
1761600	1762600	the result,
1762600	1763600	like this.
1763600	1764600	OK,
1764600	1765600	the same,
1765600	1766600	the same thing,
1766600	1767600	that,
1767600	1768600	these things are all very likely to happen,
1768600	1769600	because according to the law of magnitude,
1769600	1770600	that,
1770600	1771600	the same truth,
1771600	1772600	we can,
1772600	1773600	what,
1773600	1774600	we can,
1774600	1775600	uh,
1775600	1776600	we can see that,
1776600	1777600	OK,
1777600	1778600	in fact,
1778600	1779600	uh,
1779600	1780600	you just said that the small circle,
1780600	1781600	in fact,
1781600	1782600	in the red circle,
1782600	1783600	the red circle,
1783600	1784600	it itself also has that,
1784600	1785600	that,
1785600	1786600	it itself is channel output,
1786600	1787600	that is,
1787600	1788600	its so-called typical set.
1788600	1789600	We can figure out that,
1789600	1790600	OK,
1790600	1791600	Y actually has 51%,
1791600	1792600	50% is 0,
1792600	1793600	then we collect those,
1793600	1794600	half is 1,
1794600	1795600	half is 0,
1795600	1796600	those sequences,
1796600	1797600	we collect them in here.
1797600	1798600	Then,
1798600	1799600	we put these green dots,
1799600	1800600	this green dot,
1800600	1801600	this green dot,
1801600	1802600	this green dot,
1802600	1803600	this green dot,
1803600	1804600	these four green dots,
1804600	1805600	through this way of passing,
1805600	1806600	we can receive these,
1806600	1807600	uh,
1807600	1808600	for example,
1808600	1809600	the green dot on the far left,
1809600	1810600	what it receives is,
1810600	1811600	it may be,
1811600	1812600	this green small circle inside,
1812600	1813600	the top one,
1813600	1814600	what it receives is this,
1814600	1815600	the right one,
1815600	1816600	the bottom one,
1816600	1817600	is the one at the bottom.
1817600	1818600	OK.
1818600	1819600	Good.
1819600	1820600	Then,
1820600	1821600	I'm going to design this decoder.
1821600	1822600	Of course,
1822600	1823600	you can observe that,
1823600	1824600	if the dots I choose today,
1824600	1825600	are very few,
1825600	1826600	for example,
1826600	1827600	I only choose these five dots,
1827600	1828600	then in fact,
1828600	1829600	after it is printed,
1829600	1830600	I see on the Y,
1830600	1831600	I see on the Y,
1831600	1832600	that they may not
1832600	1833600	overlap,
1833600	1834600	that they may not overlap,
1834600	1835600	they are all independent,
1835600	1836600	they are all disjoint.
1836600	1837600	they are all independent,
1837600	1838600	they are all disjoint.
1838600	1839600	So,
1839600	1840600	what does it mean?
1840600	1841600	As long as its red dot
1841600	1842600	appears in the red area,
1842600	1843600	appears in the red area,
1843600	1844600	we can see that
1844600	1845600	Ah,
1845600	1847600	it wears this.
1847600	1849600	The green on the left,
1849600	1850600	if it's sent here,
1850600	1851600	the green on the left,
1851600	1854600	We tell directly that
1854600	1855600	it wears this?
1855600	1856600	OK.
1856600	1857600	Therefore,
1857600	1858600	we can design the decoder.
1858600	1859600	Then,
1859600	1860600	I am going to see
1860600	1861600	I am going to design the decoder.
1861600	1862600	Then,
1862600	1863600	I'm going to see
1863600	1864600	this Y,
1864600	1865600	or the Sequence
1865600	1866600	that is received by me
1866600	1868600	or security
1868600	1871600	or security
1871600	1872600	into this compound.
1872600	1873600	If it's in this set,
1873600	1875600	if it's in this set,
1875600	1877600	I will decode the Y
1877600	1879600	into the corresponding X.
1879600	1882600	into the corresponding X.
1882600	1883600	For example,
1883600	1884600	if Y is in red,
1884600	1886600	I will decode it into red.
1886600	1888600	If Y is in the upper left corner,
1888600	1890600	I will decode it into the upper left corner.
1890600	1892600	I will decode it into the upper left corner.
1892600	1893600	OK.
1893600	1894600	OK.
1894600	1895600	This is the most mathematical part.
1895600	1896600	This is the most mathematical part
1896600	1897600	of the whole decoding.
1897600	1899600	We can calculate
1899600	1901600	how many
1901600	1904600	how many
1904600	1906600	how many
1906600	1907600	OK.
1907600	1908600	I should say like this.
1908600	1909600	OK.
1909600	1910600	This is the design of the decoder.
1910600	1912600	I just said that
1912600	1913600	if they don't overlap
1913600	1914600	these small groups
1914600	1916600	or circles,
1916600	1917600	then
1917600	1919600	I can successfully decode
1919600	1920600	and there is no error, right?
1920600	1921600	Or the error rate
1921600	1922600	I can say that
1922600	1923600	I have no error.
1923600	1925600	But if today
1925600	1926600	there is a little
1926600	1927600	allow a little overlap,
1927600	1928600	then we can
1928600	1929600	let the error rate
1929600	1930600	let the error rate
1930600	1931600	control the threshold
1931600	1933600	control the threshold
1933600	1934600	that we want
1934600	1935600	10 to the negative 6th square
1935600	1936600	10 to the negative 100th square.
1936600	1937600	OK.
1937600	1938600	Today
1938600	1939600	Now the problem is that
1939600	1940600	OK.
1940600	1941600	We can't choose too many
1941600	1942600	OK.
1942600	1943600	We can't choose too many
1943600	1944600	these points.
1944600	1945600	For example, we just chose 5 points.
1945600	1946600	It has made this
1946600	1947600	red inside
1947600	1948600	so many crowded
1948600	1949600	small circles.
1949600	1950600	If we choose
1950600	1951600	a few more,
1951600	1952600	then these small circles
1952600	1953600	will actually overlap.
1953600	1954600	As long as there is a large
1954600	1955600	large-scale overlap
1955600	1956600	large-scale overlap
1956600	1957600	large-scale overlap
1957600	1958600	large-scale overlap
1958600	1959600	the error rate
1959600	1960600	and the error rate
1960600	1961600	is still very high.
1961600	1962600	OK.
1962600	1963600	We try to avoid
1963600	1964600	this situation.
1964600	1965600	So how do we see it?
1965600	1966600	Let's see
1966600	1967600	OK.
1967600	1968600	Let's see
1968600	1969600	in this blue circle
1969600	1970600	how many
1970600	1971600	how many
1971600	1972600	how many
1972600	1973600	how many
1973600	1974600	code words are in it.
1974600	1975600	Then we put this
1975600	1976600	blue circle
1976600	1977600	called TX
1977600	1978600	like this.
1978600	1979600	OK.
1979600	1980600	TX
1980600	1981600	Then we use a bar
1981600	1982600	to represent its
1982600	1983600	absolute value
1983600	1984600	to represent its number.
1984600	1985600	Then you can calculate
1985600	1986600	its number
1986600	1987600	is actually about
1987600	1988600	X
1988600	1989600	is the entropy of X.
1989600	1990600	Then its detailed introduction
1990600	1991600	is
1991600	1992600	is actually very simple.
1992600	1993600	You just think about
1993600	1994600	how do I
1994600	1995600	if I randomly generate code words
1995600	1996600	how do I get
1996600	1997600	the red one?
1997600	1998600	Then the probability of it being calculated
1998600	1999600	is about this much.
1999600	2000600	This is high school math
2000600	2001600	can be calculated.
2001600	2002600	Then
2002600	2003600	through the conversion of high school math
2003600	2004600	put this
2004600	2005600	TX
2005600	2006600	on the square
2006600	2007600	you can calculate
2007600	2008600	OK.
2008600	2009600	It actually draws
2009600	2010600	a red circle
2010600	2011600	the probability of a red circle
2011600	2012600	is 2 to the negative n
2012600	2013600	X
2013600	2014600	negative
2014600	2015600	negative
2015600	2016600	negative
2016600	2017600	OK.
2017600	2018600	But
2018600	2019600	the probability of a blue circle
2019600	2020600	is 1.
2020600	2021600	So
2021600	2022600	if you collect
2022600	2023600	all these points
2023600	2024600	the probability of it being added
2024600	2025600	will be 1.
2025600	2026600	So
2026600	2027600	roughly
2027600	2028600	in this circle
2028600	2029600	there are so many
2029600	2030600	so many
2030600	2031600	so many
2031600	2032600	so many
2032600	2033600	so many
2033600	2034600	so many
2034600	2035600	so many
2035600	2036600	so many
2036600	2037600	so many
2037600	2038600	so many
2038600	2039600	so many
2039600	2040600	so many
2040600	2041600	so many
2041600	2042600	so many
2042600	2043600	so many
2043600	2044600	so many
2044600	2045600	so many
2045600	2046600	so many
2046600	2047600	so many
2047600	2048600	so many
2048600	2049600	so many
2049600	2050600	so many
2050600	2051600	so many
2051600	2052600	so many
2052600	2053600	so many
2053600	2054600	so many
2054600	2055600	so many
2055600	2056600	so many
2056600	2057600	so many
2057600	2058600	so many
2058600	2059600	red circles
2059600	2060600	OK.
2060600	2061600	So
2061600	2062600	now
2062600	2063600	my goal is
2063600	2064600	to not to
2064600	2065600	let these
2065600	2066600	rising circles overlap
2066600	2067600	so
2067600	2068600	that
2068600	2069600	I can
2069600	2071600	can
2071600	2072600	can
2072600	2073600	can
2073600	2074600	can
2074600	2075600	let these two
2075600	2076600	come in
2076600	2077600	which is
2077600	2078600	h of
2078600	2079600	entropy of y
2079600	2080600	minus entropy of y given x
2080600	2081600	so
2081600	2082600	by definition
2082600	2083600	this thing
2083600	2084600	my R
2084600	2085600	is
2085600	2086600	less than
2086600	2087600	or equal to
2087600	2088600	the mutual information
2088600	2089600	of x and y
2089600	2090600	like this
2090600	2091600	OK.
2091600	2092600	Of course we can
2092600	2093600	improve
2093600	2094600	but it's just
2094600	2095600	a loose statement
2095600	2096600	we can
2096600	2097600	improve
2097600	2098600	to prove
2098600	2099600	that
2099600	2100600	this
2100600	2101600	this
2101600	2102600	way of
2102600	2103600	decoding
2103600	2104600	can be
2104600	2105600	as small as
2105600	2106600	we want
2106600	2107600	OK.
2107600	2108600	OK.
2108600	2109600	So
2109600	2110600	OK.
2110600	2111600	So
2111600	2112600	is this
2112600	2113600	the most mathematical part
2113600	2114600	of the whole talk
2114600	2115600	and
2115600	2116600	then
2116600	2117600	then
2117600	2118600	I don't know
2118600	2119600	if there is any
2119600	2120600	question
2120600	2121600	here
2121600	2122600	OK.
2122600	2123600	OK.
2123600	2124600	OK.
2124600	2125600	OK.
