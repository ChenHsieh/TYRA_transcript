00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Thank you very much to the host and thank you very much to the audience for coming today to enjoy the light, and then I am Bo Xuan, and then I am going to talk about the topic here, although there are several English words here, but I think maybe if you are not doing economics, maybe these words, each word guess out what it means, but together do not know what it means, so I will slowly explain that is anyway, the editor will slowly know what I am doing.

00:29.000 --> 00:47.000
What am I doing? Let's start by explaining the topic. First of all, what we are doing is games, so this is the game. I want to use a few minutes to briefly introduce what the theory of the game is, which is a more scientific introduction.

00:47.000 --> 01:01.000
First of all, what is a game? In fact, when you see the game, you may think of online games, table tennis, scissor-paper, or something like that.

01:01.000 --> 01:14.000
In fact, these are all included in this range. For us, the game is actually a mathematical way to describe a strategic environment where we are interacting with people.

01:14.000 --> 01:33.000
As I just said, it actually contains a lot of different situations, such as describing what we eat in our daily life, and we don't know what to eat, so we use scissor-paper to decide. This can also be described, or more complicated, such as a game of Go, which may not be able to play all day.

01:33.000 --> 01:54.000
In fact, it can also be described in such a game theory. It is very comprehensive, but basically it can be divided into two categories in our game. First of all, the first category is Normal Form. I'm not sure what Chinese should be called. Maybe it's called formal expression, but I'll just call it Normal Form.

01:54.000 --> 02:13.000
In the Normal Form, all the players involved in the game all make a move at the same time. It's like scissor-paper. So if you don't know what I'm talking about, you can imagine the environment of scissor-paper. Everyone makes a move at the same time.

02:13.000 --> 02:30.000
The other situation is what I'm going to talk about today, which is Extensive Form. All players make a move at the same time. It's like Go. Everyone makes a move, and then I make a move, and then someone else makes a move. Basically, the game can be divided into these two categories.

02:30.000 --> 02:55.000
Now I'm going to introduce the basic mathematical definition of these two categories. The following two videos are a bit dry. If you have any questions, you can ask me right away if you don't understand the mathematical symbols. First of all, let's look at Normal Form, which is the situation where everyone makes a move at the same time. In this situation, we can actually use three things in mathematics to define it.

02:55.000 --> 03:10.000
First of all, we need to have a collection to say how many players there are now. For example, if two people are playing scissor-paper with me and Gao Xian, then this N is 1 and 2. 1 is me, 2 is Gao Xian.

03:10.000 --> 03:31.000
Next, we need to describe how many moves each person can make. So at this time, for each player i, I will use si to express the number of moves he can make. For example, in scissor-paper, everyone has three moves.

03:32.000 --> 03:45.000
Next, we collect all the people who can make a move into an array. For example, if there are N people, I will collect them into A1 to AN. Then we call it a strategy combination.

03:46.000 --> 04:01.000
Next, the third thing is that I know what strategy combinations there are, and I know how many people are playing. Next, I have to decide who wins and who loses. In this case, we need to use a function to express it. At this time, we call it a payoff function.

04:01.000 --> 04:24.000
So for each player i, this UI is actually a combination of moves from everyone to how many rewards you can get. For example, in scissor-paper, we are playing with Gao Xian. If I make scissors and he makes paper, I win. So in this strategy combination, what I get is 1 and what Gao Xian gets is 0.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
It's like this. You can use these three elements to express a strategy environment where you make a move at the same time.

04:31.000 --> 04:55.000
In math, we want to predict what kind of result people will play in this situation. The mathematical prediction we proposed is basically that the most likely result to be played should be the most stable result. At this time, we use a concept called balance to say what is the most likely result.

04:56.000 --> 05:10.000
The concept of balance is actually that it is defined on a strategy combination. We will say that a certain strategy combination is a balance, which means that for each player, if I know what he does, I am not willing to change the move.

05:10.000 --> 05:31.000
So in this case, it means that this is a balance. So if it is expressed mathematically, we say that a strategy combination A is a simple strategy balance, which means that for each player, he actually uses this A-I, which means that it is a move used by players other than I.

05:32.000 --> 05:45.000
So in this case, it means that player I uses this A-I, which is actually better than any other move for his revenge. If this is true for each player, then we say that this is a simple strategy balance.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
I want to stop for a few seconds, do you have any questions? If not, I will continue to talk about another part.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
OK, then I will continue.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
What we have just finished talking about is Normal Form. Next, we will talk about Extensive Form, which is the situation where everyone takes turns to make moves.

06:06.000 --> 06:22.000
So at this time, you think that it is actually very similar to the previous Normal Form in terms of mathematical structure. It is the same as having a combination to describe how many players there are. In addition, we also need a combination to describe the moves that everyone can make.

06:22.000 --> 06:35.000
But now everyone takes turns to make moves, so now there are three things left to describe. The first is who does what in what place.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
So this means that we have to describe all possible situations, and then in this case, who does what and what he can do.

06:42.000 --> 06:54.000
There are several different mathematical expressions, but here I use a more common mathematical expression to describe what I just said.

06:54.000 --> 07:07.000
First of all, when talking about these notations, if you think there are a lot of mathematical symbols, you can imagine that this is a game of Go. Now N is 1 and 2, that is, there are black stones and white stones.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
Then S is all possible places, so if it is a 19x19 chessboard, there are 361 possible points.

07:15.000 --> 07:25.000
The next first one is that we are describing all possible situations, which is actually all the chess pieces that are still in progress.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
That is, you may play half of the chess pieces or the chess pieces that have been played. We use a set called H, which actually represents history.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
This combination describes all possible situations, that is, half of the chess pieces, etc. I collect them all in this combination.

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
So this combination is actually very large, and then each element in this combination actually means that the previous experience has been put in order.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
For example, the first step of the black stone line is in Tianyuan, which is an element in the history, and now the white stone has put down another hand.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
These things will be collected in this history.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
There is a relatively small set Z in this history set, and we call it Terminal History.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
So this is all the chess pieces that have been played, and I put them in this set.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Because by the time our revenge is based on this set.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
The second thing we have to decide is who is doing what in what situation.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
First of all, who is it?

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
That is to say, it is actually a function P, and then this function is from all possible chess pieces that have not been played.

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
In the chess piece, it is printed to the player's collection, which means that this move should be the turn of the black chess or the white chess.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So this is P, this function is helping us.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Then the third thing is what.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
That is, in every situation, I know that this person is now the turn of the black chess.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
What actions can be done?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Then I will use Row as a Correspondence to describe.

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
What he printed here is a piece of paper from the history set to a possible action set.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
It means that this description says what I can do now.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Then how do we decide who wins and who loses?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It is the same as using our familiar UI to show.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Like this thing, it is a function from a final outcome Z to a ten-digit line.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
For example, if it is in Go, I look at the chess pieces I play.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
If someone's D is bigger, who wins?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
This is how we describe the game.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Then in this case, we have the same theoretical prediction.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Then our theoretical prediction here is actually using a concept.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
It is also balanced, but it is actually called perfectly balanced.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Then in this case, it is everyone's strategy.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
It is actually in every situation where you can move.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
This means that it is from each H, and then it is the turn of the player I to do the action.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Printed to say that you can do the action here.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
So a strategy is equal to telling me that every time it's my turn to move, what action do I want to do?

10:13.000 --> 10:21.000
When I know what everyone's strategy is, I say that a strategy set is perfectly balanced.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
It means that it is balanced in every history.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
In this case, this is a little bit more balanced than the previous mathematical concept.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I know very well that the first few minutes are actually very boring.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Because it is actually just defining math.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
But it may become more interesting later.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Because I started talking about some more real-world games.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I just want to stop here for a few seconds.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I want to make sure that the audience has any questions.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
If there is no problem, then I will continue.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
What I just said is actually a 10-minute version of Crash Course.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
The next thing I want to talk about is Behavioral Game Theory.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
In other words, we think about whether this game predicts people's behavior well or not.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Basically, we are thinking about whether it is balanced to predict people's behavior well.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
This is the most important question in Behavioral Game Theory.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
At this time, we can consider a game first.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
This is called a mystery game.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
This game is actually a game proposed by Keynes in the 1930s.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
At this time, you can imagine that there was a mystery game.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Imagine that there are six bonus points left in the final of the mystery game.

11:46.000 --> 11:55.000
Then they will publish the photos of the six bonus points on the newspaper.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
At this time, in order to increase the exposure of everyone, the newspaper held a lottery.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
The lottery is to see the photos of the six bonus points.

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
Please choose who will be the most popular person in this lottery.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Who is the most popular person to vote for?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
At this time, if you are participating in the lottery,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
you are actually thinking about something in your head.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
It's not about which bonus point is the most handsome or beautiful.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
What you are thinking about is how others will think which one is the most handsome or beautiful.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
So this means that you are not thinking about what he absolutely thinks,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
but at the same time you are thinking about what others think.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
At the same time, when you think so, others will also think that you will think so about me.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Should I also think about it based on this matter?

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
How should others think about me?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
So this is what Keynes described as the stock market.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
When everyone is buying and selling stocks,

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
they don't really care about how good this company is,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
but what they care about is how others evaluate these companies.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
If I can make money, if others evaluate this company well,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
should I consider doing business at this time?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Something like this.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Next, I'm going to talk about a game version.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
So the audience can play this game with me later.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Let's imagine that there are 11 people in this chat room.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
So imagine that we play this game together.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
N is equal to 11.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
The process of this game is that everyone chooses an integer from 0 to 100 at the same time.

13:37.000 --> 13:46.000
The winner of this game is the person who chooses the number closest to the average of two-thirds of all people.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
The person with the closest number is the winner of this game.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Although I can't see everyone,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
but if you are interested, you can take a pen and paper.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'll give you a few seconds to think about it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
If we play this game together here,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
what number would you like to choose?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Anyway, let's think about it a little bit.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Then I'll talk about what the theoretical prediction will be.

14:05.000 --> 14:17.000
Okay, I think everyone should have thought about it.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Let me talk about it now.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Anyway, let's think about it first.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
How do you think about this game?

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
How many numbers did you choose?

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Let's take a look at what the theoretical prediction will predict.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
In this case,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
the theoretical prediction will make a very extreme prediction.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
It predicts that the balance of this game is that all players should choose 0.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
This will be a balance.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Think about it.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
If I go to check, this thing is a balance.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It means I'm going to check.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Suppose I know that everyone else chooses 0,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
what should I choose?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Suppose I don't choose 0 today.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
If I change to a number x,

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
In this case, the average of all types will be x divided by 11,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
and then multiplied by 2.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
The person who is closest to this number will win.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Obviously, in this case,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
0 will be closer to my target number than x.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So it means that if I choose any number,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
it will only make me lose.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
So it means that I have to choose 0.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
If you go through some mathematical checks,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
you will find that this balance is actually the only balance in this game.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
So this is basically a very extreme theoretical prediction.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
Let's take a look at how everyone actually plays.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
This is the first person to do this experiment in 1995.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Then he found this.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I think it's quite a change.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
It's a picture of the whole behavior game theory.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
This is the first experimental data just described.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Then you can see that this is the actual distribution of data.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Then he found that in this case,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
no one chose theoretical prediction.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
This means that the theoretical prediction of 0

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
is not a very good model for explaining data.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
You can also see that there are some particularly prominent points here.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
For example, there are 33 and 22 here,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
which are some particularly prominent numbers.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
This experimental data has been constantly replicated since 1995.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
It has been constantly replicated all over the world.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
This is a very, very stable result.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
You can see that basically no one will choose 0 anywhere.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
Then you can see that a lot of people choose 50, 33, 22, or 10.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
So he wanted to say that this balance

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
may not be a good description of the situation of such data.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
So because of this data,

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
we inspired another model to take over to explain behavior.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
This model is called Level K.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
The Level K model actually assumes that everyone

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
can only think of a certain number,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
just a few layers.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
This model assumes that everyone can think of different levels.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
The beginning of everything is the level 0 people.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Level 0 people mean that

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
he was stupid when he saw this game.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
He didn't even know what number I should choose in this game.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
So this model assumes that

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
these people pick a random number from 0 to 100.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Anyway, it's completely unstrategic.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
He just picked one at random.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
What about Level 1 people?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
He would like to say OK.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
He assumes that other people are all Level 0.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
So today he wants to respond in the most appropriate way.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Other players are all Level 0 people.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
At this time, he will calculate OK.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
In this case,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
if other people are all Level 0,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
then my expected value is average.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
The expected value of the number I chose for other people should be 50.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
So I want to choose 2 out of 50,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
which is the number 33.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Next,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Level 2 people will assume that

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
other people are all Level 1.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
So other people will choose 33.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Then I have to choose 2 out of 33,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
which is 22.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So it goes on and on.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Because of this,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
the Level K model can basically explain

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
the information that appears here.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Here you can see that

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
a lot of people are at a lower density.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
They may be Level 0 Uniform.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Then you can see that

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
there is a peak here,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
which means that

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
a lot of people may be Level 1.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Then there is a large density near 22.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
They may be people who want to be Level 2.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
So...

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Excuse me.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
But why...

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
For example, I am a Level N person.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Why do I have to assume that

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
everyone is exactly the same

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
as Level 1?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Can't I assume that there is no distribution?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, that's a very good question.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because this is another thing that

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
we are going to deal with in this article.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
We will talk about it soon.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But thank you.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This is just a simple introduction

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
to the whole process of file development.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
This is the first version of the model.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But next,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
with this model,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
although it is mentioned by Yan Yong just now,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
this model actually

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
makes some very strong assumptions.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
For example, people who choose N times

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
assume that everyone chooses N-1.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But at least this model

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
can actually explain a lot of

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
strategic behavior in the case of Normal Form.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But if you go back again,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
imagine that at the beginning,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
in the case of Eccentric Form,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
there is no model

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
that is similar to

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Hierarchical Thinking.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Our goal in this paper

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
is to propose

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
a concept of the same solution

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
on Eccentric Form,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
which is also a model

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
of layered thinking.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is probably my introduction.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
In addition to Yan Yong's question,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I will answer it right away.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Do other listeners have any questions?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
If not,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I will continue.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Next, let's talk about

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
our model.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Let's imagine

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
why the

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Level K model

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
is directly linked to

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
the Eccentric Form.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
At this time,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
the Level K model

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
defines the situation

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
where everyone makes a move at the same time.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
In other words, the original Level K model

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
does not consider

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
the past behavior of others

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
and should update my own

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
thoughts on others.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It did not build it

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
into this model.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That is to say,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
when you face a situation

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
where you make a move at the same time,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
this model can be used.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
But when you face a situation

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
where others make a move in turn,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
the Level K model

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
predicts how smart

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
you should be.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
The next logical question

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
is that we can look at

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
this simple example.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Let me use this tree

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
to briefly explain and then

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
respond to some definitions of

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
the Eccentric Form Game.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Basically, we have a

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
H that defines all the chess pieces.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
H here actually describes the

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
whole tree.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Here, each top point

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
tells us where each decision

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
is made.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
The P function tells me

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
who is in charge of

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
each top point.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Let's assume that

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Gao Xian and I are playing this game.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Gao Xian is the second player,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and I am the first player.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Sorry, the host has been cued by me.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
But it doesn't matter.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
If Gao Xian is a person

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
who can think of four layers,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
he will think that

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Bo Xian can think of three layers.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
If Bo Xian can think of

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
one or two layers,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
he will choose A

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
at the beginning.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
If Bo Xian can think of three layers,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
he will choose B.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
If Bo Xian can think of

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
four layers,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
he will think that

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Bo Xian must think of three layers.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
So in this situation,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
he will definitely choose B.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Then I will definitely

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
go to the right branch.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
But if you find out

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
that Bo Xian chose A,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
then this situation

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
is a

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
incompatible situation

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
in terms of

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
how many layers

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
you want to think of.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
This means that

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I think Bo Xian wants to think of three layers,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
so I must be on the right side.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But today it happened on the left side.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
This is a problem that

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
may occur if you

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
look at it carefully.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
If you look at

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
this incompatibility,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
you will find that there are actually two problems.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
The first one is what Yan Yong just mentioned.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
All players

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
assume that others are one level less than him.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This means that

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Gao Xian thinks of four layers,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
but he does not think of other possibilities.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Bo Xian may not be so smart.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
He may not only think of three layers,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
he may only think of two layers or one layer.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So this is a problem with the original model.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
So he can't be directly

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
integrated into the game.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Another problem is

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
when you see the actions of others,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
you should update

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
your evaluation of others.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
For example, in this game,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
if Gao Xian sees

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
the left side,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
then he should immediately notice

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
that Bo Xian is definitely not thinking of three layers.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But this behavior

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
is not built

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
in the original static model.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
So these two things

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
are the two points

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
that our model wants to break through.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
At the same time, we have to deal with these two problems.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Next,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
let's talk about our model.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
First of all,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
this is a place that Yan Yong mentioned.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
How do we deal with the first point?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The first point is

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
the Cognitive Hierarchy Approach.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
After these two words came out,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
they finally put the whole

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
topic together.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
This Cognitive Hierarchy Approach

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
is a

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
advanced version of the Level K model.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It was introduced after 9 years

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
of Level K.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
The operation process of this model is as follows.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Every player

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
will have a level

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
at the beginning.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Then everyone

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
draws this level independently

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
from the probability distribution.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
At this time,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Level K players no longer assume

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
that everyone is just Level K-1.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
He assumes that everyone

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
may be Level 0, may be Level 1,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
or may be from O to

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Level K-1.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
So these are all possible.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Next,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Level K players

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
may mistakenly think that everyone

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
is from Level 0 to Level K-1.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
However,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
their evaluation of others is not so wrong.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
That is,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
their evaluation is at least

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
correct.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
For those who are less than

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
my level,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
their relative proportion

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
is correct.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Next,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
from a mathematical point of view,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
we can use

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Mu ij to express this thing.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Mu is

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
a probability density.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
This is

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
the evaluation of

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Player i and Player j.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The K on the top

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
means that

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Level K player i's evaluation of Player j.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
At this time,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
L is the probability

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
of Player j being L.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
If L is

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
greater than or equal to K,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
it means that

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
others can think at least the same level as me

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
or be smarter than me.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
In this model,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
if you are a Level K player,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
you will feel that

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
you are smarter than me.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
At this time, I put 0 as the probability density.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
But if L is strictly

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
less than K,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
the probability density

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
is the same as

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
the real probability distribution.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
The only difference is that

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I have re-normalized it.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It is re-normalized by

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Level 0 to Level K-1.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
At this time,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
these players are not so smart

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
in our model.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It is possible that

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
everyone is smart.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
It assumes that

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
others think less than you,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
but their ideas

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
are not so wrong.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It is because

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
the overall distribution of others is correct.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
At this time,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
players have truncated rational expectations.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You can observe

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
that when we

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
do a direct exercise,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
when K is infinitely large,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
you can see that

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
in this expression,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
the ratio will be 1,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
because the probability distribution

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
is 1.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
This means that

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
you can have

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
fully rational expectations.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
But if you

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
only think about K,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
you only have a partial

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
evaluation of other people's ideas.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
If you have

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
some questions

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
about K,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
we can discuss later.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
But this article

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
is like this.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It is an extension of Level K.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
We can

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
deal with the first problem,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
that is,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
every player's

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
idea of ​​Level is a fixed point.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Next,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
we will deal with how to update the message.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
At this time,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
we assume that

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
every history shot

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
will update its

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
after-effects probability,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and then use Bayes' law

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to update the after-effects probability.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This means that

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I can keep updating my

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
evaluation of others,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and then I use

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
other people's past behavior

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
to update my evaluation.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
When you make this assumption,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
you will immediately face

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
a problem,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
that is, if the

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
after-effects probability is

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
0,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
then the after-effects probability

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
will not be well-defined.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
In fact,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
there are many articles

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
dealing with

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
0 after-effects probability.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
However,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
there is no such problem

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
in this model.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
The reason is

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
that no matter

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
what level you are,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
you will have a certain chance

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
to think that the other person is

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
level 0.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
When it comes to doing things,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
people at level 0 will choose

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
at will.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
In every

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
history, you will think

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
that this thing is possible,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
because at least there is a level 0,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
he will choose there.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
That is to say,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
my after-effects probability

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
is well-defined.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
All players

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
simply respond

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
to my belief

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
correctly.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
If you can understand

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
this part,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
basically you have understood

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
our model.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
To review a little more,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
let's go back to the example

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
just now.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
At this time,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
let's take a look at what

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
our model is doing.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
We use this vector

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
to show

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
his evaluation of me.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Because he thinks I may be level 0,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
level 1, level 2, level 3.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Four elements are enough

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
to express this probability density.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So today,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
when the model sees

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
that I chose A at the beginning,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
let's compare

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
the three models

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
he gave us.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
He assumes

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
that all players

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
can think of A as four elements,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
but he thinks B must be three elements.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
So anyway,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
he only puts the probability density at level 3.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Because of this,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
you can immediately see

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
the incompatibility problem.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Now let's take a look

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
at what he will give me

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
if we use the 2004 model.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
At this time,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
we can see

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
that the 2004 model

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is also a static model.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Therefore,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
his evaluation of others will not be updated.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
He always thinks that others

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
work with truncated rational expectation.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So his evaluation afterwards

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
is always assuming

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
that others are level 0 to level 3.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So his denominator is 0 plus 3.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Then his denominator

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
is just 0, 1, 2, 3.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So this is just starting

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
from the real distribution.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Assuming that others

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
only have the possibility of 0 to 3.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Next,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
let's talk about

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
the possibility of his evaluation

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
in our model.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
First of all,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
when the high-level player

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
sees that I chose A,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
he will start to think

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
why I chose A.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
He will think

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
that there are several possibilities.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
The first one is

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
that Boxuan is actually a level 0

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
and he is fooling around.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
So if he is level 0,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I have half a chance to choose left

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and half a chance to choose right.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So if I am level 0,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I have half a chance to choose left.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The other possibility is that

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Boxuan may be level 1 or level 2.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
So all the possibilities

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
appear on the left are put in the denominator,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
which is one-half of P0 plus P1 plus P2.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
The above is

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
what Bayes' law tells us.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
We can observe the after-effects probability.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We know that

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
under this sub-game,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
the high-level player can immediately

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
rule out the possibility that Boxuan is level 3.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Because if he is level 3,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I will definitely be in another sub-game.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
But now I'm here.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
This means that

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
when I calculate the after-effects probability,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I will completely kill him.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
This is basically the illustration

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
of Bayes' law.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You can pause for a moment.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
If you have any questions,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I just saw a question in the chat room.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Let me take a look.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Oh,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
here is

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Thank you

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Yi Ouyang.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
He asked a question.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
What assumption did we make

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
on the probability density?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
We actually assumed

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
that each PK is greater than 0.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
This assumption is

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
without loss of generality.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Thank you.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
But here we assume that

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
there is full support.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
OK.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Then

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I will continue.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Thank you very much for the question.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Next,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
this is a bit technical.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
But let me introduce a little bit.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Under this model setting,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
what general rules

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
do we have?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
First of all,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
under any extensible game,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
let's say there are many people today.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Let's say it's me and Gao Xian today.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Then add a mysterious player X.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Let's say there are three people playing.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
This theorem tells us that

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
if there are more than two people today,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
the after-effects probability

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
in each place

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
is actually a

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
joint probability

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
of each player.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
This theorem tells us that

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
no matter where you are,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
the joint probability of your after-effects

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
will be

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
independent of each player.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
This also means that

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
what others did,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
like what X did,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
will not affect my evaluation of Gao Xian.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
What Gao Xian did

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
will not affect my evaluation of X.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Then the second theorem,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
in fact, we can see

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
that when this game

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
becomes longer and longer,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I will have more evidence

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
to know which level

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I am.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
So next,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I think the other person

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
has fewer and fewer

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
possibilities.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
This means that when the history

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
becomes longer,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
my support will be smaller and smaller.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
The third one is

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
that

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
we think that

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
there is a model solution

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
under this model.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Because you can see that

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
when K becomes infinitely large,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
people have fully rational expectations.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
In this situation,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
people will naturally ask

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
whether our model

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
will choose to be balanced

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
when K becomes infinitely large.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
The answer is not necessarily.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
In other words,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
if K does not choose to be balanced,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
it has nothing to do with logic.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
In other words,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
we can find an example

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
that K will choose to be balanced,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and we can also find an example

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
that K will never choose to be balanced.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
So this is a more general definition.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
This is a more technical result.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But I just listed it here.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I won't say much.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
The above is actually

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
more like a pure mathematical model

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
in my eyes.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
There are many different ideas

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
about science.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
But at least in my opinion,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
if a model is a good model,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
it can be

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
detected

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
or denied

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
by actual data.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
In the current situation,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
what we have found

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
is actually a mathematical solution,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and it is a bit

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
too general.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
So we can't find

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
any more

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
falsifiable theoretical predictions.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So next,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
in order to get some predictions

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that we can test in practice,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
let's consider

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
the following very specific decision situation.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
OK, let's consider

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the following game.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
There are two people here.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Let's change someone today.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Let's play with Yan Yong.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
OK, let's play the game.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Today's game is

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
take turns.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
At the beginning,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
you can imagine it as an investment game.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
We are going to raise a...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
For example,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
you can say watermelon, pumpkin,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
or electronic chicken.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
But at the beginning, the size is one unit.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Then every day,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
we take turns to feed it,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
water it, or invest.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Every day,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
everyone can do two actions.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Either I decide to take,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I want to take this chicken,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
or I want to harvest this pumpkin.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
If I decide to harvest,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
the person who decides to harvest

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
can divide it into a larger part,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and the person who is harvested

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
can take a smaller part.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
At the same time,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
you have another option every day.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I can invest C dollars

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
into this.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
For example, you water this pumpkin

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and let it grow today.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Or you decide to take this electronic chicken.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Then this game is over.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
According to the distribution we said,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
divide this thing.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But if you decide to invest,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
this is actually a

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
strategic risk.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's a strategic risk action.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Because

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
if you choose to invest,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
you have an advantage that

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
you can make this thing bigger.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But your disadvantage is

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
that the next day it's someone else's turn to decide.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
You have to decide to take

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
or continue to invest.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
So if you think

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
if someone else wants to invest,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you may think that I will invest today.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But if you think you want to take today,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
if you think you want to take tomorrow,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
you may think you want to take today.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Because if someone else takes it,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
someone else will get a bigger part tomorrow,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
and you will get a smaller part.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So there is a trade-off here.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
But this is just a big concept of the game.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
There will be a more detailed introduction later.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
This game is actually called

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
the centripetal game.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Before I introduce the centripetal game,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I will respond to

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Yi Ouyang's question.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Yes, this is

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
common knowledge.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Everyone knows the distribution of odds.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Thank you for your question.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I will continue to talk about the centripetal game.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Why is this thing called

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
centripetal game?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
If you draw it as a tree map,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
it looks like a centripetal game.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It's just because of this.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
The view of this tree map is like this.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
At the beginning,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Player 1 does things.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
If he decides to take it at the beginning,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
he takes 1 and others take 0.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
But on the first day,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
he can also decide to pass.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
If he passes,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
this thing becomes C,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
which increases the unit of C.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
So if it's Player 2's turn on the second day,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Player 1 can only take C.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Player 2 can take 1 plus C.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Player 2 can decide to pass or take.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
If Player 2 decides to pass,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
it's my turn on the third day.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
So you can imagine that

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
if I take this on the third day,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
my odds become 1 plus 2C.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Then others

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
can only take 2C.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
So in this case,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
let's assume that

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
we have a total of 2S days.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So everyone can do S actions.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
This is just a

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
technical assumption.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Let's assume that

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
every increase of C

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
is between 1 to 1.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
This assumption

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
is not a very strict assumption.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
We just make this thing

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
become an interesting question.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
You can imagine that

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
if C is too big,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
everyone will keep passing.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So it's not interesting.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
If C is too small,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
everyone will

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
just take it.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It's too trivial.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
So we consider

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
a more interesting range.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
In these assumptions,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
we can see

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
how everyone

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
will play this game.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Here is a balanced prediction.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Everyone

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
has to take

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
as long as he can do actions.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
So we can go back and check

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
the definition of balance.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That is to say,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
everyone has to do the best actions

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
in every history.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So let's go back one by one.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Let's look at the last day.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's the second person's turn.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
He can decide

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
whether to take or pass.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
If I take,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
I can take 1 plus 2S-1

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
times C.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
But if I decide to pass,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I am 2SC.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
In this case,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
for the last day,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
player 2 wants to

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
take.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
It's more profitable to take.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
So if we go back

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
to the last day,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
if player 1 knows

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
that player 2 will take the next day,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
after the same calculation,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
player 1 will think it's better to take.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
If it's player 2's turn

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
on the second day,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
player 2 will also think it's better to take.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
We can see that

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
the perfect balance

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
predicts an extreme result.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
No matter how long the game is,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
no matter how big C is,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
between 1 to 1.3,

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
player 2 will always take.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
So no matter how long the game is,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
it won't continue.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Let's think about this.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Excuse me.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
My question is

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
that you said

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
you wanted to do an experiment.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
When you finished

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the theory part,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I wanted to ask

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
if you wrote a Monte Carlo

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
to see how it would look like.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
For example,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
how many people play,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
how many Cs,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
what would the face space look like?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Your question is really good.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
You are a worm in my stomach.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
This is something that will appear

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
after a few videos.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Sorry.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Sorry, everyone.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
My worm is talking again.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm familiar with him,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
so he knows what I'm going to say.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
So I just want to introduce

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
the game environment.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Next, let's see

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
why we choose Centipede Game.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
First of all,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
this...

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Sorry, I just laughed.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
The interesting thing about

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
the centipede game is

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
that it has been experimented for 30 years.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Then we thought

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
we should find an environment

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
where the existing theory is not good,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
so that there is room for new theory development.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Let's take a look now.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
For those who are

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
unfamiliar with this experiment,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I would like to explain a little bit

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
what the data of this experiment will look like.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Let's say we are now

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
not good at math. Let's say we only have 10 people.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
If there are 10 people,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
let's do the experiment.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
The experimenter will randomly

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
pair two people and pair two people.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
So there are five teams here.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
So after each team starts playing this game,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
my observation

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
is that a team of players will have an observation value,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
which is the day

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
they decided

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
to take it.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
So this is the observation value,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
which is my terminal period.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Our balanced prediction

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
is a degenerate distribution,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
that is, all the probability densities

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
will be placed on the first day.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But in fact,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
in 1992,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
this was the first experiment

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
my boss did,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
he found that only 1% of people

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
would choose to be balanced.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
This means that balancing in this situation

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
is not a good prediction.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
In fact, it should be a pretty bad prediction.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
The first reason is

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
that the actual behavior

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
is very, very far

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
from the existing balanced theory.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So people may think that

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
our theory has room to play.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
At the same time,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
we are dealing with this environment.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
In fact, there is a purpose that is one more than two times.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Because in the past 30 years,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
this is a no-fail game.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
In fact, it has been repeated

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
many times.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
But there are two possible

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
methods in the experiment.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
One is to use the extensive form,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
that is, I ask everyone once

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
whether you want to take it or pass it today.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
The other is to ask other people

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
if you know that other people want to pass it,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
do you want to take it or pass it?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
So this is what I ask one after another.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
But the same experiment,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
you can also ask another question.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
My other approach is

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I directly ask

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
how many days do you want to take

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and I ask another person

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
how many days do you want to take.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So these two things,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
many people are arguing

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
whether these two questions

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
are still under debate.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
So because of this,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
we are going to talk about

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
theoretical prediction.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
It is not only testable,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
but we also want to solve

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
a big debate

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
in the method theory of

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
experimental economics.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
This is why we choose martial arts.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Next, before I start talking about

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
my theoretical prediction,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I will briefly explain

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
what these two methods look like.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
This example is a six-legged centipede.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
There are two people,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
so there are six stages here.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So in Extensive Form,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
you can look at the above picture.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I just simply ask the first person

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
if you want to take it or pass it,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and then I ask the second person

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
if you want to take it or pass it.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
At the same time,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I can also ask him

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
how many decisions

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
do you want to make

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
when you decide to take it.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Take the first time means

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I want to take it on the first day.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Take the second time means

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I want to pass it on the first day,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
and I want to take it on the second day.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
The second option is

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I want to take it on the third day.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The third option means

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I want to take it on the fifth day

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
or I want to pass it on forever.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
So for both players,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
they have four choices.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So these two methods

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
have balanced predictions.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Theoretically,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
no matter what form you use

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
to play this game,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
you have to take it on the first day.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So under these two methods,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
theoretical prediction

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
is the same as

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Degenerate Distribution.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
All probability densities are placed on the first day.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
But our model predicts

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
that the results of these two methods

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
will be different.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
The following is

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
our article

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
on the most difficult to prove theorem.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
The following is the theorem.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
For any centripetal game,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you can see that

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
in our current centripetal game,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
there are two parameters that can determine

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
the centripetal game.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
The first is c,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
which is how much weight

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
this centripetal can increase

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
every time.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
The second is s,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
which is how many feet this centripetal has.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The theorem is for any c and s.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
It is a theorem for any

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
prior to the level.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it is a theorem for any

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
prior to the level.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Now, let's say I do an experiment today.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I randomized

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
my method of doing the experiment.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I randomized that some people

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I use NormalFoam to play.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Some people use ExtensiveFoam.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
The result I get is

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
that under NormalFoam,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I can find a probability density function

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
or calculate the cumulative probability density function.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Then I can also find out the cumulative probability density function

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
under ExtensiveFoam.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Then the next theoretical prediction is

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
that the cumulative probability density function

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
under NormalFoam

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
will be First-Order Stochastically Dominate.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
will be First-Order Stochastically Dominate.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
This is the cumulative probability density

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
under ExtensiveFoam.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
This is the cumulative probability density

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
under ExtensiveFoam.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
This theorem can be introduced first.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
What is FOSD?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I thought about it before the speech.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
It seems to be showing me a good example.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
If you don't like it,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
you can leave a message again.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Everyone says that

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
In the exam.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
The scans of this year are harder.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Or simpler than last year.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You can also make a comparison.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
What is the difference?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
The first order esperiential

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
is faster this year.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
First Order Stochastically Dominate

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I believe this theorem shows

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm looking at the top, front,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
middle, back, bottom.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
If my top score is 70 last year,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I will be 80 this year.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
If my front score is 65 last year,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I will be 70 this year.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So it's more than every score.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
In fact, it is the corresponding score

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
for each PR value.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
If this year's score is higher than last year's,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
then this year's score is relatively simple.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
In the sense of FOSD.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So if you change it to

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
cumulative probability density,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
it will look like this.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
If the red line is FOSD,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
the blue line means that

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
the red line will always be pressed

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
under the blue line.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Or the red line will be

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
on the right side of the blue line.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
The next question is

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
what our theoretical prediction

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
will look like in this situation.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Here is a simple example.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
If you have four corners,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
your possible terminal node

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
is the first, second,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
third, fourth day,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
or the last day,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
so it's the fifth day.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
So there are five possibilities.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
The blue one is

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
the result of our dynamic CH prediction.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The red line is

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
the result of our

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
theoretical prediction.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
The red line is

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the result of our

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
theoretical prediction.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
The red line is

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
the result of our

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
theoretical prediction.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
No matter where you play,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
no matter what your C and S look like,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
you will always see this relationship.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
The blue line is on the red line.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
So today,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
no matter what your

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Distribution of Levels looks like,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
what you move is just the absolute position

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
of the blue line and the red line.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
But relatively speaking,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
the blue line will always be

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
on the red line.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
So this is our theoretical prediction.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Let's say that

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
each player is playing with

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Extensive Form Game,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
it will be more balanced.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
In a sense,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
they will decide to take earlier.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
So here I want to

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
talk a little bit about

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
why this thing is

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
testable.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Because when I'm doing an experiment today,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I'm in the same group of collectors,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I'm going to randomize,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
some people can play with Normal Form,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
this blue line

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
and the red line

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
are directly what we theoretically

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
see in the data.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
So when we see this next,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
we have a lot of

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
statistical tools to say

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
whether the blue line is

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
significantly different from the red line.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
And we can see that

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
the two of them are FOSD different.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So this is why

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
our experiment results are testable.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Then the second thing is

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
why this theoretical prediction

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
is very good for experimentalists.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
It is also a stress test for us.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Because

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
this theory, although it has a lot of parameters

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
in it at the beginning,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
but in the end our statement is parameter-free,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
that is, it is not related to any function,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
not related to any parameter.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
So the only requirement is

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
that I do randomization

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
in the same group of collectors.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
This means that as an experimenter,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
you can pick a C and S at will.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
So at this time you can say

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
that I want 10 legs for my martial arts,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I want 20 legs,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
and I want to pick 0.5 for my C,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
so I can pick 0.7 and 0.8 at a time.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
In these cases,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
the only change is

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
the shape of blue and red,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
but the relative position is still

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
always here,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
the blue line is always on the red line.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
So it means that for the experimenter,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
he has a lot of freedom.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
And again, because it is

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
all right,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
it means that I do this experiment

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
in Taiwan, or in Europe,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
or in the United States,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
he has to see this.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
So it means that our theory provides

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
a very strong theoretical prediction.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Although it is very, very,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
that is to say,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
if you do it wrong in any way,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
there is no way to present our results,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
it may deny our theory.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
But in other words,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
if I do this experiment,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
it means that our theory

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
is a very, very big support.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
So this is

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
this is

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
we have different statements in paper,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
but this is a more generalized

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
version of a statement.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Then,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
because I think the time is almost up,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
so I might just summarize it a little bit.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Then we will leave some time for Q&A.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
If you have any questions,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
we can meet again,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
we can talk a little bit after five minutes.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
In conclusion,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
what did we do with this model?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
The most important message is that

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
when you see the behavior of others in the past,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
it actually tells you

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
where the progress of the game is now.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
It also tells you

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
how many layers it can think of.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
This message is actually hidden

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
in other people's past behavior.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Then if we say

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
we apply any static model directly,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
whether it is level K or CH model,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
it will actually find that

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
our ideas and the behavior we see

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
may be inconsistent.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
So at this time,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
we use the new model we provide

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
to solve this incompatibility problem.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
For those

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
who do CS computing here,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
we can think about

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
the question that may come to mind

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
is whether this thing is easy to solve.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
In fact, my response is

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
that our model is

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
a very easy thing for the computer.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
The reason is

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
that its code can actually

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
be rewritten with a for loop.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That is to say,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
people at each level

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
actually use the same method to do things.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
When I solve this model,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I first think about people at level 1.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Suppose everyone is level 0.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Then I will solve what is the best thing to do at level 1.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Then people at level 2

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
will look at what level 0 and level 1 are doing.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Then I will explain what these people are doing.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Then I update my belief.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Then I choose what is the best behavior

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Next, people at level 3

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
assume that others are level 1, level 0, level 1, level 2.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Then do the same thing.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
So it is actually a recursive definition method.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It is very easy to solve in math.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
It is very easy to calculate on the computer.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
But relative to the balanced model,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
it is actually solving a fixed point problem.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Because everyone must

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
respond to each other at the same time.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
So at this time,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
it's like you're solving several equations.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
So at this time,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
you may not have chosen the right conditions at the beginning.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
But in our model,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
it is the only one.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And it exists.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And it is very easy to solve.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
So these are some good properties.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
The other part of the article

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
is a very strong

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
theory prediction

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
that can be denied in practice.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
that can be denied in practice.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
That is to say,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
we assume that in a group of the same number,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
you use the extension function to play

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
or the normal function to play

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
, we will find that

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
all the players

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
should take it earlier

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
in the sense of FOSD.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
In the sense of FOSD.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
This is true for any sense of beginning.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
And it is true in any place.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
So this is a very strong assumption.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
So when this assumption

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
can be proven,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
it means that

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
it is a great support for our theory.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
At the end,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
some future prospects

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
can be extended.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
The first one is the experiment.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Now I am thinking with my teacher

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and Wang Daoyi from NTU.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
How do we set up an experiment

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
to verify our strong prediction?

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
The next theory is

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
at least the second point.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
The theory is the second episode

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I am writing now.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It's about the same model.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
In the second article,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I can briefly talk about it,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
but I can't talk much because I don't have much time.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
The first thing to think about

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
is that

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
in this game,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
you will have

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
incomplete information.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It's like playing Dezopuk.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
All the information

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
is the two hand cards

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
on your hand

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
and the card on the table.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
But you don't know

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
what the player's hand card is.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
So in general,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
we can only predict

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
what the player's hand card

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
will look like

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
when he or she decides to play.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
But

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
in our theory today,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
when someone else is going to play

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
or decide to fold,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
can you update

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
if the other player is a good match?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
If the other player

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
just randomly plays,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
you may know that

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you don't have to care about his hand card.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
This should be a level 0.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
This theory already has

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
a building in it, but it's not very tractable.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
So now I'm writing

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
a new theory

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
to discuss this matter.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
In two months,

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I'm going to use this

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
second bullet point to test my candidates.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Then there are other applications.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Our theory

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
is a very general setting.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
It can be applied to a lot of places.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
For example, social learning.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
This may be something like

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
you've never been to a restaurant

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
and you're not sure

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
if the restaurant is good or bad.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
All you see is

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
a group of people queuing up.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
At this time,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
the general theory may be

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
that I only use the behavior of others

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
to update whether this restaurant is good or not.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
But it's very likely

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
that if you see this restaurant

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
queueing up every time,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
but you go to see the medicine,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
many people say it's not ideal.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
At this time,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
you have to update your belief

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
that those people in line

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
may be level 0 people.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
This means that their behavior

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
is not too much

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
in line.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
It's not really

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
how delicious this thing is.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
If our model is applied

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
to social learning,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
a similar situation may occur.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Then you can also apply it to

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
political science, such as voting.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
For example, if you vote for a candidate,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
it's like playing a game with a voter.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
The candidate keeps raising his ID,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and the voter decides

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
whether to vote for him or another person.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So it's very likely that

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
after he raises his ID,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
you update that this candidate

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
may be a level 0 candidate.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Then there may be

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the case of negotiation.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
In any game where you have to take turns

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
to make a move,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
our theory actually applies.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Thank you very much for your participation today.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
You can e-mail me.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If you have any questions,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
you can contact me.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
This article is actually finished.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's already pre-printed.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
If you want to see the draft,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
you can find it on my website.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I will also share this video with you.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I will also put it on the website,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
so you can go and see it.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Next, because this speech

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
is recorded,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you can also find it on Project Tyra.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Thank you very much.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Okay.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Now it should be better.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Okay.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'll say it again.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Thank you very much

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
for Boxuan's speech,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
especially for your detailed explanation

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
to help me understand

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
your theoretical model.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I think because we just

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
opened some Q&A answers

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
in the process,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
because it's still being recorded,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
we can open a few more questions.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I think the Q&A time

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
is divided into two parts.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The first part is to keep recording.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
The second part, I will turn off the recording

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and we will save time.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So now in the process of recording,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I don't know if there are any questions

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
that the audience wants to ask.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
You can look at the microphone yourself.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Someone just asked

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
in the message area,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
did you say In-N-Out hamburger?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I said yes.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
My answer is yes.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I also want to ask a question.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I want to brush up on my sense of presence.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I actually think

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
because you mentioned a lot of

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
detailed explanations,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
so it really helped me.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I actually have a question.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You just mentioned the number guessing game.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
In fact, in the number guessing game,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
I feel that its essence

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
is a bit like

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
there is no competition between players.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
In the later martial arts game,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
what I mean by no competition

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
is that I just have to

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
work hard to guess the correct number.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
In fact, in the later martial arts game,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
there is competition.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And I have to guess

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
that you don't want to

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
win in this round,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
but you are still

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
greedy enough.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So I think there seems to be

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
some fundamental differences

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
between these two games.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So I'm not sure

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
if this is a question

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
of clarification.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But in fact,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
thank you very much for your question.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
There are some differences

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
between these two games.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
First of all,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
because it is a no-attack round 6 move,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and then it is a number guessing game,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
it is a move at the same time.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Secondly,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
in fact,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
because when you are

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
a move at the same time,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
how do you say

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In the end, the winner is

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
the one who is closest to the winner.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So in a way,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the one who is closest to the winner wins.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But his problem is that

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
his payoff does not grow

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
because of what you do.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
If you win, you win. If you lose, you lose.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But in the martial arts game,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
if you two go together,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
you two decide to

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
say that we go together for 10 days

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
and then start playing this game,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
it is true that in a way,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
he will cheat and say that

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I decided to take the lead first.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So it is true that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
his thinking may be different

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
in two games.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But thank you very much for your question.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yes, because it feels like the previous

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
number guessing game

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
because its answer is fixed.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The martial arts game

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
is not fixed.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It follows another person at any time.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So I don't know if these two differences

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
will affect your model settings.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
In fact, it is not very likely

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
because our model is set in a very general situation.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Speaking of this solution,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
if you are interested,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
you can type in the comment area

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
and swipe a row.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It doesn't matter if you are shy.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
We can also talk about

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
what number you chose after the recording.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I am quite curious.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yes, but you can see that

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
it is 25.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Good.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's pretty good.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Then you can choose the number 20.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
50.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
OK.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Anyway, everyone can choose.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
If you are shy, you can talk about it later.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I have a question.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
First of all, Xu Youzhen chose 25.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It's not me.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
The problem is that

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
you make an assumption.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
This assumption is that

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
those who participate in this game

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
will make the most rational

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and best choice.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
The real limitation is that

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
he is not smart enough.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Or we say that his thinking depth is limited.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But like Gao Xian said,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
how do you know that

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
when you really want to implement

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
this experiment to a group of people,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
there will be no bad guys.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Or he deliberately

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
does not follow the rules.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Or he had an accident at home yesterday,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
so his choice of behavior is very strange.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Something like that.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Will this thing be an interesting probe?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Can you take the experiment

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
you want to implement

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
to reverse it?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
If I measured it today,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I can prove that

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
this group of people may have

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
had an accident at home.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Thank you very much for your question.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It sounds a bit noisy,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
but it's actually a very serious question.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The first is that

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
our theory

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
does not say

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
that he may be a

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
setting defect

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
or a model feature.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Our only limitation is that

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
he can't choose

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
the degree of that place.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It's not because he made a mistake,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but because his brain can't think so much.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
In other cases,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
some people deliberately

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
continue to pass on in martial arts.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It is very likely that

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
he is a level 0 person in our model.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
But of course,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
there is another type of people

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
who like to pass on.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So his decision-making behavior

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
is to pass on wherever he meets.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Our model is actually

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
more like a method theory.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Of course, it can be extended

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
to say that I can add

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
other crazy types of people

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
into it.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Our model is also used

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
to simply rewrite

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
how many types there are.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Our model is more like

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
what mistakes they made.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
In fact, I can talk about

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
the fact that

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
some people are thinking about this in

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
experimental economics.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
For example,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
we have a game

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
called the dictator game.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Let's say I play a game with you today.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I have 100 yuan to share.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I decide how much I want to share with you.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You have nothing to say.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'll give you as much money as you want.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
We can use this to

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
measure other people's preferences.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
For example,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
how much other people's preferences

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
are fair to society.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We can use

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
other environments

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
to measure

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
how much

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
other people's preferences

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
are fair to society.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Or

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
there is another game

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
called the final match.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
This game is very similar.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The first person decides

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
how much money I want to give you.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
The second person decides

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
whether to accept this offer or not.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
If he doesn't want it,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
everyone won't take it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
If he accepts it,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
he will use this method.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
We can also use

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
how much money he will give to others

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and whether others will accept it

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
to see what he thinks of others.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
In fact,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
at least in the final match,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
there are other games

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
that try to detect

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
other people's preferences

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
in addition to strategic thinking.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
That's all for now.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Thank you for your questions.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Or we can

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
stop recording and chat later.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Does anyone

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
have any questions

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
before the recording ends?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Can I ask a question?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Sure.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Hello, I am

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Huang Feiyang from Jianqiao University.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I am a neurosurgeon.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I have two questions.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
The first one

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
is more like your extension.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Because it seems that

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
your model depends on

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
assuming that

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
this person knows

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
his level very clearly.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Is there a possibility that

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
he is not sure of his level

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
in terms of distribution?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It sounds like this.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Because I feel that

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
in fact, the detector

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
may not be sure where he is.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
This is the first question.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
The second question is more technical.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
In fact,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
your prediction is that

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
extensive games

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
will be found earlier

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
than normal game.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I want to ask

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
how do you prove FOSD in practice?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Because even if you are poor,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
you can only guess

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
that he may be close to FOSD.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Because if you can't find the antithesis,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
it doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So how much in practice

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
will let you

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
be sure that

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
your inference is correct?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Both questions

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
are very good.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Thank you very much for your question.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Let's do it one by one.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
First,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the technical point is that

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I totally agree with you.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
After all,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
this is the first

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
method in Extensible.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So I think

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
this is totally feasible.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
In fact,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
what I know is that

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
some people's methods

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
in normal game

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
are more like this.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Although everyone

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
has a different level.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It may be different

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
in every game.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But everyone has a capacity.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
No matter how smart I am,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I still play to a certain extent.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
But based on different games

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and different people

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and different opponents,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I have different beliefs.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
In this case,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
the level I may show is different.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
This is another kind of extension.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
But as you just mentioned,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I'm not sure

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
what my level is today.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
In the process of playing the game,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
you will learn several things at the same time.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
First, you will learn

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
how smart you are.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Second, how smart others are.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Third, if there is incomplete information,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
what does the incomplete information

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
of others look like?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
If so,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
you may learn a lot

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
under your model setting.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But I think it's totally feasible.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Thank you for your first question.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Next, let's talk about the second question.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The second question is about the experiment.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I think what you said

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
is right.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We can only say that

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
given the FOSD relationship,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
we can only say that

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
we can only say that

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
given the FOSD relationship,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
we can only say that

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
we can only say that

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
we can only say that

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
we can only say that

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
although FOSD is possible.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
although FOSD is possible.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
how to say

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
any arena

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
any arena

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
The makeup of our team

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
the makeup of our team

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But the meme

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But the meme

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
A rough case

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
A rough case

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
A rough case

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
a rough case

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
A rough case

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
We try our best to pick some extreme cases

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
We try our best to pick some extreme cases

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
If in these cases

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It all shows

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
At least we see that in fact

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Because the blue line and the red line are two CDFs

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
This is a result that can be directly observed in practice

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So if we say

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
In all kinds of extreme situations

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
In all kinds of extreme situations

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
In all kinds of extreme situations

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
We all see the blue line and the red line

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
If there is such a relationship

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Then maybe we can only say

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
We only meet a necessary condition

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
But this does not mean that it is a sufficient condition

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I think what you said is something like this

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It's true that we're just

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
If we pick a C or S

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
If we pick a C or S

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's just to verify that the necessary conditions are met

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
The sufficient conditions may not be right

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
But what we can do

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But what we can do

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The best thing we can do in practice is

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It's like trying to deny our model

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It's like trying to deny our model

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
If we say that we have no way to deny it

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Maybe it can be said that our model is right

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
But how right is it

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It does take more and more

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
How do you explain

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because after all, in many cases

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
When you verify the model

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
You are just verifying the prediction that it can be tested

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So in this case

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
You are based on the model

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Some of the results found

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Let me see if it will meet this thing

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It's like verifying its necessary conditions

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
If this thing is wrong, the model will be counterproductive

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But I think the questions you ask are very good

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I'm not sure if my answer is good

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I'm very sorry

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Thank you very much for your question

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I don't know if I can answer you

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Yes, thank you

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Thank you very much

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
If the answer is not good, you can talk to me later

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Thank you, thank you for your question

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Thank you Boxuan

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I'll turn off the recording right away

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Before turning off the recording

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Do you want to do the last clarification

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
For

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Maybe there will be potential viewers in the future

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Will watch your video

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So do you want to do the final interpretation

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Or concluding remark

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I think it seems

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
But I think I seem to have talked about it

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Because mainly

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I think I have talked about it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Yes yes yes

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
But thank you

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
If there are future viewers who want to watch

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Thank you very much

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Thank you very much for watching

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
No no no

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Thank you Boxuan, I'll turn off the recording now
