0	12000	Oh, maybe I can think about it first. I probably won't provide slides because I know a lot of participants will want slides, but I won't provide slides.
12000	16000	Anyway, there are recordings, so I think it should be fine.
30000	59000	Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.
59000	63000	Taira is a friendly environment for young researchers in Taiwan.
63000	68000	We hold Taira Talk every weekend.
68000	71000	The format and content of this talk are very diverse.
71000	76000	Academic researchers can share their research results here according to their occupations,
76000	80000	and also practice live presentations or meet future potential partners.
80000	88000	Today is the first lecture of the Taira 2022 Overseas Researcher Application Guidelines.
88000	92000	The topic is European Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.
92000	97000	Next week will be the North American Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.
97000	105000	Next week, August 28th, will be two types of application documents, CV and SOP writing skills.
105000	116000	We mentioned in the propaganda file and application form that if you are willing to participate in one-on-one Ph.D. application mentoring,
116000	124000	if you sign up and attend the first or second lecture, plus the third CV and SOP writing lecture,
124000	127000	you will have the opportunity to mentor first.
127000	132000	Let me briefly explain this one-on-one guidance.
132000	138000	This year, we have invited many young scholars with overseas study experience to serve as mentors
138000	143000	to help Taiwanese students prepare for various applications,
143000	146000	such as school consultations, interview preparation, etc.
146000	156000	The mentors selected can apply for mentors according to their own conditions, such as the field of research, the target school, etc.
156000	162000	Then the mentors can choose mentors that are suitable for help according to their personal wishes.
162000	166000	We expect to recruit about 100 mentors this year,
166000	169000	because the registration situation in the past was quite intense,
169000	172000	so if the number of applicants exceeds,
172000	179000	if you participate in this series of lectures in August, you will have the opportunity to mentor first.
179000	185000	So we highly encourage everyone to participate in the third CV and SOP lecture.
185000	191000	At the same time, we also hope that everyone can listen to our other TerraTalks in the future.
191000	194000	We have continued to update the lecture list on our official website.
194000	198000	You are also welcome to follow our Facebook and Instagram.
198000	203000	You can also join the Terra membership for free and enjoy more membership exclusive rights.
203000	206000	You can have more interactions with other mentors.
206000	213000	I will post the registration form for joining the membership in the chat later.
213000	219000	Today's event will issue a Terra badge as a certificate of participation.
219000	223000	This is an NFT, which is a completely open and unalterable record.
223000	226000	For more information, please see the chat link.
226000	230000	To join the certificate, you must first install the PoAP app.
230000	235000	You can first scan the QR code in the chat link to install the PoAP app.
235000	239000	We will announce the password to receive the badge after the lecture.
239000	244000	If your phone cannot install the app, please stay after the lecture.
244000	246000	We will help you solve it.
246000	250000	Later, we will invite two speakers to share their thoughts.
250000	255000	After the lecture, we will have a Q&A session.
255000	257000	Finally, we will issue the NFT.
257000	261000	Today, we welcome the first speaker.
261000	266000	He is Dr. Zhang Zhaoyuan from the University of Dresden.
266000	269000	His field of research is business engineering.
269000	275000	According to Terra's tradition, we will turn on the microphone.
276000	280000	I will end my slideshare.
290000	293000	I will turn on the microphone again.
293000	298000	Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his thoughts.
306000	311000	Thank you for the invitation, Project Terra.
311000	316000	I will share my experience applying for a university in Europe.
316000	319000	I am Zhang Zhaoyuan.
319000	324000	As the host said, I am currently studying my Ph.D. at Dresden.
324000	329000	Before coming to Germany, I studied at Cornell University.
329000	332000	I studied Biomedical Engineering for one year.
332000	336000	I will not talk about the U.S. part of today's talk.
336000	342000	I don't know if you are still hesitating to apply for a university in the U.S. or Europe.
342000	345000	I will leave this part for Q&A.
345000	350000	I have a few slides to share about the difference between the European system and the U.S. system.
350000	356000	As I said, I don't know what your current status is.
356000	361000	If you are still a blank sheet, and don't know how to start your Ph.D.,
361000	366000	I think the most important thing is to ask yourself what your motivation is.
366000	368000	It may sound vague.
368000	371000	I won't teach you how to write a document today.
371000	377000	But your motivation will affect how you write your documents.
377000	382000	Even if you are lucky enough to get an interview offer, you will be asked.
382000	385000	If your motivation is not strong enough,
385000	390000	the interviewer or the person reviewing your document will be able to tell.
390000	396000	In this case, you may be less competitive than other candidates.
396000	399000	So you have to ask yourself why you want to apply for a Ph.D.
399000	401000	Why do you want to study for a master's degree? Why do you want to study for a Ph.D.?
401000	403000	Why do you want to study abroad?
403000	404000	These are all important.
404000	406000	Otherwise, you can stay in Taiwan.
406000	410000	In the field of engineering, you can do very well in Taiwan.
410000	412000	In Taiwan, the Peninsula Institute is very famous.
412000	414000	You can finish a master's degree or Ph.D.
414000	416000	Then you can go to the Peninsula Institute.
416000	417000	You can make a lot of money.
417000	419000	So why do you want to study abroad?
419000	423000	After studying abroad, what are the requirements?
423000	425000	These are the things you have to do.
425000	428000	So at this stage, if you haven't prepared anything,
428000	434000	the time you need the most is to do some research.
434000	436000	Which school should I study?
436000	437000	Which university should I study?
437000	440000	Do I have the opportunity to apply for a Ph.D.?
440000	442000	These are the things we can discuss later.
444000	447000	I applied for a Ph.D. in Germany.
447000	449000	I only applied for a Ph.D.
449000	454000	But in principle, it can be applied to most European and EU countries.
454000	457000	In the traditional European system,
457000	459000	it's a bit like looking for a job.
459000	462000	Our Chinese is called teacher-student system.
462000	466000	If you see a professor who has a Ph.D. position,
466000	468000	you can write a letter to tell him,
468000	470000	I saw you applied for a Ph.D. position.
470000	472000	What's my background?
472000	474000	I'm interested in this topic.
474000	477000	He may ask you to add your resume, motivation, etc.
477000	479000	If he thinks it's OK, he'll say,
479000	481000	OK, let's have an interview.
481000	484000	After the conversation, he might say,
484000	486000	OK, I think you're good. I want to hire you.
486000	488000	Tell me when you're coming.
488000	489000	That's it.
489000	491000	You and the boss are set.
491000	493000	Another one is the structured Ph.D. program.
493000	494000	You may be familiar with it.
494000	497000	It's adapted from English-speaking countries,
497000	500000	such as the US, the UK, Australia, or even Taiwan.
500000	502000	It's a Ph.D. program.
502000	507000	You have to apply to a certain department or Ph.D. program.
507000	509000	It usually has a lot of requirements.
509000	511000	Because it's a program,
511000	514000	it may require you to do lab rotation during your Ph.D.
514000	516000	You have to take classes, etc.
516000	519000	You have to meet certain requirements to be able to defend yourself.
519000	521000	But for a teacher-student system,
521000	524000	you have to go into the lab to do research.
524000	527000	It doesn't require you to take classes, etc.
527000	529000	to graduate.
529000	531000	This is the biggest difference
531000	533000	between a teacher-student system
533000	536000	and a structured program.
536000	539000	Most structured programs,
539000	541000	I'll talk about it later,
541000	543000	besides universities and so-called research institutes,
543000	546000	when it provides a structured program,
546000	548000	it's not unlimited.
548000	549000	Unlike in Taiwan,
549000	552000	when you graduate, you have to wait for your teacher's approval.
552000	554000	It's the same for a teacher-student system.
554000	556000	But in general,
556000	558000	for a structured program,
558000	560000	it usually gives you a 2-3 year contract,
560000	562000	up to 1 year.
562000	564000	So for most structured programs,
564000	568000	the average Ph.D. year is around 4 years.
572000	575000	So how do I start looking for my Ph.D. position?
575000	577000	I didn't put a website here.
577000	579000	You can just type in the title,
579000	581000	like Nature Career, Uroxas,
581000	583000	or just type in your Ph.D.
583000	585000	It's just a website.
585000	587000	Then you can search for your Ph.D. position.
587000	590000	There are a few filter conditions.
590000	592000	It depends on how you want to filter.
592000	594000	Some of these are from the EU.
594000	596000	You might want to go to Germany,
596000	598000	or the UK, etc.
598000	600000	You can filter by yourself.
600000	602000	Nature Career,
602000	604000	in terms of reading a Ph.D. in the EU,
604000	606000	they see it as a job.
606000	608000	So from Nature Career,
608000	610000	you can also see a lot of
610000	612000	European Ph.D. positions.
612000	614000	Uroxas,
614000	616000	is from the EU.
616000	618000	It has a special
618000	620000	fellowship.
620000	622000	I'll talk about it later.
622000	624000	And then there are
624000	626000	some other platforms,
626000	628000	like Ph.D. Scholarly B.
628000	630000	Of course,
630000	632000	if you know
632000	634000	which universities you want to go to,
634000	636000	you can go to
636000	638000	one of the universities
638000	640000	and find a teacher.
640000	642000	If you're interested,
642000	644000	you can write a letter
644000	646000	asking if you're interested
646000	648000	in your research,
648000	650000	and if you want to
650000	652000	get a Ph.D.
652000	654000	It'll tell you
654000	656000	if you're in the right position.
656000	658000	Or if you want to
658000	660000	apply for a program
660000	662000	in my lab,
662000	664000	it'll tell you if you're
664000	666000	in the right network.
666000	668000	Social media,
668000	670000	like Facebook,
670000	672000	Instagram,
672000	674000	Twitter,
674000	676000	a lot of professors
676000	678000	have their own Twitter
678000	680000	or lab Twitter.
680000	682000	If you have a Ph.D.
682000	684000	or post-doc position,
684000	686000	you can post
686000	688000	from there.
688000	690000	I prefer
690000	692000	more and more people
692000	694000	are using LinkedIn.
694000	696000	It's a network opportunity.
696000	698000	If you have a professor
698000	700000	and he posts his position,
700000	702000	you can set a job alert.
702000	704000	You can set a keyword
704000	706000	like Ph.D. Student,
706000	708000	Ph.D. Scholar,
708000	710000	or Ph.D. Researcher.
710000	712000	Your country can be
712000	714000	Europe or Germany.
714000	716000	It'll tell you
716000	718000	which Ph.D. positions
718000	720000	you can apply for.
722000	724000	Let's talk about
724000	726000	what's special
726000	728000	about studying Ph.D.
728000	730000	in Europe.
730000	732000	We usually
732000	734000	focus on
734000	736000	universities.
736000	738000	But in Europe,
738000	740000	universities are more
740000	742000	about teaching.
742000	744000	But in Europe,
744000	746000	there are a lot of
746000	748000	institutes.
748000	750000	A lot of
750000	752000	big international companies
752000	754000	also have Ph.D. positions.
754000	756000	I mentioned
756000	758000	some special
758000	760000	fellowships in EU.
760000	762000	We'll talk about it later.
762000	764000	I can't talk about
764000	766000	all the institutes
766000	768000	in EU.
768000	770000	I'll talk about
770000	772000	the four most famous
772000	774000	institutes in Germany.
774000	776000	There are also
776000	778000	research opportunities
778000	780000	in some institutes.
780000	782000	I'll talk about
782000	784000	Max Planck,
784000	786000	Helmholtz,
786000	788000	Fraunhofer,
788000	790000	and Leibniz.
790000	792000	Different colors
792000	794000	represent different
794000	796000	societies or associations.
796000	798000	There are so many
798000	800000	research opportunities
800000	802000	in Germany.
802000	804000	I'll talk about
804000	806000	Max Planck,

2372000	2374000	if you can see

2376000	2378000	I posted about

2384000	2386000	The latest

2452000	2454000	lab environment.
2454000	2456000	So,
2456000	2458000	I'll start
2458000	2460000	by introducing myself.
2460000	2462000	I'll start with my background
2462000	2464000	so that you can understand
2464000	2466000	what kind of
2466000	2468000	perspective I have
2468000	2470000	when it comes to
2470000	2472000	European Economics.
2472000	2474000	I'll talk about
2474000	2476000	my preparation
2476000	2478000	for European Economics.
2478000	2480000	Then,
2480000	2482000	I'll talk about
2482000	2484000	how to choose a school
2484000	2486000	and my research topic.
2486000	2488000	I'll also talk about
2488000	2490000	my budget
2490000	2492000	and my salary
2492000	2494000	in Europe.
2494000	2496000	Finally,
2496000	2498000	I'll talk about
2498000	2500000	my academic background.
2500000	2502000	I studied in Taiwan
2502000	2504000	from 2014 to 2018,
2504000	2506000	but my master's degree
2506000	2508000	was in Europe.
2508000	2510000	From 2018 to 2019,
2510000	2512000	I studied for one year,
2512000	2514000	and from 2019 to 2020,
2514000	2516000	I studied for two years.
2516000	2518000	From 2021,
2518000	2520000	I went to my doctorate
2520000	2522000	and started writing my thesis.
2522000	2524000	My research topic
2524000	2526000	is economic development
2526000	2528000	and armed conflicts
2528000	2530000	in the United Nations.
2530000	2532000	I'll talk about my preparation
2532000	2534000	for my doctorate.
2534000	2536000	You may be curious
2536000	2538000	about how much you need
2538000	2540000	to study to get
2540000	2542000	a doctorate
2542000	2544000	in the field of
2544000	2546000	social science.
2546000	2548000	I used to ask
2548000	2550000	some teachers
2550000	2552000	in Taiwan University
2552000	2554000	if I didn't get
2554000	2556000	a doctorate
2556000	2558000	in high-level economics
2558000	2560000	or high-level statistics.
2560000	2562000	In fact,
2562000	2564000	it's not so certain.
2564000	2566000	It depends on your goal.
2566000	2568000	If you want to
2568000	2570000	study pure theoretical
2570000	2572000	economic theory,
2572000	2574000	high-level economics
2574000	2576000	or high-level statistics
2576000	2578000	are really necessary.
2578000	2580000	However,
2580000	2582000	as long as you can
2582000	2584000	get a doctorate,
2584000	2586000	you won't have
2586000	2588000	too many problems.
2588000	2590000	If you want to
2590000	2592000	study economics,
2592000	2594000	you need to know
2594000	2596000	whether you like
2596000	2598000	individual,
2598000	2600000	general,
2600000	2602000	or economic economics.
2602000	2604000	You also need to know
2604000	2606000	whether you need
2606000	2608000	a master's degree
2608000	2610000	in Taiwan,
2610000	2612000	because
2612000	2614000	in the U.S.,
2614000	2616000	there are not so many choices
2616000	2618000	for a master's degree.
2618000	2620000	In the U.S.,
2620000	2622000	a lot of master's degrees
2622000	2624000	are held
2624000	2626000	not for
2626000	2628000	a master's degree,
2628000	2630000	but for
2630000	2632000	a master's degree.
2632000	2634000	In the U.S.,
2634000	2636000	a master's degree
2636000	2638000	is given to you
2638000	2640000	as a scholarship.
2640000	2642000	In Chicago,
2642000	2644000	there are some good
2644000	2646000	scholarships,
2646000	2648000	but the tuition
2648000	2650000	is very expensive.
2650000	2652000	In contrast,
2652000	2654000	I chose to study
2654000	2656000	a master's degree in Europe
2656000	2658000	because the tuition
2658000	2660000	is relatively cheap.
2660000	2662000	When I studied
2662000	2664000	a master's degree in the Netherlands,
2664000	2666000	the tuition was 2000 euros per year.
2666000	2668000	In the U.S.,
2668000	2670000	a master's degree
2670000	2672000	can expand
2672000	2674000	your academic network
2674000	2676000	and allow you
2676000	2678000	to adapt to
2678000	2680000	the environment
2680000	2682000	of studying abroad.
2682000	2684000	After two years,
2684000	2686000	you can decide
2686000	2688000	whether you want
2688000	2690000	to apply for a doctor's degree
2690000	2692000	in Europe or
2692000	2694000	in the U.S.
2694000	2696000	In my opinion,
2696000	2698000	even if you decide
2698000	2700000	to apply for a doctor's degree
2700000	2702000	in Taiwan,
2702000	2704000	a lot of people
2704000	2706000	apply for a doctor's degree
2706000	2708000	in Taiwan
2708000	2710000	after two years
2710000	2712000	of studying
2712000	2714000	a master's degree.
2714000	2716000	Some people
2716000	2718000	apply for a doctor's degree
2718000	2720000	after two years
2720000	2722000	of studying
2722000	2724000	a doctor's degree
2724000	2726000	after two years
2726000	2728000	of studying
2728000	2730000	a doctor's degree
2730000	2732000	in Taiwan.
2732000	2734000	Some countries
2734000	2736000	allow you
2736000	2738000	to start writing
2738000	2740000	your thesis
2740000	2742000	after two years
2742000	2744000	of studying
2744000	2746000	a doctor's degree
2746000	2748000	in Taiwan.
2748000	2750000	In my opinion,
2750000	2752000	you can start
2752000	2754000	writing your thesis
2754000	2756000	after two years
2756000	2758000	of studying
2758000	2760000	a doctor's degree
2760000	2762000	in Taiwan
2762000	2764000	after two years
2764000	2766000	of studying
2766000	2768000	a doctor's degree
2768000	2770000	in Taiwan
2770000	2772000	after two years
2772000	2774000	of studying
2774000	2776000	a doctor's degree
2776000	2778000	in Europe.
2778000	2780000	In the past
2780000	2782000	three or four years,
2782000	2784000	many people
2784000	2786000	apply for a doctor's degree
2786000	2788000	after two years
2788000	2790000	of studying
2790000	2792000	a doctor's degree
2792000	2794000	in Europe
2794000	2796000	after two years
2796000	2798000	of studying

3024000	3044000	So if you want to apply for a top-30 school in the U.S., there are many schools in Europe that can be compared.
3044000	3056000	I think the topic is very different from science and engineering, because we usually write a paper with only one person's name,
3056000	3062000	instead of having a lot of co-authors or a whole lab to complete a project.
3062000	3074000	I think the topic is very important for social science students, because sometimes you have to write a research plan yourself,
3074000	3082000	and you have to go all the way from the literature review to the research method, and even if you want to do practical evidence, you have to have information, or you have to do interviews, and so on.
3082000	3092000	All of these have to be written in great detail, but before you apply for a doctoral program, do you have such a detailed research plan?
3092000	3098000	In fact, it has a lot to do with the type of doctoral program you choose.
3098000	3110000	As I mentioned before, American doctoral programs usually start with a training course, and they say that if you have passed the training course in the first two years, you will start writing your own thesis in the third year.
3110000	3118000	If you want to apply for a U.S. doctoral program, they basically do not require a research plan during the application process.
3118000	3124000	In Europe, it is divided into a similar model in the United States, or you can start writing your thesis directly.
3124000	3134000	In Europe, the deadline for writing a thesis is usually three to four years, unlike the United States, where you can write it for four or five years.
3134000	3154000	So, I think this is quite important. If you come to Europe today and decide to start studying for a doctoral program, I think you should be very clear about your research topic, what kind of topic you have, and whether you can complete this doctoral thesis in the next three to four years.
3154000	3166000	So, if you start writing your thesis directly when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program, you usually have to go through the research plan when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program.
3166000	3182000	As I mentioned earlier, in Germany and the Netherlands, you are a school employee, and your job title is a PhD researcher.
3182000	3200000	In Belgium, most of my salary is in contact with HR, but I am not a full-time school employee. What I get is not a job contract, but a scholarship letter.
3200000	3220000	So, some benefits are not the same. For example, I don't have a pension, but if you are in the Netherlands, the school will give you a pension, which is like a pension. It should be considered a pension, but I only have social security insurance.
3220000	3237000	So, the benefits are not the same, but my benefit is that I don't get paid for my work, so I don't have to be taxed for my salary. But in the Netherlands, your salary will be deducted first.
3237000	3262000	In terms of economics, the monthly income is about 1,700 to 2,000 euros. If you start writing your thesis first, you will get a scholarship letter, which is about 500 euros per month, and some people get 1,200 euros.
3262000	3269000	In other words, even if you are in the master's program, as long as you save enough money, you don't have to spend too much money on your master's program.
3269000	3283000	In the Netherlands and Germany, there are more of these methods. In the first two years of your master's program, you have a chance to get a scholarship.
3284000	3298000	I think it's important to figure out your source of income, because if you study abroad and spend your youth, you may be 30 years old after studying for 34 years. You don't want to be in debt after studying.
3299000	3319000	So if you find that your source of income is a master's program, which is more like a master's program, and every August you have to ask the professor and the HR of the school to confirm that the student's budget can be extended for another year.
3320000	3333000	So my scholarship letter is not given once every four years, but it is renewed every year. At first, I was afraid that the teacher would be displeased with me, or I would be lazy, so I decided not to renew it.
3334000	3350000	I think this is a tricky point for a master's program. You really have to make sure that the teacher's personality is normal and he is a good person. Otherwise, I have heard that the teacher is unhappy and the master's program can only be terminated for half a year.
3350000	3365000	My personal experience is that I used to study in the Netherlands and Belgium, and my boyfriend is now studying economics in Germany, and I also applied to a German school.
3365000	3372000	I have been talking about Europe and other countries, and now I want to talk about these three countries more clearly.
3372000	3385000	In the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a one-year or two-year master's program. In Spain, I studied for one year, but why did I study for another two years in the Netherlands?
3385000	3407000	Usually, a one-year master's program is not considered to be a program that allows you to write a thesis. It stipulates that you need to have 120 ECTS. You don't have to worry about the points. If you study for two years in Taiwan, you will definitely be able to write a thesis in Europe.
3407000	3429000	However, if you study for one year in Europe, most students will want to study for another two years. In the Netherlands, the two-year master's program is generally referred to as a research master's program.
3429000	3454000	In fact, it is a bit like the UK, where there is a difference between MSc and MPhil. In Germany, the two-year master's program is basically two years. So whether you are studying for MSc or MSc, it is still a two-year course. The first year is a basic course, and the second year you start writing a thesis.
3454000	3472000	In terms of language, many people will think that I am studying in Europe today. Usually, I am not sure what the literature field is, but at least in economics, all programs and school requirements are based on English.
3472000	3493000	If you are in the Netherlands, you don't have to worry too much about whether you want to learn Dutch. If you live in the French-speaking area of ​​Belgium or in Germany, I think learning a little language is a good thing, and it is also a leisure other than studying for a master's program. Otherwise, English is basically enough.
3494000	3513000	Usually, the language requirements related to social science are relatively high, such as TOEFL and IELTS. However, TOEFL requires at least 100 points, and IELTS requires at least 7 points or more.
3513000	3529000	In terms of immigration, I think the reason why you want to go to a certain country to study is not only because of the school, but also because you want to plan your entire career. If I graduate, can I stay here to work or even apply for permanent residence?
3529000	3549000	I think there is a big point to consider, and that is whether you can get a work contract. I have been in Europe since 2018, but my years are in different countries, so I can't transfer to permanent residence.
3549000	3567000	For example, I have been studying in Belgium for 4 years, and I have been in Europe for 7 years, so I can't apply for permanent residence, because I am taking a student's scholarship, not a job. However, in the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.
3567000	3585000	In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved. In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.
3585000	3612000	In terms of employment opportunities, I think there are more job opportunities in Europe than in Taiwan, because in economics, in the EU, you can often find companies like competition economics or competition consulting, but there are fewer such industries in Taiwan, and most people are still in the financial industry.
3612000	3631000	For example, some people like social impact, or some areas that are considered not profitable in Taiwan, but I think there are many opportunities in Europe, and this is why I want to come to Europe to study, and even stay here to work in the future.
3631000	3645000	My application experience goes back to the basics, which is how to apply for a doctorate. The offer I got at that time was one in Germany, one in Belgium, and one in the Netherlands.
3645000	3664000	In Germany, it is a 5-year doctorate class, which is a 2-year class plus a 3-year thesis. In the Netherlands, it is also 2 years plus 4 years or 2 years plus 3 years.
3664000	3692000	So, if you want to write a letter to the professor, in fact, like in Germany, there was no need to write a letter to the professor in the second half of the Netherlands and the second half of the Netherlands, but in Luwen, where I am now, because it is a master-apprentice relationship, the teacher opened a circle on his website or the school's website and said that I now have a research plan, and I can hire a doctorate student for this plan.
3692000	3710000	If you are interested in this position, you can write a letter to me with your CV and motivation, and then the teacher will look at the information you sent him and see if he is interested in you.
3710000	3722000	So, like this, if you see a job position, you usually start writing your thesis directly. This is the case in both Belgium and Germany, and it is relatively rare in the Netherlands, but it is also the case.
3722000	3743000	So, in fact, it's back to Europe, because in the beginning of Europe, they are all master-apprentices, but it's just because economics is more similar to the US training method. It allows you to take two more years of classes before you write your thesis to ensure that the training you receive is of a certain level.
3744000	3767000	As I said earlier, the entrance requirements of the doctoral class are to find a way to do your own related courses in college, and then if you write your thesis in Taiwan and teach in Taiwan, then basically your own thesis should be able to be presented in English to your future doctoral class.
3767000	3790000	The motivation and research plan really depend on what field you want to study. For example, I said at the beginning that I wanted to study economic development because I was also doing economic development in the past, and I was also very interested in this part.
3791000	3804000	In terms of recommendations, I think it is a very important reason for deciding whether you will go to a certain school, at least in economics.
3804000	3822000	Because when I was in Manhattan, my recommendation was a professor when I was studying in Barcelona, and it just so happens that the professor of the Manhattan Graduate Committee was staying in Barcelona before, so he knew those two professors.
3822000	3839000	I think that in the academic world, your skill sets are usually so-called soft skills, which means that you may be very good at writing, you may have a lot of ideas, or you may have a lot of research ideas, but these things are not so easy to quantify.
3839000	3856000	Because we usually publish a lot of papers when we are not in the undergraduate master's program. These hard-to-quantify skills are actually based on your recommendation and your recommender to help you present.
3856000	3871000	So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.
3871000	3900000	So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.
3902000	3916000	This is because I just wanted to add that, in fact, what is the standard of living in Europe with 1200 euros of master's scholarships or 2000 euros of doctoral scholarships? I think it is absolutely enough.
3916000	3929000	The advantage of living in Europe is that I don't know how to drive, but I think a lot of students who study in the U.S. will not be able to go anywhere if they don't know how to drive.
3929000	3941000	But I didn't have time to learn how to drive when I was in Taiwan, so I had to come out and study. But I think in Europe, you don't have to be afraid of driving.
3942000	3957000	The advantage of living in Europe is that you can buy cheap tickets for Christmas and summer vacation and travel around. So, you don't necessarily have to go to the U.S. to come to Europe. You will also have a good life and a happy doctoral program.
3958000	3966000	When studying for a doctoral program, I think it is much more important to find a good teacher and the right topic than the school rankings in Europe.
3967000	3978000	Because every school in Europe has its own specialties, if you only look at the rankings, you may miss out on the fact that there is a teacher here who has published a lot of good papers, and it happens to be your field.
3979000	3988000	Then, you need to develop your daily routine and habits. For example, my contract is that I don't even need to teach any books. I don't need to be a TA.
3989000	3999000	Sometimes I feel like I'm so free today, and I don't know what to do. But in fact, this flexibility is a good thing, but sometimes it makes you too lazy.
4000000	4005000	In Europe, in addition to reading books, learning languages ​​is also a good hobby.
4006000	4011000	I'm done talking. I think it's about time. Thank you.
4012000	4022000	Thank you for sharing. We expect to open Q&A until about 10.50, and then we will start issuing digital participation certificates.
4022000	4032000	Because there are quite a few people today, so if you want to directly open the microphone to ask questions, please raise your hand first.
4033000	4038000	Or you can also type the question in the chat and I will pay attention to it.
4052000	4062000	If you are still thinking about what questions to ask, when you are preparing for that question, I think you can ask Zhao Yuan to share again.
4063000	4071000	What is the difference between the United States and Europe when it comes to the field of science and technology?
4072000	4076000	Let me share my screen again.
4077000	4085000	I forgot to mention that if I talked too fast or if you have any personal questions that are not convenient to ask, you can contact me.
4086000	4093000	My email is haiyongjiancornell. You can also scan the QR code and you can link with me.
4094000	4106000	Because the last speaker talked a little bit about stipends and contracts, I will talk about Germany first and then enter the United States.
4107000	4111000	For example, because the speaker has already talked about it, I will talk faster.
4111000	4117000	It really depends on the boss. I think if you can get a contract, please get a contract.
4118000	4121000	You will get a visa, a work visa, not a student visa.
4122000	4124000	The work visa means that you are the same as most employees.
4125000	4128000	In principle, in Germany, it is a 20-30-day vacation.
4129000	4131000	For our medical school, it is a 30-day vacation.
4132000	4136000	Your salary includes tax, pension and medical insurance.
4137000	4139000	Please remember that German medical insurance is very expensive.
4139000	4146000	So if you want to pay for it yourself, you will have to pay a lot of money from your own pocket.
4147000	4152000	And if you are already paying taxes, you have been paying for four years and you have just graduated.
4153000	4159000	Then I found out that you are looking for a job, whether it is a postdoc or a medical job, and then the school is over.
4160000	4163000	Because you have paid taxes before, and then there is a bit of unemployment in the middle.
4164000	4167000	In fact, you will be paid a unemployment pension because you have no money.
4168000	4170000	And a lot of social benefits.
4171000	4177000	In Germany, we are not the so-called tuition fee, we are usually the semester fee.
4178000	4182000	Then each class will have different rules, and then for our school, it is 290 euros.
4183000	4190000	So if you don't have an economic assessment, I think Germany is a good choice.
4191000	4194000	Then we come to the difference between the United States and Germany.
4194000	4199000	In the United States, it is a program system for each school program.
4200000	4202000	It has a fixed application deadline every year.
4203000	4210000	Suddenly it's winter, and then fall next year.
4211000	4214000	Then, in Germany, I just said that there are two systems.
4215000	4216000	There is no certain teacher-student system.
4217000	4220000	Then, if the program system, of course, there is an application deadline.
4220000	4223000	However, each program has a different deadline.
4224000	4228000	For example, Envelope and MPI know that they try not to squeeze together.
4229000	4230000	So they will miss each other.
4231000	4235000	Then in every institute of MPI, their Ph.D. program will not be unified.
4236000	4238000	You just saw that every institute is listed in various cities.
4239000	4241000	So this is what you have to check on the Internet.
4242000	4245000	And the application requirement is that you may need something.
4245000	4251000	As I mentioned earlier, in the United States, you don't have to have a master's degree.
4252000	4256000	But in Europe, most of them need a master's degree.
4257000	4262000	In English exam, there is no so-called GRE in Germany.
4263000	4264000	It is mainly TOEFL and EAS.
4265000	4269000	Even if the time is more than two years, most of them can be accepted.
4270000	4271000	In the United States, there is one more GRE.
4271000	4278000	Of course, I know that in recent years, many schools, and the better schools, have actually removed the GRE.
4279000	4285000	Because they think, or GMAT, if the social science is GMAT, they will think that this is not necessarily related to research.
4286000	4287000	The resume is a must.
4288000	4289000	Here, CV is not a resume.
4290000	4292000	The meaning of CV is that the academic resume is all of it.
4293000	4294000	Most of it has no page speed limit.
4295000	4298000	You can write it on anything related to academics.
4298000	4301000	In the application document, this will be a little different.
4302000	4305000	Because the United States is still used to SOP, Statement of Purpose.
4306000	4313000	It is more important to see how your past experience will affect your next PhD, next career, next step.
4314000	4318000	However, if it is in Germany, it is more like so-called lateral motivation.
4319000	4321000	Because you have to think about one thing.
4322000	4324000	Because the PhD in Germany is relatively short.
4325000	4326000	It is three to four years.
4326000	4328000	In addition, you already have a master's degree.
4329000	4330000	So you are very clear.
4331000	4336000	Including just now, it should be considered that you already know what your research direction goal is.
4337000	4341000	So you should talk about your past academic and where your goal is.
4342000	4345000	Because I had a background in the past, so I had to find this lab to do this kind of research.
4346000	4350000	But in the United States, you still have the so-called first-year course and lab rotation.
4351000	4353000	So it cares more about your potential.
4353000	4355000	What did you experience in the past?
4356000	4358000	What will your future development be?
4359000	4361000	But you don't have to think too much now.
4362000	4364000	Because in principle, when you are applying for a document, a certain program will tell you.
4365000	4367000	He hopes that this document will contain something.
4368000	4374000	Recommendation letter, then the United States must be three points can not run away.
4375000	4377000	In Germany, it is two to three points, not necessarily.
4378000	4380000	Then there must be a score sheet.
4381000	4383000	It's just that when you apply, you have to submit it or be accepted.
4384000	4386000	Then there is a very interesting one in Germany.
4387000	4392000	Because of the education system itself, they also want to provide a high school score sheet.
4393000	4394000	So it's a bit of a hassle.
4395000	4398000	But in order to submit a high school score sheet in English, it took me a little time.
4399000	4402000	Then the United States has almost no paper test.
4402000	4404000	Then in Germany, there are several.
4405000	4407000	For example, Heidelberg needs to be interviewed.
4408000	4414000	Then the Ph.D. system, as I just mentioned, has the so-called teacher-student structure system.
4415000	4417000	I just talked about the cost.
4418000	4420000	The cost is really a lot worse.
4421000	4423000	Because in the United States, there are some more conservative schools that may be free.
4424000	4426000	For example, the German system is mostly free.
4427000	4429000	Up to $100.
4429000	4431000	But in principle, all the application fees here in Germany are free.
4432000	4434000	And you don't have to send your results from ETS.
4435000	4437000	This money may be several years ago.
4438000	4440000	It may be higher now, I don't know.
4441000	4443000	But you don't have to send this ETS score sheet in addition.
4444000	4446000	But it's possible that he'll do it for you.
4447000	4449000	He cares a lot about whether your transcript has been recognized.
4450000	4452000	He usually tells you that there will be a uni-assistant in Germany.
4453000	4455000	And then he will ask you to sign up.
4455000	4457000	It seems that there are some schools in the United States.
4458000	4460000	But I didn't meet at all when I applied.
4461000	4463000	And then, do you need to submit a paper document?
4464000	4466000	I think it depends on the program.
4467000	4469000	And then I mentioned the stipend and salary part.
4470000	4472000	Germany has stipend and contract.
4473000	4475000	In the United States, we actually quite agree.
4476000	4478000	Because you have to pay your own taxes later.
4479000	4481000	Like we're in the US right now.
4481000	4483000	In the United States, you get that money.
4484000	4486000	You have to pay your own taxes every year.
4487000	4489000	But usually the school will give you your tuition.
4490000	4492000	And then you have to pay your own taxes.
4493000	4495000	And then it's actually called health insurance.
4496000	4498000	Health insurance has to pay for itself.
4499000	4501000	I think another great place is Europe.
4502000	4504000	After you were invited, all your expenses.
4505000	4507000	I think it's a good thing.
4507000	4509000	After you were invited, all your expenses.
4510000	4512000	It turns out that my program was one week.
4513000	4515000	And then I was still studying in the United States.
4516000	4518000	When I flew from New York to here, all my expenses.
4519000	4521000	Tickets and so on were covered.
4522000	4524000	I know that this is getting less and less in the United States.
4525000	4527000	Because they want to save a little more money.
4528000	4530000	And now Skype interview is very convenient.
4531000	4533000	But the European system is still quite a lot.
4534000	4536000	The program will still retain this.
4537000	4539000	I think this is quite important.
4540000	4542000	And then during your Ph.D.
4543000	4545000	What will happen to you?
4546000	4548000	In Germany, if you are a 15-year-old, you don't have to go to class at all.
4549000	4551000	The program may be required to take a little class.
4552000	4554000	That kind of class is not the so-called combined course.
4555000	4557000	It may be some scientific practice or something like that.
4558000	4560000	There are some theoretical courses or something like that.
4561000	4563000	But in the United States, it's his first year, second year.
4564000	4566000	It's like your master, you still have to repair how many credits.
4567000	4569000	In the United States, a lot of times you still have to do lab rotation.
4570000	4572000	So you may be in the second year before you decide your lab.
4573000	4575000	But in Germany, in principle,
4576000	4578000	You have to decide your boss when you interview.
4579000	4581000	And then are you qualified to take the exam?
4582000	4584000	A lot of people in the United States are still qualified to take the exam.
4585000	4587000	But in Germany, you don't.
4588000	4590000	You are the professor who has been with people for three or four years.
4591000	4593000	And then a lot of programs in the United States require you to be a TA.
4594000	4596000	If you don't want to be a TA,
4597000	4599000	If you don't want to be a TA or just want to focus on research,
4600000	4602000	Germany will be more suitable for this.
4603000	4605000	The term of leave is quite different.
4606000	4608000	Because like I said, you need a master's degree to apply for a PhD in Germany.
4609000	4611000	In general, his term of leave is relatively short.
4612000	4614000	And if you miss the lab rotation, course, etc.
4615000	4617000	Of course, you can focus on research and graduate earlier.
4618000	4620000	But in the United States, it will be a little longer.
4621000	4623000	Flexibility of the project
4624000	4626000	Because I know a lot of American words, he's actually the boss.
4627000	4629000	I may not be discussing with him.
4630000	4632000	But if you think about it, the so-called master's degree in Germany means
4633000	4635000	Or it's like a job.
4636000	4638000	It's because of the grant project.
4639000	4641000	He may want you to do that thing.
4642000	4644000	So your flexibility may be limited.
4645000	4647000	Work-life balance, Europe must be the best.
4648000	4650000	It's just that you have so many annual leave.
4651000	4653000	In the United States, there may not be.
4654000	4656000	And because the United States is longer.
4657000	4659000	And then Germany is relatively short.
4660000	4662000	So there's a higher chance that you may not have one when you graduate.
4663000	4665000	This may also be something you have to think about.
4666000	4668000	The main comparison is probably here.
4669000	4671000	And then maybe you can stop here.
4672000	4674000	And then if you have any questions, you can ask the two of us.
