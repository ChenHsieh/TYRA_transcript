29000	42000	Today's speaker is Lian Chuan-Ping, and his topic is the relationship between high-level atmospheric wind turbines and their relationship with space weather.
42000	50000	Lian Chuan-Ping is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aerospace and Space Sciences at Colorado University.
50000	56000	His field of research is data synchronization, electromagnetic transfer, and solar eclipses.
56000	64000	In addition to his research, he also enjoys hiking, jogging, and watching movies at home.
64000	69000	I'll hand over to Chuan-Ping.
70000	73000	Hello everyone, I'm Lian Chuan-Ping.
73000	83000	Today's speaker's topic is the relationship between high-level atmospheric wind turbines and their relationship with space weather.
83000	96000	Today, I will focus on the reason why we want to conduct high-level atmospheric wind turbines.
97000	101000	First of all, this is my background.
101000	107000	My major focus is on space weather forecast.
107000	112000	The method I use is data synchronization.
112000	120000	The solar weather we are targeting is the daily change of the electromagnetic force of the Earth's magnetic field.
120000	124000	We can understand it as a type of space weather.
124000	129000	Later, I will introduce in detail what type of space weather it is.
129000	131000	This is our main topic for today.
131000	135000	First, we will introduce what space weather is and its definition.
135000	139000	Then, we will talk about what type of space weather we want to forecast,
139000	143000	why we want to forecast this system, and how to forecast it.
143000	150000	Finally, we will talk about the difficulties and challenges we encounter.
150000	161000	These are the reasons why we conduct high-level atmospheric wind turbines.
161000	166000	First, what is space weather?
166000	178000	Space weather refers to the daily change of the interaction between the matter in space and the atmosphere on Earth.
178000	182000	Basically, we can understand it as the so-called weather.
182000	193000	In this study, we focus on the low-middle latitude electromagnetic layer of the Earth.
193000	201000	Its height is approximately at the boundary of the Earth's high-level atmosphere and space.
201000	211000	In order to forecast this system, we must first understand the composition of the high-level atmosphere.
211000	217000	This graph shows the height of the Earth's surface.
217000	223000	The middle axis is the height, and the horizontal axis is the density of gas particles.
223000	234000	The blue and black lines indicate the change of electromagnetic particles in height.
234000	238000	The orange line is the so-called middle atmosphere.
238000	246000	For example, it may be the part of oxygen molecules, nitrogen molecules, or oxygen atoms.
246000	255000	We can clearly see in this graph that the density of the middle atmosphere is much higher than the so-called electromagnetic density.
255000	266000	And the higher the number is, we can see that the horizontal axis is a difference of tens of times or more than tens of times or more than tens of times.
267000	278000	In such a high-level atmosphere, the electromagnetic layer is not very uniform.
278000	291000	We can observe the so-called electromagnetic irregularity, or the phenomenon of an equatorial plasma bubble.
291000	296000	This is one of the types of space weather we want to forecast.
296000	302000	The graph on the left is a wet map, and the red part represents the more electromagnetic density.
302000	308000	The blue part represents an area with relatively less electromagnetic density.
308000	324000	The graph on the right is a high-level area of about 200 to 400 kilometers.
324000	328000	This is a high-level area.
328000	336000	As for its three-dimensional structure, we can see that the graph on the left is a simulation of an electromagnetic bubble.
336000	342000	The three axes on the left are the height, the diameter, and the latitude.
342000	350000	The yellow part represents an area with relatively more electromagnetic density.
350000	353000	The blue part represents an area with relatively less electromagnetic density.
353000	361000	The so-called electromagnetic bubble develops along a cone-shaped area.
361000	369000	The cone-shaped area is the magnetic field of the Earth's magnetic field.
370000	384000	If we cut down from the magnetic field of the Earth, we can see that the so-called electromagnetic bubble is a high-level area that looks like a bubble.
384000	398000	If we look down from space, we will find that the area with relatively less electromagnetic density is a cone-shaped area.
398000	405000	This is an actual observation.
405000	410000	The time period is November and December 2019.
410000	419000	The red area represents an area with relatively more electromagnetic density.
419000	426000	The so-called dark area is the area where the electromagnetic bubble occurs.
426000	431000	The interesting thing is that it sometimes occurs and sometimes does not occur.
431000	441000	The video on the right shows the so-called electromagnetic bubble change every day.
441000	444000	We can understand it as the so-called space weather.
444000	451000	We can see that this dark area sometimes does not occur and sometimes does occur.
451000	455000	Why do we want to forecast it?
455000	463000	The main reason is that the U.S. government has proposed a policy related to space weather preparation.
463000	469000	It was released in 2015 and was updated in 2019.
469000	479000	Because of this policy, the U.S. military began to focus on space weather forecasts and space weather-related research.
479000	485000	One of the reasons is that the military relies on the wireless communications system.
485000	493000	When we just mentioned the irregularity of the power line or the electromagnetic bubble, the signal will be reduced or flashed.
493000	500000	This is why we want to carry out space weather forecasts.
501000	515000	In addition to the observations we just mentioned, we can also use the Formosa Satellite-7 satellite that Taiwan and the United States have cooperated with to observe the electromagnetic bubble.
515000	530000	This satellite has several satellites, so it can carry out a relatively wide coverage rate in space to observe the electromagnetic bubble.
530000	537000	Each satellite is equipped with a global navigation satellite system receiver.
538000	551000	This satellite can receive signals from GPS or GNSS global satellite systems.
551000	557000	We all know that when a radio wave or light passes through an interface, it creates a distortion phenomenon.
557000	572000	The so-called radio occupation observation is to use this principle to carry out a high-level observation of the power line to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.
573000	583000	The image on the right shows a relatively high-level global navigation satellite system receiver.
583000	591000	When the radio wave or light passes through an interface, it creates a distortion phenomenon.
591000	597000	We use this distortion phenomenon to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.
598000	609000	The image on the left shows the so-called high-level distortion phenomenon mentioned in this study.
609000	623000	The so-called high-level distortion phenomenon is to use this principle to carry out a high-level observation of the power line to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble.
623000	631000	Usually, we assume that the location of such an interface is on the line of the electric wave and the curve of the ball.
631000	638000	We use this principle to predict the area and location of the electromagnetic bubble or the irregularity of the electromagnetic layer.
638000	654000	Next, we need to think about how to predict the system and the characteristics of the system.
655000	662000	When we predict a system, the most important thing is the so-called error.
662000	668000	We want to use error or probability to express the reliability of our prediction.
668000	672000	But we don't want this error to be too big or too small.
672000	677000	We want this error to be in a more moderate range.
677000	685000	It can change at any time, but we basically don't want it to happen on the right.
685000	688000	One of the phenomena is that you can see the error.
688000	691000	The width represents the error.
691000	696000	We don't want this error to spread more and more to a situation of infinite magnitude.
696000	704000	Or we don't want this error to get closer and closer to a fixed value as time goes by.
705000	707000	This is easy to understand.
707000	709000	For example, the following situation.
709000	716000	If the error is getting smaller and smaller as time goes by, we don't have to predict it.
716000	721000	Because it will become a fixed value.
721000	725000	So we don't have to predict the necessity of such a system.
725000	728000	In short, we want the system we want to predict.
728000	735000	The error will not be too big or too small as time goes by.
736000	741000	Then we think about how to predict.
741000	747000	In our research, the method we use is the so-called data assimilation.
747000	757000	It uses statistics to combine observation and prediction to produce a initial condition.
757000	762000	Then the initial condition is digitally simulated to achieve the purpose of prediction.
762000	769000	Specifically, how do we use statistics to combine observation and prediction?
770000	778000	Specifically, we use Bayes' theorem to update our error.
778000	788000	The figure on the left shows what we will get after updating with Bayes' theorem.
788000	793000	The horizontal axis is the temperature and the vertical axis is the probability density.
793000	815000	We can see that the probability density function we provided at the beginning is relatively accurate after observation update.
815000	821000	In terms of probability, it is a relatively narrow probability distribution.
821000	826000	Through Bayes' theorem, we update such a probability density function.
826000	831000	We can get a more accurate and realistic probability density function.
831000	841000	The result shown is that we will get a relatively high probability density function.
842000	850000	The next thing we want to think about is how to predict.
850000	855000	Since we have updated our probability density function through observation,
855000	865000	How do we get the next time probability density function?
866000	883000	We basically use the probability density function we just got to sample the probability density function.
883000	903000	Then we do several digital simulations to achieve the purpose of prediction.
903000	913000	The most important thing we care about when we do prediction is the error and its average value.
913000	923000	Prediction is a function that calculates error or probability density.
923000	932000	Since this is a static situation, we encounter a lot of challenges.
932000	943000	Today, I will talk about how to connect our scientific problems to initial conditions.
943000	949000	This is what the weather forecast we know is doing.
949000	953000	It is to connect the problem to the initial condition problem.
953000	958000	Now I have two groups of experiments.
958000	961000	One group of experiments is the control group.
961000	964000	The other group of experiments is the contrast group.
964000	970000	I simulated the spring of 2009.
971000	973000	There are a lot of variables.
973000	976000	One of the variables is the initial condition.
976000	982000	This initial condition contains some information about the electric field and neutral atmosphere.
982000	991000	In this model, it will have the so-called low-level and low-level boundary conditions.
991000	993000	The main part is the neutral atmosphere.
994000	1003000	Of course, there is also the source of energy, the input of solar energy and high-density energy.
1003000	1010000	Basically, in these two groups of experiments, the input of energy and the boundary conditions at the bottom are fixed.
1010000	1013000	The only difference is the initial condition.
1013000	1024000	The final result is that we have almost the same electromagnetic density distribution.
1024000	1025000	What does this mean?
1025000	1030000	It means that it implies the following result.
1030000	1035000	At first, there may be a big difference in the initial condition of this system.
1035000	1043000	However, as time goes by, this error will gradually be reduced to a fixed value.
1043000	1048000	In fact, this is not what we want to happen.
1048000	1051000	And this is different from the actual observation.
1051000	1060000	We just showed an image of the daily change of electromagnetic density over time.
1060000	1063000	You can see that it actually changes every day.
1063000	1073000	So, if we express this change in terms of probability, it will not be reduced to a stable state.
1073000	1084000	So, a very interesting phenomenon is that when we forecast electricity prices, we also have to consider the neutral atmosphere.
1085000	1096000	If we go back to the high-density ratio just now, this is actually a very easy-to-understand situation.
1096000	1105000	In fact, the density of the neutral atmosphere is much higher than the so-called electromagnetic density.
1105000	1111000	And this density is several times higher.
1111000	1116000	You can see that the unit below this is 10 to the 5th square, 10 to the 6th square, 10 to the 7th square, 10 to the 8th square.
1116000	1119000	This is several thousand times the difference.
1119000	1129000	So, this result implies that we also need to consider the neutral atmosphere while forecasting electricity prices.
1129000	1135000	This is also one of the reasons why we are working now.
1136000	1142000	At present, we are doing high-density atmospheric wind farm simulation.
1142000	1148000	The so-called high-density atmosphere is actually the boundary condition of the bottom layer of the model we just used.
1148000	1151000	It is about 97 kilometers high.
1151000	1163000	The initial idea of ​​this study is that we do not want the system we want to forecast to be close to a fixed value.
1163000	1171000	We do not want it to be close to the same state as time flows.
1171000	1177000	Because this is not quite in line with the daily changes in the electricity layer we observe.
1178000	1191000	The above is why I am doing my current doctoral research.
1191000	1202000	If you are interested, there are more detailed information on the website.
1202000	1208000	So, if you are interested, you can google this topic.
1208000	1213000	The above is the summary of my speech.
1213000	1221000	Forecasting has many things to be confirmed and completed.
1221000	1231000	I hope that we will be able to provide such a service in the future.
1231000	1241000	Just like our low-layer atmospheric weather forecast system.
1241000	1250000	I think this is a good long-term goal for a doctoral student.
1250000	1257000	The above is my report. Thank you.
1258000	1261000	I am Ming-Hsuan, the host.
1261000	1264000	Our current video is a recording.
