00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
In today's talk, we have Tao Yizhe.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
His topic is Taiwan bilingual policy and education review.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
The speaker is a teacher with physical education, health education, and English teacher certificate.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
He has studied in the US, Europe, the Ministry of Education, and the University of Queensland, Australia.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
His research interests include professional development, education, and sports-related issues.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
His doctoral research topics include language learning, cross-cultural communication,

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
how to find language learning experience,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
long-term bilingual education experience,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
and the participation and observation of Taiwan education and society in recent years.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
It is the first time in the country that a bilingual policy and education review can have a deep understanding of macroeconomic analysis.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
According to our TARA tradition, we will turn on the microphone to welcome the speaker.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Are you ready?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
If you are ready, let's give him a round of applause.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Are these guests in Taiwan or in the US?

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Can I know the background of the audience?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I am in the US.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Dr. Chen Tian-Yuan.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
What about the others?

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Can you turn on the microphone?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
I don't know why you are here.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
But I will start now.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I thought it was yesterday.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
The time you sent me seems to be yesterday.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I didn't schedule anything yesterday.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
So, I may not be here for a long time.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
If I have a chance, I will share it with you.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
I am a teacher in high school.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I am in the second year of Zheng University.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
I am also a professor in the Center for Calculus in Zheng University.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I teach calculus.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
As you can see in my resume,

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
I have worked with a lot of organizations.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Let's get back to my background.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I am a senior student.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I majored in PE.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But I like English.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
I took the English exam in high school.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
When I was in college, I wanted to major in English.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
So, I took the English exam.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't need to take the exam now.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I just need to apply for the exam.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So, I got my license after graduation.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
There are not many PE majors in China.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I also have an English license.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
English helped me a lot.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
So, I may share it later.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
I hope to observe and comment on the state of Chinese in China.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
But I still have some ideas.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
This is related to my learning experience.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
When I was learning English,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
my English teacher had little influence on me.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
We all learn by ourselves.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
The point of self-study is that

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
the Ministry of Education has been talking about the direction of education.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I learn English not for the exam.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
So, I started to apply English in my daily life in middle school.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So, this is how I do it.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
When I went to school,

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I would ask my classmates to try to interact with me in English.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
At that time,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I was 46 years old.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
When I was in my teens,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
it was hard to take the college entrance exam.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It was not easy to take the exam at that time.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
It was too late to prepare for the exam.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
It was hard to speak English,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
listen to English music,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and check the English list.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
However, this kind of learning experience

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
was helpful for the exam.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So, it also influenced

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
my objective view of the current topic,

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
the policy of bilingualism.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Anyway,

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
I got the scholarship from the Ministry of Education.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Then, I chose the Human Movement Studies

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
at the University of Queensland, Australia

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
as my major to study

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
in the Department of Science and Regional Studies.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
At that time,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
my research was focused on...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
As I was studying in the Department of Science and Regional Studies,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I got the scholarship from

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Sports Coaching and Training.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
It was focused on the direction of natural science.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
That was the general trend in Taiwan.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
However, when I went to Australia,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I followed my teachers.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
They went to areas like

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Sports Psychology, Sports Education,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Sports Society,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
and the disciplinary area.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Therefore, my doctoral thesis

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
was focused on direct research.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I studied the topic

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
of a local organization

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
representing the Olympic Games.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
The key word is

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Workplace Learning.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Workplace Learning is an area

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
that I use.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I studied the professional talents

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
in the area

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
and how to develop professionally.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
The Olympic team I chose

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
was actually

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
the Olympic diving team.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
If you go to Australia in 2000,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
you can get a gold medal

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
for diving in a row.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
If you have a certain understanding

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
of sports,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
you know that diving is usually

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
dominated by China.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Why did Australia get a gold medal

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
for diving in a row?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Because they hired

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
foreign coaches.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Especially,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Chinese elite coaches.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Therefore, my research topic

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
was to study how these people

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
learn and develop

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
through cultural exchange.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Of course, the focus

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
was mainly on the coach himself.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
For example, how did he get

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
his professional skills?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Of course, it has to do with his

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
professional experience or

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
where he has taught.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
However, there is an important point

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
about their cross-cultural communication.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
In other words,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
their language,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
because the requirements in Australia

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
are different from Taiwan.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Foreigners go there

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
to learn

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
in their official language.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
For example, in Taiwan,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
if you know,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
like Howard,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
but we still send

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
translators for him.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
This is the difference in nationality.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
However, in Australia,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
no matter where you work,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
even if you are a chef,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
or a professional,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
you have to use

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
their official language to communicate.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Therefore, this is a challenge

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
for foreign coaches,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
especially for non-English-speaking countries.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Therefore, my research topic

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
was to ask them how they learned

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
their language.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
In this process,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I integrated my own

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
master's training,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
personal interest in long-term English,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
and the training

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
in my research.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Therefore,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I have this part

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
of my language policy.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
The most important thing is that

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
in fact, in the country of 2030,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
or the policy of 2030,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
before it started in 2017,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I had been teaching

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
for more than 15 years.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
In 2000,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
when I was working

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
in a school,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
or when I was

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
a teacher,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I was actually

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
trying to teach

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
all-English or

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
sign language sports.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Therefore,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I have 15 years of experience in this area.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Because of this situation,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I have become

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
a problem for many

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
domestic

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
frontline workers,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
teaching staff,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
or those who

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
criticize

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
the policy.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I have no problem with

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
this.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
However,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
in theory,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I may not be able to

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
implement the framework

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
of English.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Therefore,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I have to learn

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
not only from

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
the experience of

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
ethics,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
but also from

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
the experience of

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
science.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Therefore,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
in addition to my

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
major,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I have been

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
teaching

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
for more than

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
15 years.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
This is also

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
a major

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
interest of mine.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
This is also

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
a major

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
interest of mine.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
This is also

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
a major

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
interest of mine.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
In addition to

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
studying in Australia,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I went to

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
the United States.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Before I went to

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
the United States,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
although the English

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I learned in Taiwan

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
was not typical,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I still found

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
some differences.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
For example,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
their everyday English

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
was different from

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
our training.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
This made me

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
think about

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
what I should do

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
to improve my English.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
For example,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
when I traveled to

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Europe,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I went to

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
the International

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Olympic Youth Conference

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
in Greece.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I noticed that

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
the official language

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
was English.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I noticed that

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
the official language

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
was English.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
We're the

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
scholars of Taiwan,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Japan, and Korea.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
We're all based in LGBTQI community.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
But I was the

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
moderator of

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
the Japanese and Korean

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
oral posters yesterday,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
which means I am the host of them.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
But I was the moderator of

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
the Japanese and Korean

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
oral posters yesterday,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
which means I am the host of them.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I have a good feeling about the details

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
of the post.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I have a solution, of course.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
So, today I'm going to

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
talk about a few

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
key issues.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And how far

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
the research has gone.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Let's see if we can interact.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
This chart

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
shows

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
my language learning.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm learning

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
PopFish,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
and I'm using

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
language in my daily life.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm using language in my daily life.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
That's about it.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
That's about it.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That's about it.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
As I mentioned earlier,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
As I mentioned earlier,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
if you're interested,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
if you're interested,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
if you're interested,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
you can google my name.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You'll find

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
many comments

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
and articles.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and articles.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Besides my book,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
I have many other articles.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
If you're interested,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
you'll find

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and articles

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and articles

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Chinese

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Chinese

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Chinese

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Chinese

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Chinese

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Chinese

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Chinese

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Chinese

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Chinese

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Chinese

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Chinese

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Chinese

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Chinese

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
In my opinion

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Shuang Yu should

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
go further

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
rather than

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
looking for

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
so-called

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
non-exams

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
subjects

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
like sports, art, music

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
and so on

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
He is still learning

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Chinese math

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
calculus

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
biology

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and so on

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
When it comes to sports

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
he suddenly changes to bilingual mode

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This is a

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
very interesting question

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
If you look at it

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
from many perspectives

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
In Taiwan

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Shuang Yu

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
has a...

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Let's take a look at this chart

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Why is there so much discussion

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
in Taiwan

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
so far?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
There are basically three reasons

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Three perspectives

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The first one is

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
a mess

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
To be honest

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Shuang Yu is obviously

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
going to drop out of school

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Taipei City

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
will announce 100%

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Shuang Yu will drop out of

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
high school

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
In fact, they are also

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
moving in this direction

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
All schools in Taiwan

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
have been

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
looking for

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Shuang Yu program

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Shuang Yu teaching

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
or Shuang Yu class

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
including high-level EMI

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So if you happen to be

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
in the United States

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
studying

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
In fact, before 2013

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
you were relatively smart

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Because you

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
People believe you can

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
EMI

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
That is, you can teach in full English

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But we

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
are from the same city

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
But more teachers

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
educate

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and learn

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
acquire their teaching experience

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
locally in Taiwan

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
So their Shuang Yu policy

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
There is no way

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
So in this situation

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
what I said

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Three kinds

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
One is a teacher

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
will say this policy

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Just kidding

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Opposed

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
The second is like us

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Because we think about its benefits

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
You get a lot of benefits

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
of these people

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Or you have seen

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That is,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
English can really

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
lead us

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
At least we can

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
quickly push ourselves

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
or learn foreign things

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
This is what we think is good

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
So YES

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
In the middle, he did not understand

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
He just like Wu Bing

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
will drift

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
In this case, you will find

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
that all policies are the same

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
He just voted

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I just finished voting last week

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
YES, I vote for you

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Or NO, I vote for you

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
All the same

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So I may

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
talk about this first

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The first question

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
In the end, Shuang Yu country

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
What are you doing

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Shuang Yu policy

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
This

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
He is not in 2017

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
He is in 2000

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
He is a think tank

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
in Hainan

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You go to read that

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Taiwan's English policy

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
In addition to our traditional understanding

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
English teaching

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Taiwan's English teaching

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I think it is quite successful

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It should be said that the so-called success is

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
We

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Our

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
English is at least better than Japan and Korea

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
At least better than Japan

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I don't know why

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Maybe because

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Our relationship with the United States

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Or

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Taiwanese

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Watch a lot of HBO

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Japanese should watch

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
This is learning English

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
English

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
But now you have to be comprehensive

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
To many subjects

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Even industrial

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
There are some banks in Taiwan

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
They are now holding Shuang Yu demonstration area

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The question is

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Why do we have Shuang Yu

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Is Shuang Yu class in English class?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
What if the teacher

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I can't teach Chinese

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
What to do

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
There are some teachers who want to do Shuang Yu

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Some are like us

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I think

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Where is the beef

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Is there any place

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
This is all

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
A very interesting

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So this question

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Everyone is like this

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Everyone has an answer

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Different answers

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But back to a

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Level of tool value

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The answer may be this

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Just for

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Take it as a

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Weapon

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It is a tool

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
It is a tool for communication

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It is a

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Our National Development and Reform Commission

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And so on

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Claimed

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Can let us sell to the world

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Especially the English class world

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Because they are still in the world

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Leading

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Whether in technology

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Or

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Leading on many systems

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
The so-called lead is

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
That is

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
They are stronger

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
To be honest

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It's all relative

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Then we can follow these

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Powerful people

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They can understand us faster

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it is good

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
This situation

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Why 2030 Shuang Yu

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Shuang Yu

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
policy

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
of course

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
This question

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
country

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
No special

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
You may have a bottom in your heart

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I just talked about two thousand years

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Tainan Gang

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Think of this strategy

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Then you

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Since Tainan Gang

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You will think of some color problems

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
That

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
in fact

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It is very clear that

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
He is actually

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
a

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Going to America

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Strategic policy

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
That is to say

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
No matter how much you talk about

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
But now

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Two months ago

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
We all know that Pelosi flew to Taiwan

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Then why not

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Li Keqiang is in Taiwan

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
My question is like this

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It means that Shuang Yu

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Policy is actually in

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
language

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Do you say

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Weakened Chinese

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Someone proposed

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Didn't we all say that Guo Wenke

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Zhou Wenke is even a university teacher

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Shuang Yu

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Of course he also has his thoughts

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But why did he let people

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Study English

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That is obviously

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Have his

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The consideration of our partnership

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Just like our New Southbound

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
He doesn't want to

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Put all the eggs on the shore

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
He wants

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
How kind

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Especially to report the correct answer

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So this is what you see

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This situation

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So this situation is

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
We want to say

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So you have to understand

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
In the end

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This policy

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
What are those people thinking

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
what

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
and so

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
This is also

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Then you think about it

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Then I want Shuang Yu today

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
What do I think about it

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Why is the environment so noisy

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You may have

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Think about it slowly

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think this is

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
This is a low part

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Then I personally feel

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Shuang Yu

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
For Taiwan

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The reflection of the education system is very good

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
because

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
He

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
We are talking about cross-fields now

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That is actually

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
English

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Non-English class

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
He is actually helping to some extent

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
English class

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
What is English class doing

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Our English class is actually

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Many are in

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Preparing for the exam

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Early reading and writing

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Writing words

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Understand grammar

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Write some short texts

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
In the past ten years

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Twenty years

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The country began to test

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Listen

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
But he still didn't get the number

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So it becomes our students

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Used to learn English

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So when it comes to real foreigners

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I can't speak a word

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
So I think Shuang Yu

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
At this time

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Not only expand his

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
English learning

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
In addition to imagination

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
He is also

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Will return to one

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
If you put it

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Think clearly about this matter

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
You will find out

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Teacher

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Can use the right words

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
To solve the problem of our long-term education

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Is to focus on the exam

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Instead of application

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Of course the exam is also an application

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But that is to say

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The exam is expected

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That may be three years later

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
That time

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Or the usual period

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
But I'm talking about the applicability

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
The breadth and depth is

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You may

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
In this situation

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
You may think in

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Ordinary

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
For long-term application

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Then international

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I think this is a

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Shuang Yu to

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
An opportunity point

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
This is probably the case

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
This question is a bit

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Professional Shuang Yu

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Teaching

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So probably

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Needless to say

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Take a look

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I should have a question

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Let me see

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I think it's still simple here

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Just say ok

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
If Shuang Yu

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Today

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
In

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Our purpose

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Everyone has a certain idea

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Then maybe a speech

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Can be done

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Then you will meet one

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
When Shuang Yu goes to class

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
In fact, if you

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I'm going to college

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
How to teach

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
In fact, it is called ENI

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Written here

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
But now

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
For example, you

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You have to put your subject in full English

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
In fact

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
This is also the case in the international market

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Many international schools

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm not talking about universities

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Research Institute

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
International

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
When everyone is looking for a job

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
ENI

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Then go to ENI

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
That's all

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
No competitiveness

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Of course, under middle school

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That is to say, he may have a lot of teaching

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Strategy

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Then use some of his subject

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Theoretical framework

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Then go to Shuang Yu teaching

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
This part of the domestic people are less talking

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's just me

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I can think of this thing

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Of course, because I have a book

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So probably this situation

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I speak faster

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Shuang Yu teaching

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
In fact, in the end

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
How does he say

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
He didn't say you think

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It's important that you do it

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
but

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
He wants to go back to a learning site

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Because we all know that students actually

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
The gap is very large

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
So there are people using that screen gap

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
He will expand

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Weakness

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
With that kind

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Their imagination is English

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Home is better

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So this one

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Cultural language

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What capital is pulling more

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
So when the teacher was on

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
There is also a

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Maybe he studied English

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
So he decided to read science

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Still have to read English

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Now Shuang Yu

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Simply put, it's actually Shuang Yu

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
He will meet one later

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Whether you are well prepared

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Can students accept

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Always a problem

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
So he is a teacher

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
A two-way interaction

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So you teach any class

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
You teach any client without Shuang Yu

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Also encountered this problem

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
So it becomes

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The reflection inside is very important

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
The teacher's sensitivity

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Because the teacher has power

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Of course now students

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
They start to have a say

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
They will criticize you

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So this becomes

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
This duality becomes important

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
But another level of Shuang Yu

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I also mentioned here

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It is also less mentioned in China

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Must consider language and culture

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Duality and equality

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
it is good

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Because many of us

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You can show English

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Very awesome

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
But this is a bit like

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's a bit like saying

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Self-respect

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Self-respect

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I think this mentality is very bad

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
A better mentality should be

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Equal to each other

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
For example, when we are today

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
When Shuang Yu was teaching

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Uh

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You see a lot of English teachers

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
When a lot of Shuang Yu teachers are in class

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
His blackboard is full of English

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Then he speaks a lot of English

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Then he tried to teach

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Well, that's fine

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
If you can absorb

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I will expand your experience

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
But I think Shuang Yu

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Another level is

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You should put your own good things

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Use the language that the other person understands

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Teach him

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Just this is called English

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So for example, when I go to

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Sports class

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
In addition to going abroad

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Some sports

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I will also work hard to teach students

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Put your own good things

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
For example, martial arts

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Martial arts

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
What do you know

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Teach foreigners

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
For example, this time you use English

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
You don't have to learn from others

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
But you have to put your own good things

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Teach others

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Even if we are in the United States

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
When I was studying in New York

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
When I was studying in Australia

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
We want to cook a Taiwanese dish for each other

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
That concept

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You know our good

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Then

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
You teach your good

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Hamburger for me

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I introduce my delicious

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I'll give you a pancake

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
This is mutual

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So language design

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Shuang Yu course design

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I will consider this

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Won't go over

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But they have to come over

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I think this part is quite important

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I also think this is

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is pushing the Shuang Yu course

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
There must be something local

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
International

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Local

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This thinking

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Ok now back to me

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Maybe

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Maybe these

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Maybe with us

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
This

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Because we all have the right

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
What is the current level of domestic and foreign Shuang Yu research

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
If you

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Some of you who come to listen today

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I think this is

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Probably the same

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That is to say, this is a very good graduation topic

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Because in addition to the journal

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
There has always been a need

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There are idols

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
P1

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
There is a need for this kind of journal

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
There are people who make people confused

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
We will use different methods

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
We will find different problems

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Then use different methods to solve it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Because it always has

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
A mysterious color

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
People will be together because

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I don't understand

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Ha ha

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
It's like this at the moment

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Shuang Yu

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Research in China

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
at present

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
There is

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Continuous output

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
That foreign trend

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Foreign trend

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Especially in the field of language

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
There are also many

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Then I have

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
If you look at this field

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think there is a very interesting place

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I will introduce one here

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Such a piece

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
This one is about Spain

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
One of their case studies

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
White Linguist

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I think this one is more interesting

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Because he

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Just like all research

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
In one

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
This kind

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Direction

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Will produce a lot

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Sometimes the opposite

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
found

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Basically he is talking about this one

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Will Shuang Yu

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Affect the amount of physical activity

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
This research question

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Ask this

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
That

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
In fact, the amount of physical activity

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Is the imagination of everyone in the gym

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I want you to come to the gym today

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I usually hope you have

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Exercise

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Don't say what kind of technology

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
You just

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Heart rate increase

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
To run a few thousand steps

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Sweating

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Then I think you have reached

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Certain requirements of the gym

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So his thinking is

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
If I come in today

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Will it cause this

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Positive or negative

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
What is their relationship

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Ask this

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
But this question

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
In fact, you use another department to ask

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
For example, I brought you in today

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Mathematical ability

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Does it affect the teaching section?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Wait a minute

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Will it cause good or bad

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
He asked you

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
So you can see from this one

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
He is

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Selected

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Some key words

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Then he hopes

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Students can achieve moderate

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Vigorous physical activity

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Medium strength

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Moderate

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
A little tired

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Physical activity

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Then he defined it as

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
MVPA

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The teaching mode he uses is

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
CLEAR

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Compton Language Integrated Learning

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
The so-called bilingual teaching mode

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Very popular in Europe

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Then he went to intervene

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So one of the groups is

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
CLEAR mode

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Experimental group

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Experimental group is normal teaching

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
The thinking is like this

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Then go

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Quantified to start doing

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
How does he do it

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
He just let the students

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Put that

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Maybe a calculator or something

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
He talked about that thing

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Measure his activity

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Then test

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
A few weeks

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Of course you

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
There is a fact of teaching

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
So he knows

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
He wants to invite

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
One of the participants is

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
CLEAR teacher

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Come to teach

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
That

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Before the result

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I thought they had another group

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Research

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
They found it would affect

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The so-called

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Obstruction

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Reduce students' physical activity

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
There was another team before

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's like this

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Because the amount of language is too much

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Leading to a decrease in student exercise time

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Is this side

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Hit him

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Hit him here

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
No

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Look at this

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
% of time per session spent on

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
MVPA

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Use CLEAR

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Do you see the average value?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
GENERAL

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
35.15B

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
The control group of CLEAR

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Obviously high

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
OK

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Probably

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
A lot higher

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Boys and girls have

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
His instrument

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
The amount is shown

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Very simple research

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Then he will explain now

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
This result

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Why is that so?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
The previous explanation said because the teacher

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Too much nonsense

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Language orientation

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
OK

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Let me tell you

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Because he used something

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This table

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
COMMUNICATIVE TEACHING STRATEGY

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
That is to say

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
What

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
The way the teacher uses

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
REFORCING THE MESSAGE

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
REFORCING THE MESSAGE

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
THROUGH THE COMPLEMENTARY NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION CHANNEL

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
That is

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
We say

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
When the teacher teaches in Chinese

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
So I'll tell you

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Use more

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
POSTURE, GESTURE

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Or EYE CONTACT

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
You

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Like this

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
NONVERBAL

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You can say this

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
This is one

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
His strategy

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
The second

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
ADAPTING THE LANGUAGE USED

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
TO SUIT THE STUDENTS' LEVEL

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
See people speak human language

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
See ghosts speak ghost language

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
According to the student's level

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
To adjust his

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
INSTRUCTION

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Even sometimes

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I really use bilingual

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Not all English

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
He may not understand this student

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
So he thinks this is

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Will make the student understand

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
That

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Another reason is that

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
But this has nothing to do with the student's level

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
His explanation is another

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Because of the student's attention

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
In order to understand the teacher's English

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Is there a student interview here?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The teacher explains something

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
We will pay more attention

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
OK

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
He said this

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
If we don't pay attention

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Then we

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
We wouldn't have been able to play

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
OK

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So the student should be very focused

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So his explanation is

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Because the student is focused enough

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Understand

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The student's physical activity

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
He justified

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
To explain why

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Physical activity will be good

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
So it's interesting

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
From my professional point of view

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I think this is interesting

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I dare not say ridiculous

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Because the previous article

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
The article talks about

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Because the teacher said too much

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
OK

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I want to say

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You didn't see the previous article

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
You can see it here

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
What is it called?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Physical

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Look at a good article

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
This may be Q2

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Tier 2 or above

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Q1

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Both are good articles

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Then

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
From my professional point of view

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I said that it can be published

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
What does it mean?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It means that the current research

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
This aspect

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
The gap is still very large

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Very large

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
This is what I mean

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So actually

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
At present, my understanding is

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Research on scientific research

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Mostly

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Besides review

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
What is the topic?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
What is the topic?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
This is one

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The other is similar to this

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Is

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Experiment

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Case study

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Accurate design

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Or

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
This kind of field

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Actual observation

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Then

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And so on

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Or the teacher himself

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Domestic is also doing

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
The teacher himself

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Design

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Design a course

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Then look at the amount of students' language

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Double language

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
See if his wisdom has improved

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Or learn motivation

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
This is one I have seen so far

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
But it has a lot of details

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Just this teaching strategy

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
He has a lot of scenes to play

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Because you are all teaching

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Strategy

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You just have a multi-fidelity

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Maybe another one will be made

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The problem is what do you want to do with this one

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
His

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
The contribution on the table becomes

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I have to look at the paper again

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
So this is currently

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I think

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I think he is a

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
If you are

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
This part of the words

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Can also talk

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Because cross-border double language policy

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Can also do

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Because some people have been misunderstanding

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Say

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Because the time is an hour

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I want to ask

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Do you mind

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Let's enter the Q&A time

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I have to finish

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
So what I mean

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
This becomes

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
He can do a lot

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Including national recognition

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Can do

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
He can do a lot of material

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So the conclusion is the front

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Some key points

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Everyone knows that the national strategy is like this

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We have to consider

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
How to use it

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Take it as your own

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Then because of the double language

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
After all, if it is related to the educational field

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
He is actually a

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's a science and art

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So if you order a meal, you have to go

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Figure it out

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Because I want to listen to the audience today

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Everyone is a talent

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I believe in the future

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Taiwan's double language

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
There has always been a chance

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
These detailed policies are still

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Especially in the second part of the country

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
The country is currently like

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
The teacher who wants to take the double language

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
He himself does not have a foreign language level

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
So this is a problem

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Then the science and art part actually has a lot of

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
There are many gaps and different directions

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It's worth it

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
It's worth it

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
To study

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
The above is my sharing today

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
With

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Five-point conclusion

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Thank you for your listening

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
There is no

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
How to face the gap between the rich and the poor

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I feel

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This is from social science

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
If I am a policy maker

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Of course I will hope

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Divide resources

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
To the disadvantaged

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
All the way

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
This is

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I think this is

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Not just in Shuangyu, many

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Many departments

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
There are also many infrastructure

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Do it like this

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
For example, there is a road here

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Do I have a road in the east?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Then you also see

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
It becomes

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I think this is all

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
The government is doing it, because now

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
In fact, this part of the home network

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Because in Taiwan

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Even Lidao, he has a network

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
So now there is

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Online, so he actually has nothing to do with Shuangyu

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Become resources

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Give you a computer

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Then there is a match for you, this is not a problem

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
He knows that talents can be sent to you

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I think this is the policy end

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Or the executor is doing it

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
He tried to do this

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
This is from a structural point of view

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Everyone knows the answer now

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Or go back to a

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Screen gap

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I am not very rich

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I am a middle school

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I am a middle school

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Our home

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Still personal

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Investment in Shuangyu

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
The psychological

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Should be imagined

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
No matter how much you give

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
No interest in learning

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
There is no way

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
So the screen gap

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Taipei

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
The resource environment is good

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
English is still bad

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So in a way

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Resource allocation or screen gap

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It's just a structural problem

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
It looks like a problem

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
The real problem is back to the executor

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
itself

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Did he block his antenna

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
This is my answer

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
What angle do you look at this

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
You should emphasize

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Just

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They have no way to

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Open that antenna

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Because we say there are many

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Many people are ignorant

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
So the focus is on

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Besides the policy

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Is there any possibility

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
More friendly environment

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
That friendlier environment

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Maybe it's not just

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Close this kind of

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You give him a flat screen

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Computer or

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Or a visual problem

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
He may have some

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Some other accessories

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Other problems include that

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Maybe because I know some

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Just

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Just

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
On the execution side

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Or say

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Students

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
If he is not interested

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
How do you deal with it

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
This is a problem that stimulates the group

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Colleagues and their own

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Some family factors

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
This is not a single face

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Can consider

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
This is the answer I can think of

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Then there is another one here

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Is the applicant

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
The problem is

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Although the education language and related areas

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
There is a lot of discussion about the bilingual education policy

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
But the public in Taiwan

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
The impact of this policy is limited

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
How should we make the public

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
How should we make the public

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
How should we make the public

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
How should we make the public

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
How should we make the public

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
How should we make the public

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I think Taiwan

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Taiwan

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
It should not only be bilingual

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Is everyone

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Because the common people are mostly

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I care more about his daily life

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
For example, you said

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You said that Caiqi

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Cai's stall

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
he

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Does he value bilingual

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Does he have a cell phone

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
But the news he may see

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
It's not what we care about

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
His same level as us

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Different

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
So if you say you

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
You want this bilingual

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Is to make everyone feel important

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Should be able to enjoy

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
His

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Sweet story

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
So I mean the bilingual policy

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Your propaganda

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I think I do a lot

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Because you are now in Taiwan

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
The street is full of bilingual

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Public transportation

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Excessive

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Our COVID-19 propaganda

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
There is also English

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
So I don't think it's in the media

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Or policy announcement

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
This part is not

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
But it is clear that Taiwan is doing it

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
But the problem is

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Because he has no way to let the general public

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
To use bilingual

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So I mean

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
If you ask this industry

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Bilingual policy is to open up

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
The opportunity for international talent to operate in Taiwan

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Because of us

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Talent

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It should be said that our current population

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Group

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
With that kind of culture

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Distribution is still local

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
This is what we are talking about

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
What this province

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Hakka

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
There are some new names

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
But we have fewer English-speaking countries

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You really have to distance

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
To let everyone know more about the necessity of this policy

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Just take Tianmu

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Tianmu itself is a

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Tianmu and Xinyi District

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Why was it built as a bank?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Demonstration area

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Because he is there

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
There are people from English-speaking countries

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
In this situation

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
He can't buy vegetables in Tianmu

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
He can't speak Chinese

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
He has to use

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
He can only speak English

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Then we say that we don't really understand these people

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
He has to use

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Appropriate English to interact with him

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
But you have to talk a little bit

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Then this is what I said

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Every day must

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
You don't have to promote this situation

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
He has to learn

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So in the long run

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Bilingual policy

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
What we are doing now

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
How do we let talents come in?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
English-speaking willing to come

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Then he can

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Live everywhere in Taiwan

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Work

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and so on

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Then naturally we were talking about those

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
People who don't really understand him

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Let me go to Australia

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
You are in the United States

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
There are Indians around

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
There are

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Anyway, non-Americans

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Then we all have to

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Communicate in the same language

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
If it is like this in Taiwan now

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
We communicate in the same language

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It's called Chinese

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
But now there is one more

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
The second language is English

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Then he will

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Become a must

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
That's called Affordance

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Because there are many foreigners

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Now it's called Guangdong

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But in case the future is long-term

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Then it will become a

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Let's take the past

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Taiwan speaks more Minnan language

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Later

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
The civil war retreated

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Chinese

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Mandarin becomes

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
To speak like this

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Then it will be mingled

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
That's how it is now

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
So the policy

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Too much is just an expression

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
The reality is

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
People come in

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
He lives here

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
We naturally understand

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
The necessity of bilingual

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
This is

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Can go longer

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
That's another way

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I want to add

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Of course this process needs to wait

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And then the other

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
During this waiting

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Our bilingual skills in the cloud

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Express

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
B

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Sentence pronunciation

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Use words

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Will

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Inevitably run out of Taiwan

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
English or bilingual

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I am with

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Domestic education ideas are the same

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
This is

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
reasonable

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Bilingual development direction

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
So this is also

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Also OK

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
This is the specific

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That is

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Our Taiwanese bilingual

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Taiwan is bilingual development

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Will

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Is there a line with Singapore?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
With Europe and Spain

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Or many regions

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Achieve bilingual and different

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Direction of cultural scenery

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
above

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Thank you

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Does anyone have any questions?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
If you want

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
You can turn on your microphone

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Speak like this

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
If not

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Let's end the video

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Thank you

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
See you next time

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Bye
