1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I graduated from NTU's Agricultural Department.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm not here to promote NTU's Agricultural Department,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but I just want to let everyone know

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
why I do this

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and what kind of background it has with us.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, many people may not have heard of NTU's Agricultural Department.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Many people have heard of Yuan Yi Department

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or other Department of Insectology,

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or the Department of Science and Technology in the Agricultural Department.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But you may not know much about the Agricultural Department.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But for me,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think the coolest thing about the Agricultural Department

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is that it studies

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
how to understand the science of our crops.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, you see, I put here

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
some of the main grains in the world,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and some of the grains that Taiwanese may not be so familiar with.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, corn is very familiar to everyone in Taiwan.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Wheat may not be so familiar.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There are all kinds of beans.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, it should be wheat.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Taiwan may be more familiar with rice, rice,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or potatoes, which are not commonly eaten, but may be the main potatoes.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In fact, these are all in the field of agricultural research.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, what we can study includes their genetics,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that is, we can study which genes have which functions

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that may help these plants grow more.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We know which genes make these plants bloom early,

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
bloom late,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and which genes make it more resistant to water,

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
drought, or other pathogens.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is what the genetics want to find.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Another part is biology.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There is another group of teachers and students in the Agricultural Department

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
who want to know, for example,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
how the plants react to water.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It may make it grow taller,

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or it may have some compounds in it

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that can fight these pathogens.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Or, for example, when there is not enough nutrients,

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what method does it need to use

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to make these plants grow better in this bad environment?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The last part is statistics.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Statistics is because we need to do experiments,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but we need to have a conclusion that

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the results of the experiments I did today

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
are true or false.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it because I just did a lot of experiments,

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and I just saw this result,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or is it really because some species may really grow taller than other species,

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
or some species really produce more rice than other species?

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We need to use statistics to verify our results.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So these are what the Agricultural Department does.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But for me, I think the most interesting thing is

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
how we improve different crops.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, like we just talked about,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
corn, rice, these are what Taiwan often does.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just like Taiwan has been doing a lot of improvement factories,

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we use different ways to improve these crops.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is what I'm most interested in in the Agricultural Department,

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and honestly,

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
this is also a topic under this framework.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In fact, the improvement of crops is not just what we think of now.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For example, we may want higher corn,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
sweeter corn, or richer rice,

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
or more nutritious rice.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
These things were actually done by people

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
thousands or tens of thousands of years ago.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So in the picture on the left,

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you can see that this T-head is actually the ancestor of corn.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then you will see that the one on the right is our current corn.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can see that corn used to be a lot different from now.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There used to be a lot of branches,

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and each branch would bloom.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now the corn is a branch,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and there are only two of them.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Maybe one or two of them is the portion of the corn,

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
which is the part of the corn that we often eat.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So this is actually what the farmers or people in the past

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
were doing to improve the corn.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So through selection in the field or in nature,

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
they found that some corn could only grow one tree,

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and then they would leave it and continue to grow it,

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to see if they could continue to see this kind of performance in the next generation.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Gradually, after generation after generation of selection,

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we let the corn from this kind of

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
originally only one,

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
one piece,

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and then there are several seeds,

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
slowly become what we see now.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And the old corn,

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it actually has a very hard shell on the outside.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In fact, it is very difficult to eat when eating.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's how it is.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
After many generations of selection,

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it slowly became what we see now.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This corn has only one main piece,

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and then there is a very full portion of corn,

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then there are a lot of granules on it.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is through generation after generation of selection,

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we select those corn that are closer to what we want generation after generation,

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and then pass it on to the next generation,

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to slowly improve this corn

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to the ideal state we feel now.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So it's actually similar on the rice.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you look at the earliest rice ancestors,

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
it's actually like grass.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's laid on the ground,

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and then its seeds may have different colors,

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
such as red or deep purple,

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
just like the purple rice you see now.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But that color may be on its shell.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The rice we eat now is the white rice inside after the shell has been peeled off.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But in fact, it has its shell on the original rice.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The shell of the rice that was grown before may be red,

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
because when it fell into the soil,

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it would not be so obvious,

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and it would not be eaten by birds and so on.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In addition,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the earliest wild rice

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
may still have a very strong landing.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
After it blooms,

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
it will easily fall off from its shell.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So as long as you peel it off,

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the seeds will fall off.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is to make it easier to spread

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and pass on when it is in the wild.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But this thing will be very inconvenient for our people to harvest.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just like the 10-year-old rice,

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
after you harvest it,

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you may only harvest 50% of the rice,

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
but the rest of the percentage will all fall into the field.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There is no way to harvest,

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and it becomes the yield that you can easily harvest.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So,

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
like this,

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
this kind of feature with a high landing

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
has also been regarded as a target for selection for a long time.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We will start to select those mature rice

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
that are easier to stay on the rice plant.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then keep it and continue to plant it.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I hope to see the rice that we grow generation after generation.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
After maturing,

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
its shards are left on it instead of falling off.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So this is actually

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
from a long time ago.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
After we started planting these crops,

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
people thought about improving the crops.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it has evolved to the present.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In fact,

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the matter of crop improvement is

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
very common,

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
very common in our various environments.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
For example,

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the photo I want to put here is

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the different shapes of each tomato.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So you can see that there are different colors,

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
different fruit shapes,

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and different hardness and different shapes.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This tomato is actually

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the diversity of tomatoes themselves.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In fact,

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the wild tomatoes outside

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
have these different polygons.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's just that we cut it all up now.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Then you can see that

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
even in this species of tomatoes,

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it also has such different characteristics.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What does this mean?

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This means that

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you have this diversity.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In fact,

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we can use a lot of things.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For example,

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
today,

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
everyone thinks that big tomatoes can't be eaten.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then we start to

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
start to breed tomatoes

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
with smaller fruit shapes.

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We find smaller tomatoes

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
in this way.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Then continue to breed.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let the later generations of tomatoes become smaller and smaller.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It becomes closer to what we think

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is just the amount of a meal.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Or you think that

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
if you see red tomatoes

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
on the table today,

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it doesn't look good.

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But in fact,

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
there are these yellow tomatoes in the wild.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then we will try to

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
breed these yellow tomatoes

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with red tomatoes.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can we leave some yellow tomatoes?

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then it becomes a fixed species.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
After that,

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
when we eat tomatoes,

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
there will be red and yellow.

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Or everyone knows that

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
if you want to eat fries,

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
some people will eat ketchup.

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
These ketchups are actually

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
selected by special selection.

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because it needs to be able to

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
be processed.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, it may need

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
some time to process.

210
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In addition, you may expect

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
ketchup to have some

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
special flavors.

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you will need to

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
take some special-flavored tomatoes

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and fry them

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to breed some

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
special-flavored tomatoes

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
suitable for processing

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
into ketchup tomatoes.

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So in short,

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
our idea of

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
plant improvement

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is actually

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to use these

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
different types of species

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that we already know

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to use this

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
different arrangement

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to combine the features we want

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and then breed these

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
species that we think

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
people want.

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So why are we

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
looking at

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Taiwan's oats today?

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This...

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This...

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay, so...

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In Taiwan, if you

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
buy a can of milk,

241
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
about 2 liters of milk,

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you have to pay $158.

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But after I came to the US,

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was surprised.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why? In the US,

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
this is about 4 liters of milk.

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It only costs about

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
$100.

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is the price before tax,

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but as long as it's about

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
$100,

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
you can buy the same amount of milk.

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This price difference...

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When I came to the US,

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was surprised.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why is Taiwan's milk

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
so expensive?

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I know that in Taiwan,

259
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
for example,

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Taiwan's market is relatively small.

261
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Or in Taiwan,

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Taiwan's cows are imported.

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Cows may not be native to Taiwan,

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
so it's more difficult to take care of them.

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But why is it so expensive

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to raise cows in Taiwan?

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then,

268
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
how come the production cost

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
of these fresh milk

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is so high in Taiwan?

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So actually,

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Taiwan's fresh milk

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Taiwan's fresh milk

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
production cost is very high.

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of course,

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
it doesn't matter

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the various reasons I just mentioned.

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For example,

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Taiwan's market is relatively small.

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Or Taiwan's milk cow...

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Taiwan's environment is hotter,

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
so it's not suitable for milk cow production.

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
These are all related.

284
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But from the perspective of agriculture,

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
there is one thing

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that we can...

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
that we can

288
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
take advantage of,

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
which is

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
the issue of pasture.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In Taiwan,

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
there are a lot of these

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
livestock industry,

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
such as

295
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
sheep

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and cattle.

297
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In fact,

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
they need a lot of

299
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
pasture every day

300
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to feed

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
these animals.

302
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So,

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for example,

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
if I remember correctly,

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the amount of pasture

306
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for sheep and cattle

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is actually ten times less.

308
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For example,

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
if your sheep

310
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
eat five kilograms a day,

311
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
your cow

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
will eat 50 kilograms of grass a day.

313
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So,

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
in fact,

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
these cows and sheep

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
have to eat every day.

317
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In addition to eating feed,

318
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
they must also need

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
some

320
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
fiber.

321
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whether it's dry grass

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
or fresh grass,

323
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
these cows can eat it.

324
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In addition,

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
since they are all animals,

326
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
they can't just eat that feed.

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That feed is

328
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
without fiber.

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There is no way

330
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
for them to reproduce.

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So,

332
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you must provide

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
some

334
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
fresh grass

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
or dry grass

336
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so that these cows can eat

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and then reproduce.

338
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is one of the

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
normal

340
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
breeding

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
recipes

342
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
they normally

343
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
feed.

344
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But the problem is

345
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
that

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you can see

347
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the news

348
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I got today

349
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
says that

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
currently,

351
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the imported

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
pasture

353
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is 12 yuan per kilogram.

354
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you produce

355
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Taiwan's own

356
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
pangula grass,

357
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it's about 6 to 7 yuan.

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It means that

359
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the imported

360
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is actually

361
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
twice the price of Taiwan.

362
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This is actually

363
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the news

364
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of 2016 and 2017.

365
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
As far as I know,

366
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
the price of

367
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Taiwan's imported

368
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
pasture

369
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
has always been

370
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
higher and higher.

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The reason is, of course,

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
regardless of

373
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the cost of transportation,

374
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the price of oil

375
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
is getting higher and higher,

376
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or the cost of

377
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
production abroad

378
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
is getting higher

379
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and higher,

380
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
etc.

381
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So,

382
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the price of

383
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
imported

384
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
pasture

385
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
has always been

386
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
higher and higher.

387
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So,

388
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Taiwan has always

389
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
hoped that

390
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we could

391
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
produce our own

392
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
pasture

393
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to meet

394
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
the needs

395
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
of Taiwan's

396
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
own

397
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
pasture industry.

398
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But you can see

399
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that

400
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it seems that

401
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Taiwan can

402
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
rely on

403
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
different types

404
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
of grass

405
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
or different

406
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
types of grass,

407
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or like

408
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
corn can

409
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
also be

410
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
one of the

411
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
sources of

412
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
feed.

413
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So,

414
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
why does

415
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Taiwan still

416
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
need to

417
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
rely on

418
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
these

419
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
imported

420
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
pastures?

421
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The reason is

422
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that

423
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
when you

424
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
plant

425
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
those

426
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
pasture

427
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
plants,

428
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
they need

429
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
enough

430
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
dryness.

431
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So,

432
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in Taiwan,

433
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
for example,

434
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the area with

435
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the most

436
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
pastures

437
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
is in

438
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yunlin and

439
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Chiayi.

440
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So,

441
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
they can

442
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
plant some

443
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
dry grass

444
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
that they

445
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
eat.

446
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But

447
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
when they

448
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
harvest,

449
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
for example,

450
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
if they

451
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
plant in

452
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
summer,

453
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
they may

454
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
encounter

455
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
typhoon season.

456
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So,

457
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if they

458
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
plant in

459
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
winter,

460
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
they

461
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
may encounter

462
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
typhoon season.

463
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So,

464
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the reason

465
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
why

466
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we need

467
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to

468
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
rely on

469
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
these

470
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
imported

471
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
pastures

472
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is because

473
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
of the

474
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
weather.

475
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Even if

476
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you have

477
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
some grass

478
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that can

479
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
grow in

480
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
summer,

481
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
when it

482
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
grows in

483
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the winter,

484
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
it

485
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
may not

486
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
grow

487
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in the

488
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
summer.

489
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So,

490
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
one of the

491
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
reasons

492
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
why

493
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Taiwan

494
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
cannot

495
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
grow

496
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
grass

497
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
in a

498
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
stable

499
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
way is

500
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
because

501
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
it is

502
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
too wet

503
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and

504
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
cold

505
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in

506
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
the

507
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
winter.

508
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So,

509
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we

510
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
cannot

511
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
find

512
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
grass

513
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that

514
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
can

515
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
grow

516
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
in

517
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the

518
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
winter

519
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
in

520
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the

521
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
winter.

522
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So,

523
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
we

524
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
cannot

525
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
find

526
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
grass

527
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that

528
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
can

529
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
grow

530
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
in

531
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the

532
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
winter.

533
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So,

534
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
we

535
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
cannot

536
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
find

537
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
grass

538
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
that

539
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
can

540
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
grow

541
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
in

542
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
the

543
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
winter.

544
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So,

545
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
we

546
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
cannot

547
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
find

548
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
grass

549
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
that

550
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
can

551
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
grow

552
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in

553
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the

554
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
winter.

555
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So,

556
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
we

557
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
cannot

558
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
find

559
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
grass

560
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
that

561
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
can

562
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
grow

563
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
in

564
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the

565
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
winter.

566
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So,

567
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
we

568
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
cannot

569
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
find

570
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
grass

571
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that

572
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
can

573
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
grow

574
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
in

575
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the

576
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
winter.

577
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So,

578
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
we

579
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
cannot

580
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
find

581
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
grass

582
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that

583
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
can

584
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
grow

585
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
in

586
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the

587
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
winter.

588
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So,

589
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we

590
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
cannot

591
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
find

we

1228
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
cannot

1229
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
find

1230
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
grass

1231
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that

1232
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
can

1233
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
grow

1234
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
in

1235
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the

1236
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
winter.

1237
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So,

1238
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
we

1239
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
cannot

1240
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
find

1241
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
grass

1242
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that

1243
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
can

1244
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
grow

1245
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
in

1246
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
the

1247
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
winter.

1248
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So,

1249
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
we

1250
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
have

1251
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
a small

1252
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
pocket on

1253
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
top of

1254
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
it,

1255
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and

1256
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
we

1257
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
wrap it

1258
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
in a

1259
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
transparent

1260
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
plastic bag

1261
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
to

1262
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
keep

1263
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the

1264
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
seeds

1265
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
moist

1266
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
so

1267
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that

1268
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
they

1269
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
can

1270
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
grow

1271
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
in

1272
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
the

1273
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
winter

1274
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
smoothly.

1275
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So,

1276
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
when you

1277
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
put it

1278
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
in the

1279
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
water,

1280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
it will

1281
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
quickly

1282
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
absorb

1283
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the

1284
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
moisture.

1285
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
When

1286
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the seeds

1287
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
germinate,

1288
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
they

1289
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
can

1290
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
grow

1291
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
in

1292
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
the

1293
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
water

1294
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and

1295
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
absorb

1296
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
enough

1297
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
moisture

1298
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to

1299
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
grow.

1300
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So,

1301
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
we

1302
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
plant

1303
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
different

1304
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
seeds

1305
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
in

1306
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
different

1307
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
environments.

1308
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So,

1309
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we can

1310
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
make sure

1311
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that

1312
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
at least

1313
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
when I

1314
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
let them

1315
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
germinate

1316
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and measure

1317
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
their

1318
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
growth rate,

1319
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
they will

1320
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
grow in

1321
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the same

1322
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
environment.

1323
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I can

1324
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
control

1325
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the factors

1326
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
of this

1327
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
environment

1328
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
so that

1329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
everyone

1330
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
can compare

1331
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
on the

1332
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
same

1333
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
scale.

1334
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So,

1335
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
this is

1336
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
one

1337
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
seed at

1338
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
a time.

1339
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I

1340
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
put them

1341
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
in the

1342
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
germination

1343
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
gap

1344
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
so that

1345
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
they can

1346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
grow

1347
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
in

1348
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the

1349
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
same

1350
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
way.

1351
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
When

1352
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we were

1353
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
testing,

1354
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
if you

1355
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
just

1356
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
put the

1357
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
seeds

1358
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
in

1359
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the

1360
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
growth

1361
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
gap,

1362
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
we

1363
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
can

1364
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
measure

1365
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
their

1366
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
growth

1367
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
rate.

1368
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So,

1369
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
we put

1370
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
them in

1371
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000

1376
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and

1377
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
let

1378
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
them

1379
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
grow

1380
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000

1381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000

1383
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
way.

1384
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
When

1385
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
they

1386
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000

1387
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000

1390
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
we

1391
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
put

1392
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000

way.

1407
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
When

1408
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
they

1409
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000

day,

1413
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
we

1414
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
put

1415
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
them

1416
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
in

1417
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000

1430
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So,

1431
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
this is

1432
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
how we

1433
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
put

1434
