00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on July 23, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today's speech is given by Yan Ziqi.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The title of his speech is

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ziqi is a doctoral candidate from the Department of Computer Science at Colorado University.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He is interested in complex systems and the relationship between data, models, and algorithms.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He gave a speech at Taira two years ago.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please welcome Yan Ziqi.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello everyone.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you Jason for the introduction and thank you Taira for designing this platform for us to share our research.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll share my screen now.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll start.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My topic is Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This network is not the Internet. It's a network with many nodes.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There is an interaction between the nodes.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's called a network in English.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The main content comes from a paper I wrote last year.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I spent a lot of time listing all the references in this slide.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Can you see my mouse?

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can download my slides here.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you see this speech on YouTube, please go to my personal website.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This link will not exist in the future.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There are some things I need to update.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But all the references in this slide have a button.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You can click to see which paper I refer to.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So what is data analysis on the Internet?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This field often asks questions from data.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Data in a complex system.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Data can be, for example, brain science data.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
For example, we do brain imaging.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There may be some brain areas in the brain.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We treat the brain area as a node.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There may be some nodes.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Different brain areas will light up at the same time.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It works at the same time.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We can connect it.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is a network.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can ask some questions above.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For example, the structure of the brain area under different nodes.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What is the difference in the structure of the brain area?

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
For example, the ecological system.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can imagine that if we put each creature.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Between creatures, who eats who?

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Then there is a food chain.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is also a network.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The chain is a tree.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But if it's a network, it's a food network.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Other types, like what we usually see on the Internet.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There is a network between different web pages.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Then we travel, we go to different places.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It also forms a network.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Or a network between people.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This article is an explanation.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How to choose the right model when describing these complex systems.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because some functions.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Some functions may be between two.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Like a graph in math.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Like this.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Between one point and another point, there are two functions.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But sometimes, for example, we just said that the example of the brain area.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We have a stimulus.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There may be three different areas of the brain area that light up at the same time.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
At this time, we have three points that work for each other.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
These things may be more suitable.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Described by the so-called Higher-Order Network Analysis.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, uh, this article talks about some, uh, different, uh, data.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How could there be some higher-order things in it?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then, uh, uh, what model to choose, and so on.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, uh, my report today will focus on, uh, this single-body review.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's called Symbiotic Complex.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right, and if there's any questions, you can interrupt me.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, and I don't know what you think of when you hear Network Science.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And then, um, this is a recently published book.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then, uh, the last chapter talks about, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Talk about, uh, how to look forward in network science, and so on.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then he sorted out some different areas of the last 20 years.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Um, this is the field of paper, and then the number of them.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then we can see, for example, uh, about infectious diseases.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Infectious diseases are, of course, a thing that has to do with the Internet.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's a lot of that in the last year or two.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, um, um, what I'm going to talk about today is more on this high-level Internet.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's Hypergraph or, uh, Symbiotic Complex.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Um, there's been a lot of that recently, but not as much as, uh, uh, Epidemic.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, um, there's a lot of the same kind of numbers.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, um, if you're interested, you can look it up.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then, uh, I'm with, uh, uh, Li Zhengde from the University of Chenggong.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The teacher also translated a small book.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then this is also a link that you can click on.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can, uh, it's Chinese, and then there's a lot of examples.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You can click on it.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So, um, before I start this talk, I want to thank my instructors.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have two instructors, Josh and Dan.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then they, um, I'm from Computer Science.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then, but they, uh, they have a strategy in math and biology.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, um, I'd like to thank the authors of this paper.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Especially, uh, Ronga and Aleche.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because, uh, I was communicating with the two of them.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And then I found out that, uh, they did this article.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There's a, there's an open problem.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And then, um, um, so I started doing this open problem.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, um, now we're going to talk about what I just said.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There are some, uh, uh, ways to describe a complex system.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And then I try to list, I try to divide it into three types.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Uh, graph, or this.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hypergraph, or this.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's it.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Um, these three things are actually a, uh, a model choice.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That is, what data do you see?

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can choose which model you want to use.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then you use that model.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Maybe you get the benefits of using that model.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But maybe you lose some of the other properties.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, uh, uh, uh, this is a very good paper.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Uh, it should be used.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Uh, what kind of data should be used at what time?

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, uh, let's say, uh, I see a data today.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Um, it's the data from the author and their paper.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that's actually what it is.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Which papers were issued by which authors?

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, what about this data?

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Um, his, uh, input is, is determined.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That is, um, um, I know which authors I have in my data.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But, uh, because I want to ask different questions.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can have different, uh, data, uh, data representation.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
For example, I can ask, uh, these two authors.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Have you ever written a paper together?

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So this is you choose two people.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And then they have written a paper.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then you put it together.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
At that time, you will get this data.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can see if 1 and 2 have written a paper.

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And then there's writing on it.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
2 and 4 have written a paper.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then there's a lot here.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For example, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3 also have.

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 3, and then 3 and 4.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's it.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That kind of data is a, uh, a graph.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a graph.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then, um, you can ask a little more detail.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For example, you say, do these people have, um, is to write a paper.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, at this time, there's something called HyperEdge.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The extension of Edge is called HyperEdge.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because in Edge, you have to choose two points.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But in HyperEdge, you can choose n points.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
At this time, you choose.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In fact, it is four pieces of paper.

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You choose four.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
1, 2, 2, 4, and then 1, 2, 3.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because now it's, uh, HyperGraph.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So you can choose to come in.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's it.

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Then there's a HyperGraph at this time.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then, um, you can also use Simplicial Complex to describe.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Um, this Simplicial Complex to describe.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's asking, uh, um.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a little, a little rough.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, um, uh, these people have written a piece of paper.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So, at this time, he's actually like HyperGraph.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He just chose n people up.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then it's called a Simplex.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But this Simplicial Complex has a definition in math.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's defined as, um, you.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
After choosing a Simplex.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're going to put all the smaller, um, all the smaller Simplexes.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
All the Simplexes are included in this, this Simplicial Complex.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For example, an example is if I choose 1, 2, 3.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For example, 1, 2, 3, this, this, um.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Everyone writes paper.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This thing is a, uh, a Simplex.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's in this data.

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have to include 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 3.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mathematically, it's like this.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So, uh, if we have this data.

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In fact, it's in this Simplicial Complex.

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's going to be so many, so many.

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All the possible things are in it.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It looks like a very, very.

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a big construct.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And then, uh, it's because of his definition.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That is, all the smaller subsets must be included in it.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That, uh, that's because of that.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We can use the biggest Simplex.

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And then we call it Facets.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
To represent a Simplicial Complex.

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What does that mean?

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
For example, we see this now.

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It looks like a lot of this data.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then we can choose 1, 2, 3.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because 1, 2, 3 looks big.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
After you choose 1, 2, 3.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It automatically includes 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So, in fact, there are some people who can.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Uh, don't, don't choose it.

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then 2, 4 will be less than 10 and 30.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So, in fact, if, uh, this data.

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you want to use Simplicial Complex to express it.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You just need to say these three.

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Uh, these three Facets are fine.

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That, uh, so this time I'll get one like this.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
One, one expression like this.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's what I'm talking about today.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This work is more related.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There are some other, uh.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The term is called, uh.

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Degree Sequence.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or the degree distribution.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then, or, Size Sequence.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Uh, Size Distribution.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know what to do.

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think I'll use Side Sequence.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Um, what does that mean?

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Um, Degree Sequence is, uh.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If we look at the example of the picture,

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Degree Sequence is, uh.

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How many neighbors does each point connect to?

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
For example, this point is connected to 2.

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And then this point is connected to three neighbors.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So this 3, 2.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
3, 2.

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
These four numbers make up.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The Degree Sequence of this picture.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Um, this sequence is not important.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Because it's a distribution.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That, but, uh.

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This thing, if it's in this.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In the world of Simplicial Complex.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to be 1, 2, 2, 2.

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The reason is because, uh.

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This A1, this author.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He's only connected to one side.

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's 1, 2, 3, this side.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So, uh, he's 1.

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's like a hand sticking out.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then, like, this A2, this author.

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's connected to this.

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This 1, 2, 3, this.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Simplex.

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
With 2, 4, this Simplex.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So his Degree Sequence is.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Uh, his Degree is 2.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The above is the definition.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's about this.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Um, how to say it on a Simplicial Complex.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
His Degree.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What is the sequence definition?

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That, uh, related.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There is also a word called Side Sequence.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Um, that is to say.

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Every side of it.

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That is, every interaction of it.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What is its size?

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Uh, actually, I should list it here.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Um, because this is a picture.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This picture, every picture is.

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Uh, his Interaction.

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's made up of two.

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So this picture is a few sides.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are a few 2s.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For example, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is 5.

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
5 2s make up this Side Sequence.

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's it.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If it's Hypergraph, it's 3.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because there's a 1, 2, 3.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Interaction.

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
3, 2, 2, 2.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Uh, Simplicial Complex.

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because I have three now.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So it's 3, 2, 2.

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, um.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is there a problem with the current definition?

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay, um.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I.

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The job I'm going to talk about today.

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Although I will go through a lot of other related information.

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Uh, it's actually like this.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Um, I'm going to.

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
My job is.

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Suppose I was given.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Two groups of Sequence.

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
One group is.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
2, 2, 2, 1.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And then the other group is.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
3, 2, 2.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can I use these two groups?

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The sequence of integers.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
To find a Simplicial Complex.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Make it.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The degree and.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This.

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The order of size is just the two I just gave.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Sequence.

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Um.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Not all.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Find a structure like this.

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Can correspond to each other.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then I'll say I can't find it.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Then if I can find it.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's good.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll say why it's good.

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That, um.

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So we.

310
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes, I'm going to enter the next video.

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So now we see this.

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This Simplicial Complex.

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Because it.

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
All the little subsets have to be included.

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It looks like a very complicated thing.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But it actually has some benefits.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is my first.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Uh, the first interlude is.

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Um, insert.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let everyone take a break.

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The second benefit.

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There is a field called Topological Data Analysis.

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It can.

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Use.

326
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I include these.

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Smaller subsets.

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Then to calculate.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Some of the structures of this data.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For example, it has.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
A few holes.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Like I'll give you an example in a minute.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The cup actually has a hole.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Here.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I put a hole in this place.

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How to get the data.

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
How to define it.

340
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
How to define.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Find a way to describe it.

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And then describe it.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You have to find out how many holes it has.

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So that we can distinguish these data.

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What's the difference?

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
For example, like.

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Um, for example, I know.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Um.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Um, this is a.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is a paper, and then he is.

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Um, when the U.S. presidential election.

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Um, in.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Some small bacteria in each state.

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And then they might.

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Different bacteria, he might vote red.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Or blue.

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can I use it?

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Topology.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Find out.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Is there any.

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Special structure is, for example, a blue sea.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In fact, there may be some red bacteria.

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Um, especially like.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Vote for the Republican Party.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then, or just analyze this.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Um.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
All the papers that make up this data.

368
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What shape is there?

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Um, yes.

370
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Um.

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If you are interested in this TDA.

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can go to this website.

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He has a lot of.

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The.

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Talk is the same as Tyra.

376
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Um, invite people to share.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
After sharing, put it on YouTube.

378
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Then you can see all kinds of.

379
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Using TDA to study.

380
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Some strange data examples.

381
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The example I'm talking about here.

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can find it in this paper.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Reference.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Um, other than this.

385
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Topology is related to.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Um, put.

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The kind of picture I just said.

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The phenomenon that happened above.

389
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because of the picture.

390
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Um, it's a pairwise.

391
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Then extend to.

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Um.

393
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Not just pairwise, but three or four or more.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That.

395
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Um, he will have some examples.

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
In a very short time.

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Finished.

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That is to say, what interesting examples do they have?

400
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But most of the time.

401
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Um.

402
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In the past, in the world of graph.

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He will have some dynamical models.

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
For example.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
For example, there are two agents.

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When they are together.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What kind of interaction?

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
For example.

409
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
For example, I want to buy a watch.

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then, but I'm not sure what brand I want to buy.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Then every time I look at my friends.

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What brand of watch do they wear?

413
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then decide.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a majority vote.

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
To decide what brand I should buy.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This.

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is a model.

418
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The main.

419
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The main component is.

420
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Uh, you have to look at your friends.

421
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's the effect between the two.

422
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There are a lot of these two.

423
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The model of the effect between the two.

424
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Extended to.

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Uh.

426
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
More than two.

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The effect.

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then there will be some interesting phenomena.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So, um, this is.

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Um, there are some related papers.

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's all about this data.

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Back to my original topic.

434
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I just introduced.

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I just introduced the degree and size.

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sequence.

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Um, these two things are used to.

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Describe a.

439
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Symbiotic complex structure.

440
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So why do we.

441
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm interested in them.

442
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Uh, because these things are.

443
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's all very local.

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That is.

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For example, I want to go back.

446
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Can I come back here?

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's all a local structure.

448
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That is.

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't have to know all of me.

450
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What does all the data look like?

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I just need to know.

452
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This person has several.

453
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Several changes.

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Or say.

455
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
A group of three people.

456
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is a local structure.

457
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Then, um.

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We're interested in them.

459
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's because of these local structures.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe with them.

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
To do one thing together.

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There's a relationship.

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So we want to put them together.

464
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Establish a link.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That, um.

466
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What about this thing?

467
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because I often want to compare.

468
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm in the world of Symbiotic Complex.

469
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Then in the world of graph.

470
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Uh, everyone is like this.

471
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Asking questions.

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Um, in the world of graph.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's a model called Configuration Model.

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What does that mean?

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Um, I gave you a graph today.

476
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Then I know this graph.

477
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Inside the degree sequence.

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's just telling me.

479
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Every point he has a few.

480
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A few neighbors.

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This degree sequence.

482
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's a very local one.

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's it.

484
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Sometimes, this network, he might have some.

485
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He might have some properties.

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes, I'm not sure how special he is.

487
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Or is it that he's with this?

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The local degree has a lot to do with it.

489
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, I can use.

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Configuration Model.

491
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This network.

492
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Randomization is randomizing a lot.

493
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
A lot of different networks.

494
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But, uh, I ask for these different networks.

495
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Their degree sequence is all with me.

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The one I observed was the same.

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Then I'll ask again.

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Uh, in all the different networks.

499
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The nature I care about.

500
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The distribution of the data I'm actually observing.

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Uh, actually observing the data.

502
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is there any difference in this value?

503
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What if there's a difference?

504
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think so.

505
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Um, this one.

506
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The network I observed may be in this degree.

507
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Um, there may be some special places.

508
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Beyond the degree sequence.

509
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Special places.

510
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Um, need to be explained.

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This is an example.

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's like this.

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It is.

514
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Um, this is a barn spiral.

515
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A bird.

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And then, um, everyone thinks.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The color of it.

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
With it.

519
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The ratio of the mating.

520
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
There is a relationship, but everyone is not sure.

521
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What is the relationship?

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Um, they do experiments.

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Put this bird on top of the sensor.

524
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Then look at the bird in a space.

525
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Then fly.

526
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If they are close, he will connect a side.

527
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Then form a network like this.

528
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, in this network.

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They went to say.

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because he knows the color of each bird.

531
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Then he also knows the different colors.

532
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is there any interaction between them?

533
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So they just made this network.

534
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They will count them.

535
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The one between them.

536
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Correlation related to color.

537
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Then I got this.

538
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This virtual line, this part.

539
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
At the same time.

540
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Um.

541
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This piece of paper also took this data.

542
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Um, they observed this network.

543
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Random.

544
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Then every random component.

545
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Calculated this once.

546
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Pearson Correlation.

547
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Then get a distribution.

548
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Then so, um.

549
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So this one comes from this data.

550
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Observed.

551
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Then this one comes from this distribution.

552
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Um, you are random.

553
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Then you will feel.

554
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Ah, they actually.

555
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Ah, there is no difference.

556
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Ah, you won't feel.

557
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So it seems to be here.

558
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You won't feel that you are.

559
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Color Color Correlation.

560
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What's special about it?

561
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's more than the degree.

562
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Degrees can explain.

563
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Corresponding.

564
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If I observe another data.

565
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He may.

566
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Um, his Correlation is very low.

567
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
For example, if I don't know.

568
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Um, if there is another data.

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then you observe his color.

570
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Then you will ask.

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Ah, you will feel.

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Ah, why do I observe the data now?

573
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
With this one.

574
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
After this data.

575
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
His Correlation is particularly low.

576
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then because of this randomization.

577
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Is related to the degree.

578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You will know.

579
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
At this time, there should be some.

580
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Is beyond the degree.

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Things beyond the degree.

582
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Plays in this.

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Then we.

584
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Um.

585
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Is there a problem so far?

586
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Let me ask.

587
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I want to understand this example.

588
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Um.

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The picture in the middle.

590
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The number on it is.

591
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
How many lines did he connect?

592
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or what?

593
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The number on it should be his.

594
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The number of the bird.

595
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Oh, the number of the bird.

596
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Then.

597
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There should be a few times of interaction.

598
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OK.

599
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Then.

600
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The meaning of gray and white.

601
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Is their color.

602
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Um.

603
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
OK.

604
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Then the picture on the right is.

605
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
How did it come out?

606
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't understand. Can you say it again?

607
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
After we observe this map.

608
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh.

609
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
After we observe this map.

610
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We also have his color.

611
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So we can actually count his.

612
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Color color correlation.

613
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Then we calculate a number.

614
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But I don't know if this number is.

615
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Is it special?

616
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So.

617
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Um.

618
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
They said.

619
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let me see if I can put this network.

620
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I found a lot.

621
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ah.

622
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
With him.

623
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The structure is different.

624
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But the degree sequence is the same as other networks.

625
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And then on top of it.

626
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Calculate his.

627
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Correlation.

628
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then we got a distribution.

629
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then we can ask.

630
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In the end, I observed this data.

631
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Correlation.

632
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Is it special?

633
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
OK.

634
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Um.

635
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Then is this more special?

636
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Is.

637
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Ah.

638
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's with me.

639
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
How do I put this network?

640
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's about randomization.

641
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
At this time, he fixed his.

642
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
His degree.

643
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is.

644
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Fixed him every.

645
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Every bird.

646
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
In the end, with a few other birds.

647
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And then there are a lot of other different structures.

648
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And then ask.

649
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I observed this.

650
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Is it special?

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So.

652
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The middle of this example.

653
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Anyway.

654
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Doing this thing.

655
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But.

656
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Your.

657
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It means.

658
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You have to find.

659
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The same degree sequence.

660
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This thing.

661
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The thing that needs to be studied.

662
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Is this the conclusion?

663
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Correct.

664
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Ah.

665
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This paper is.

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Proposed a configuration model.

667
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You can randomize a network.

668
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And then he gave an example.

669
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Ah.

670
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
After you can randomize it.

671
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Ah.

672
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This ensemble can be used to do.

673
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Some statistical tests.

674
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
OK.

675
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So, uh.

676
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So if you only look at this piece of paper.

677
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You might only get a Pearson correlation.

678
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And then, but you don't really know.

679
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What's so special about him?

680
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So, in order to know his special place.

681
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I want to put the original data.

682
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ah.

683
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Fixed a few parameters.

684
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then make an ensemble.

685
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And then let's take a look at this ensemble.

686
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
All of the.

687
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Inside the Pearson correlation.

688
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Is not.

689
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Ah.

690
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
In fact, it depends on.

691
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I.

692
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I suspect he's with.

693
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What kind of parameters do I suspect he's related to?

694
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
For example, now I suspect.

695
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
This Pearson correlation may be related to.

696
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The degree distribution.

697
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It may be related to the degree distribution.

698
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So I deliberately fixed it.

699
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's take a look at this distribution.

700
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And then see if he's in there or out there.

701
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Any other questions?

702
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Ah.

703
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Then I.

704
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Ah.

705
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Ah.

706
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Ah.

707
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Ah.

708
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Ah.

709
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Ah.

710
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Ah.

711
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Ah.

712
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Ah.

713
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Ah.

714
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Ah.

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, that's the example of the bird just now.

716
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How many other birds do the birds have?

717
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Interaction.

718
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The Global Gravity of Opportunity.

719
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's a paper by The Biological Science.

720
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Its reproduction is likely to be related to the color.

721
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This is one.

722
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A global.

723
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It may be related to a local.

724
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
An example in a certain data.

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That ah.

726
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Another related question.

727
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If I.

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Only after getting.

729
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
After the degree sequence.

730
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Can I get from it.

731
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Generate a network.

732
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If I can.

733
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
In fact, it can also be used to answer a lot of interesting questions.

734
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
They are on the structure.

735
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And in.

736
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
In.

737
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Is dynamic.

738
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
For example.

739
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Ah.

740
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Ah.

741
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think this is more.

742
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Domain specific.

743
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm going to click on it again.

744
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
This.

745
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This link.

746
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But here.

747
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What I want to say is.

748
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well.

749
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Ah.

750
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Everyone will doubt that a.

751
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Everyone will doubt that.

752
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Can I.

753
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
From a local information.

754
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And this structure.

755
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Is there anything special about it?

756
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If you can't generate it.

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If I get a degree sequence.

758
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know how to generate a network.

759
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Then you can't talk about it at all.

760
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
On this network.

761
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What kind of structure is special.

762
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So being able to build this link is an important thing.

763
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Then this is the structure.

764
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then the second dynamic.

765
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What does it mean?

766
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Ah.

767
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Take that.

768
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm not an infectious disease expert.

769
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But in terms of infectious disease cases.

770
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Ah.

771
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Because we know that infectious diseases sometimes spread very quickly.

772
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's because some people may.

773
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Ah.

774
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
There is a chance in everyday life.

775
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Hundreds of people.

776
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But this is not our normal life.

777
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But in the data of this human network.

778
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
There are specific people.

779
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
His degree is very large.

780
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That.

781
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That.

782
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
In such a data.

783
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
In such a structure.

784
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We have to be able to generate this structure.

785
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
To answer this question.

786
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So we.

787
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There will be a model.

788
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Say it.

789
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
If I want to generate a network.

790
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Then this network.

791
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The distribution of the degree is very heavy.

792
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That is.

793
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You look at his.

794
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You draw a distribution.

795
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Ah.

796
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
There are only a few friends in life.

797
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Then there are a few people with two friends.

798
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
There are thousands of friends in life.

799
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This is a degree distribution.

800
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That.

801
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You have to generate a structure from this distribution.

802
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then you can be on top of that structure.

803
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Run the model of infectious diseases on that structure.

804
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's why.

805
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Be able to have a way.

806
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
From local information to generate a structure.

807
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It is also important because.

808
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Ah.

809
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
In this way, you can do some experiments.

810
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Ah.

811
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So this is what I provide.

812
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
About what I'm going to do.

813
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That.

814
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Ah.

815
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Go deeper into the topic.

816
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Ah.

817
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Ah, we just talked about this.

818
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The local thing is the degree.

819
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Then we have.

820
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Observe some data.

821
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Usually, after you observe the data.

822
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Ah, you have to get the degree.

823
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's very simple.

824
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
For example, you know you.

825
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You have a class.

826
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then you go to ask everyone he has.

827
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You think in this class.

828
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What kind of people are his friends?

829
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Then you will get one.

830
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The network of friends in this class.

831
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Then you have to go from this network of friends to get it.

832
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
His degree is actually very simple.

833
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Just take everyone.

834
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And then see how many friends he has around him.

835
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's it.

836
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This direction is usually simpler.

837
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That.

838
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But it's more difficult.

839
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
How do you.

840
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Every friend, for example, this class has 30 people.

841
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Then you give me one.

842
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Ah, you give me 30 numbers greater than 0.

843
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Then you can not create a network.

844
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is more difficult to ask.

845
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That.

846
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Correspondence is.

847
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
If you want to get this network.

848
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You have to randomize it.

849
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Find an ensemble.

850
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So that every network in this ensemble.

851
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
He has the same.

852
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Degree sequence.

853
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This thing is also a difficult thing.

854
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That.

855
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What I listed is everyone's work.

856
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Then you can click to see.

857
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's a little closer.

858
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That is.

859
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You get a simple complex.

860
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
How to randomize it.

861
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So that every one in this randomization.

862
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Ah, every one.

863
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Simple complex.

864
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
They all have the same.

865
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Degree and size sequence.

866
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That this.

867
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Ypvp17.

868
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Ah, just now.

869
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Ah, the one that inspired me.

870
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That.

871
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Why is this a problem?

872
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Ah, the same thing is in the hypergraph.

873
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That's how it appears.

874
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Why?

875
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Why would I do this job?

876
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The reason is because.

877
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They are in this paper.

878
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
They proposed a.

879
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Randomize a structure.

880
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Then they go.

881
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Explain that they are like this.

882
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Can.

883
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Can.

884
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Explore.

885
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
All possible space.

886
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
He has some mathematical arguments in it.

887
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But.

888
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What about this method? He has to have one.

889
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
A data is there.

890
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Then you can put that data.

891
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That's it.

892
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But he can't answer.

893
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Some questions like today.

894
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I want to have one.

895
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Theoretical.

896
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ah.

897
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Degree and size sequence.

898
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Ah, I want to know.

899
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
For example, my degree and size sequence.

900
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They are all the ones I just said.

901
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That kind of structure.

902
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Can I use it?

903
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
To generate a.

904
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A data.

905
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And then randomize it.

906
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
If there is no.

907
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's not easy for me to do it.

908
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They can only go.

909
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Ah.

910
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This.

911
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
To find a data.

912
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then randomize it.

913
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So, my job is a.

914
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
A work.

915
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I want to ask a question.

916
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I still don't quite understand.

917
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Ah.

918
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Randomization and this one.

919
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Find one.

920
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
One.

921
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But the first question is.

922
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You have a.

923
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
A degree sequence.

924
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Then can you find a picture.

925
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Ah.

926
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
This degree sequence.

927
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is this the place where you draw the green line?

928
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Is it?

929
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If it's just a picture, it should be this place.

930
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, sorry.

931
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Find a.

932
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Complex data.

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If it's a complex data.

934
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That's where I'm green.

935
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You just need to find one?

936
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Or you just.

937
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You just need to find one.

938
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The reason is that after I found this.

939
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I can use the method here to randomize it.

940
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's useful in statistics.

941
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
OK.

942
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But what's the difference between randomization and this thing?

943
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
My understanding is.

944
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Randomization, you don't have to.

945
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
From.

946
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You give a.

947
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Then you already know the degree.

948
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Degree sequence.

949
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You are from degree sequence to.

950
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Randomization.

951
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You have to find.

952
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You have to find a lot of pictures.

953
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Is that what it means?

954
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Ah.

955
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If it's.

956
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
These random algorithms.

957
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If it can be used, it must have a structure.

958
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
If you only give me.

959
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Two integer series.

960
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I can't go.

961
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
For example, to swap his.

962
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
His side.

963
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Then to change his structure.

964
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So this randomization process is.

965
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You have to give a structure first.

966
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Then he might do some swap.

967
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What is it?

968
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Turn it into.

969
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The same degree picture.

970
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The so-called structure is.

971
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like.

972
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like this kind of thing.

973
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I have to give me a structure first.

974
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Then I can use.

975
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Random algorithm.

976
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Usually related to.

977
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Swap side.

978
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
For example, swap two sides.

979
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Swap at the same time.

980
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Keep their degree unchanged.

981
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But if you don't.

982
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
If you don't have such a structure.

983
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You can't do it.

984
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
These things here.

985
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So the green line is equal to.

986
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm going to find the first one.

987
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Then we can start randomization.

988
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OK.

989
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Thank you.

990
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That's great.

991
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't think I have enough time.

992
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm going to talk faster.

993
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But I might skip some slides.

994
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I still hope I can.

995
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'll be done in about an hour.

996
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
To do this thing.

997
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
In fact, I didn't.

998
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Solve all the problems.

999
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The reason is because.

1000
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What about this question?

1001
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
He was proven to be a.

1002
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
NP complete question.

1003
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And then if you're doing research.

1004
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I usually tell you.

1005
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You can't actually find one.

1006
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The algorithm is.

1007
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It can be completely.

1008
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Effective and useful.

1009
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That's a shame.

1010
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But at that time.

1011
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I thought it was interesting.

1012
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, by the way.

1013
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's the thing.

1014
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Test two integer series.

1015
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Can you find one?

1016
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
This thing should be.

1017
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
A difficult problem.

1018
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I think the interesting thing is.

1019
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I was really going to draw a picture.

1020
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's like doing that reading.

1021
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's it.

1022
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
In the end, I used Excel to do research.

1023
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That's it.

1024
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This is the problem.

1025
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
For example, I give two integer series.

1026
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
One is 43321.

1027
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
This is his.

1028
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The series of degrees is here.

1029
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And then I give another integer series.

1030
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's called his size series.

1031
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's called 33333.

1032
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, my goal is.

1033
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
In this array.

1034
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Fill in 0 or 1.

1035
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So that his.

1036
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Every column is just right.

1037
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's 4.

1038
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
This is just 3.

1039
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Every row is just right.

1040
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's 3.

1041
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
In addition to this, there is another one.

1042
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Make this a problem.

1043
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
One of the difficult conditions.

1044
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's a difficult limitation.

1045
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's two.

1046
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They can't.

1047
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Can't.

1048
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
One of them is another.

1049
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This thing.

1050
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
This is from what I just said.

1051
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Simple complex definition.

1052
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I hope I'm here.

1053
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
These structures that show up here.

1054
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's already the biggest.

1055
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Simple complex is those facets.

1056
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's it.

1057
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So if I put 111 here.

1058
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But here, I still want to fill in 111.

1059
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
If you fill in 111.

1060
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This 111 is with the following 111.

1061
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Is each other.

1062
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Uh.

1063
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
One of them is another subset.

1064
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Or vice versa.

1065
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I can't fill in 111 here.

1066
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So this time I can only fill in 111.

1067
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Then jump one to become one.

1068
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So these two won't be each other.

1069
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Subset.

1070
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Suppose.

1071
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
In this line, I only need to fill in two 1s.

1072
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I can't fill in, for example, 111.

1073
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Because this 111.

1074
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's going to be wrapped up in this 111.

1075
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So at that time, I tried a lot of this.

1076
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Fill in 1.

1077
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Fill in 1 and 0.

1078
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And then add it up and see if you can add it.

1079
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Uh, they gave this number.

1080
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's what I just said.

1081
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The limitation is to make this problem difficult.

1082
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But I found some examples.

1083
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's actually very simple.

1084
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
For example, uh, if I'm here.

1085
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
All of this.

1086
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
If the input degree is all 1.

1087
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Then there are here.

1088
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Uh, 15.

1089
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So I'm going to have 15 1s here.

1090
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Then I can do this.

1091
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
111.

1092
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Then jump one to become 111.

1093
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Then jump another 111.

1094
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Then I can easily create one.

1095
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
A structure is in line with what I just said.

1096
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That one.

1097
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Degree size sequence.

1098
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So, uh.

1099
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
My.

1100
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What about this job?

1101
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I thought of one.

1102
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The algorithm is a heuristic.

1103
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Uh, in computer science.

1104
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The meaning of the heuristic is that you have one.

1105
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You have a rule.

1106
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Uh, every step of your algorithm.

1107
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You have to go.

1108
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The rules are very local.

1109
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
But.

1110
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Uh.

1111
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's very surprising that you can use this rule.

1112
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
This is a heuristic.

1113
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
There is no way to guarantee that it is the best.

1114
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But it can also be used.

1115
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Then we found that.

1116
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Um, most of the.

1117
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Input sequence.

1118
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I can use the algorithm that I will talk about later.

1119
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
To find an instance.

1120
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes, that's what I just said.

1121
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Add a key.

1122
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Um.

1123
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This thing on both sides of the input.

1124
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Good.

1125
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
After I finish this algorithm.

1126
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I will skip some slides.

1127
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Then talk about mine.

1128
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I think it's an interesting interlude.

1129
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Then I will wrap up at the end.

1130
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
This is my algorithm.

1131
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Of course I won't talk about this algorithm.

1132
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But, uh, his.

1133
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The idea is probably like this.

1134
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Uh, I want to try all the possible 0s and 1s.

1135
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But when I try it.

1136
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't want to try it randomly.

1137
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I hope that when I first started.

1138
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
My input.

1139
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I arranged it from large to small.

1140
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
4333321

1141
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Then this other size input.

1142
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I also arranged it in large and small.

1143
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
After arranging it.

1144
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I started from the top down.

1145
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Fill in 1 or 0.

1146
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But when I fill it in.

1147
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I want to say.

1148
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This degree is big.

1149
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Hurry up and get together.

1150
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It becomes a simplex.

1151
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So I'm going to start from the left.

1152
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Slowly fill in the lower right corner.

1153
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So every time I fill it in.

1154
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I have a rule.

1155
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I want to.

1156
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Get together first.

1157
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That, uh.

1158
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
When arranging.

1159
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I can also be sure.

1160
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, by the way, this is a.

1161
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Um, this is a recursive algorithm.

1162
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I see a wild here.

1163
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Then, uh, I have some conditions.

1164
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
In it.

1165
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Every time I fill in this 0 and 1.

1166
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Sometimes I can figure it out.

1167
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Sometimes I can know.

1168
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Is it wrong for me to fill in 0 and 1 like this?

1169
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
For example.

1170
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
For example, let's say I'm here.

1171
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I'm done here.

1172
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And then there's a 1 here.

1173
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And then, uh, here, uh.

1174
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Fill in another 1.

1175
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Then there's no way to fill in 1 here.

1176
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Because I already have four 1s here.

1177
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Then add it up and it's 4.

1178
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So if I fill in 1 here.

1179
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'll be over 4.

1180
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Then I don't have to try this.

1181
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
This is the condition of 1.

1182
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
If it's in this line.

1183
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So, in fact, every line is filled in.

1184
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Uh, don't go any further.

1185
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Some of the conditions I can know.

1186
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And then I can delete this option.

1187
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And then, so he's actually a little bit.

1188
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Stupid way.

1189
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I really want to put all the possibilities.

1190
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
All found.

1191
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's just that when I'm looking for this possibility.

1192
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I have a specific sequence.

1193
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And then, uh.

1194
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The interesting thing about this study is that this specific sequence.

1195
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's.

1196
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It's useful.

1197
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That.

1198
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We also have some in there.

1199
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Uh, for example, I.

1200
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I fill in one and then I.

1201
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Finally, I found that this road is different.

1202
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I will, uh, record that.

1203
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Ah, this road is different. I have a rejection.

1204
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Then if there are too many rejections, then I will give up.

1205
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Because I know this question is very difficult.

1206
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And then I don't want to.

1207
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Find all the possibilities.

1208
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That, uh.

1209
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Then I.

1210
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Uh, I'm going to do this part.

1211
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
This part is what I'm going to do.

1212
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
To do the test is what I hope.

1213
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I can find.

1214
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
All add up to 13.

1215
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
This whole series of all kinds.

1216
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So this is actually 101.

1217
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Add up to 101.

1218
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Add up to 13.

1219
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The whole series.

1220
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And then I'm 101 times 101.

1221
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
All the possibilities.

1222
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And then I want to run.

1223
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Uh, the algorithm I just mentioned.

1224
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Will he get it?

1225
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
A simple show is to get a simplex.

1226
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
As his output.

1227
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Or did I finally give up?

1228
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That, uh.

1229
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What about here?

1230
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What I want to say is.

1231
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
In fact, most of the.

1232
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Because, uh, here's a set.

1233
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm calculating how much time I spend.

1234
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And then my definition of time is how many times I have.

1235
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's backwards.

1236
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Uh, I was.

1237
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1238
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And then sometimes I might be in a certain meat.

1239
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I found no way.

1240
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'm going to backtrack again.

1241
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Backtrack number.

1242
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Uh, the number I was rejected.

1243
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I was rejected.

1244
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Some very simple rules.

1245
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And then I found this road is different.

1246
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Most of them are white.

1247
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Or this gray.

1248
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So in fact, most of the.

1249
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Most of the input is simple.

1250
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So here I'm going to say.

1251
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
In fact, most of the input is simple.

1252
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Ah, this one, I'm going to.

1253
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Jump over a little faster.

1254
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But this one is mainly about.

1255
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, this thing.

1256
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Uh, you can scale up.

1257
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
To, uh.

1258
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Add up to 1,000.

1259
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
This kind of, uh.

1260
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Simple complex.

1261
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It was just added to 13.

1262
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Now add up to 1,000.

1263
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Um, I can still.

1264
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Find it very quickly.

1265
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Some of the inside that.

1266
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Is it simple?

1267
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Uh.

1268
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
With the time I spent doing this.

1269
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So.

1270
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then I found that most of the.

1271
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The time it takes.

1272
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's pretty rare.

1273
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's within the time of the polynomial.

1274
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That's why I'm here.

1275
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
The next conclusion is.

1276
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Hey, this method is a useful method.

1277
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I can, uh, take it.

1278
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Uh, random input.

1279
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I can use it to find a structure.

1280
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I might need to give up some.

1281
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Because I can't make sure.

1282
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What did I miss?

1283
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Because the problem itself is difficult.

1284
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But, uh, if I have a large number.

1285
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I can still use it to do something.

1286
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Useful statistical things.

1287
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Okay, and then, um.

1288
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
With just.

1289
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So, um.

1290
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The progress of this paper is to say.

1291
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Uh, because I just said.

1292
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Uh, I'm looking for this.

1293
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
When it comes to structure, I hope.

1294
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Uh, those big friends.

1295
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You have to get together first.

1296
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So, uh, is there anything special about this?

1297
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Some structures were found by me.

1298
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So, uh, I'm going to calculate.

1299
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Um, this.

1300
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
There are a few holes in the structure.

1301
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So, this is a.

1302
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
In that topological data analysis.

1303
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
One of the standard methods.

1304
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
If I have a complex.

1305
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I can ask him how many holes he has.

1306
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So.

1307
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's a hole like this.

1308
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
In the middle.

1309
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So, um.

1310
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
If this hole is the number of this hole.

1311
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's a kind of thing.

1312
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It's called Betty Numbers.

1313
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And then he'll have all kinds of different.

1314
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Dimensional holes, for example.

1315
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Um.

1316
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Betty Zero is.

1317
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He has a few.

1318
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
There are two.

1319
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He only has one.

1320
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But he happens to have a hole.

1321
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So his Betty One is one.

1322
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And then Betty Zero is one.

1323
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
H2 is a higher-level hole.

1324
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And so on.

1325
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
it is good.

1326
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Start with love.

1327
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This is the second one.

1328
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Because this is just to say.

1329
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What I just said.

1330
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Um, that kind of heuristic.

1331
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
There are really some special structures.

1332
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Is.

1333
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Created by me.

1334
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
There is nothing.

1335
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It's not very scientific.

1336
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But he is.

1337
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
One of the features of this algorithm.

1338
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
This feature will help us find it.

1339
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Um, very scattered.

1340
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
With very few holes.

1341
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
This kind of structure.

1342
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That, um.

1343
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
What about the focus?

1344
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's not what this structure looks like.

1345
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But I can.

1346
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
To build a bridge is from.

1347
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Input.

1348
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Find a structure.

1349
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And then I want to use someone else.

1350
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Randomize the method to find an ensemble.

1351
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And then answer some questions.

1352
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So this is just doing some.

1353
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Capitalization is about me.

1354
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Some features of the algorithm.

1355
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Okay, and then.

1356
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
This is not an interlude.

1357
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That is to say, why do you have to count?

1358
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because, uh, sometimes.

1359
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
In fact, it is important to know how many holes there are in this data.

1360
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Take the one I just said.

1361
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Uh, in terms of the example of the brain area.

1362
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Uh, you can actually know that.

1363
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Uh, normal people's brains.

1364
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
In some specific structure.

1365
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The number of holes.

1366
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
With.

1367
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Uh, there are.

1368
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Um, external dropout.

1369
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A kind of neurological disease.

1370
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
The structure of the brain.

1371
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
These two.

1372
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The number of holes will be different.

1373
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
This is a.

1374
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Uh, there are a few holes.

1375
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Um, it might be useful.

1376
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Um, the other place that might be useful.

1377
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Um, uh, it is.

1378
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Uh, uh, it is.

1379
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Um, signal processing.

1380
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Signal processing.

1381
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Um.

1382
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
This thing is.

1383
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
To say, let's say a.

1384
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Data, this data.

1385
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I observed these.

1386
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
On a network.

1387
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This is all this gray.

1388
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's all a network, and then.

1389
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
All this is colored is the data I observed.

1390
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Then, in this data.

1391
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Because I am very clear now.

1392
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I see all the data.

1393
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I know there are two holes in this data.

1394
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Then, um, these two holes.

1395
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
In the structure is very special.

1396
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But I observed this.

1397
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This one with color, this arrow.

1398
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I don't know what it is.

1399
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Uh, what does it have to do with this hole?

1400
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That, uh, there is a way.

1401
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
That is, I can put.

1402
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
These observed arrows.

1403
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Projected to.

1404
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Two holes above.

1405
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
This is a bit like that.

1406
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The PCA that everyone learns statistics.

1407
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Because PCA will have two.

1408
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can put it.

1409
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Projected up, and then look at it.

1410
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
These two different directions.

1411
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Um, the information is not.

1412
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
The biggest explanation.

1413
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Uh, the data I observed.

1414
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Then, if you put this data projected up.

1415
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You will find that, uh, these three have color lines.

1416
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Be grouped together.

1417
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Then the other three groups together.

1418
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Then the other three groups together.

1419
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Why are they grouped together?

1420
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Because of any.

1421
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
In a group of lines, he has no way.

1422
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Don't skip this hole.

1423
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Deform to the side.

1424
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
For example, I fix these two ends.

1425
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Then I want to pull this rope.

1426
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I can't get around this hole.

1427
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I can only be in this place.

1428
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Just squeeze together.

1429
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, so, um, this is one.

1430
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Can be from, uh.

1431
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You can get some from your data.

1432
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Some of the things that are related to the collection.

1433
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
How to do things like this.

1434
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Then, um, this is.

1435
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
A.

1436
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
A small field called.

1437
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Signal processing.

1438
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Then I list some articles.

1439
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You can find some interesting examples in it.

1440
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That, um.

1441
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Finally, this video.

1442
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm going to skip it all.

1443
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What about this video?

1444
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's about, um.

1445
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We if we.

1446
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
If we limit our world.

1447
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's a network.

1448
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
If we can only see the network, then we.

1449
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
We care about some of this network.

1450
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Um.

1451
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's the number of holes.

1452
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So.

1453
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Uh, we.

1454
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And then we have some options.

1455
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
For example, if this network is getting more and more dense.

1456
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
In fact, we will feel that this hole will be more and more.

1457
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Because it's a network that's getting denser and denser.

1458
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So his circle.

1459
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
His hole is getting more and more.

1460
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Um, but this intuition can't be.

1461
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Completely carried out.

1462
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Uh, in the complex, because.

1463
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Uh, because of the one I just said.

1464
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The limit of the complex.

1465
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So, um.

1466
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
His.

1467
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
His.

1468
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The description I just said just came back.

1469
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
If it's a denser and denser complex.

1470
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
His hole is actually getting less and less.

1471
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
There are some of this.

1472
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Uh, some interesting things about the structure.

1473
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Interesting things.

1474
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Okay, so this is my final slide.

1475
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Um.

1476
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I think the most important piece of information is that we are now.

1477
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Uh, with this.

1478
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I developed this method.

1479
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It can be used.

1480
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
For arbitrary degree size sequence.

1481
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I can use it to find a structure.

1482
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Then I can use it at this time.

1483
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Uh, someone else's.

1484
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Uh, random method, random network.

1485
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Then you can ask some statistical questions.

1486
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
What about the second interesting thing?

1487
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Um, what I just said.

1488
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Uh, this computer science question.

1489
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
He has a feature called.

1490
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
This means.

1491
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Uh, if you go to Google.

1492
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
MPCompany will be on his.

1493
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Wikipedia to find this picture.

1494
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
In fact, the world in here.

1495
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's still very rich.

1496
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Maybe it's simple and difficult.

1497
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So he is.

1498
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Uh.

1499
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Uh, I have.

1500
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That algorithm is written as a.

1501
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Python package.

1502
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Just open a terminal.

1503
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You can use this algorithm directly.

1504
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
What about the last one?

1505
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I think this job has.

1506
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Uh.

1507
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
There are some problems.

1508
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's what I just said.

1509
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In fact, it should be.

1510
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
In general, it's a difficult question.

1511
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Why is there a.

1512
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Simple algorithm can.

1513
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Count to the inside.

1514
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Most of them can be solved.

1515
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So why is he so successful?

1516
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Um.

1517
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I haven't been able to.

1518
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Uh, answer this question.

1519
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What about the rest of the statistics?

1520
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yes, I can ask.

1521
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Um, if I.

1522
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
See a data, I can think about it.

1523
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Um, this data is related to it.

1524
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
After a few fixed parameters.

1525
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Randomized data.

1526
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Uh, what's the difference? Why is my data.

1527
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
May be with.

1528
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Uh, I think it should be.

1529
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Uh.

1530
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It should be some.

1531
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Um, parameters.

1532
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm sorry.

1533
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Um, I'm in this data.

1534
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I have observed some.

1535
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I think it's interesting.

1536
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Uh, I hope to know.

1537
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Um.

1538
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Is it really interesting?

1539
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So in order to know this.

1540
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I need to randomize some parts.

1541
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
That's a statistic.

1542
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Uh.

1543
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's a long question.

1544
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Well, uh, a little bit more.

1545
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Because, uh.

1546
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
This is a complex system.

1547
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
A related one.

1548
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
A question.

1549
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
In the complex system, we usually have some components.

1550
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That's his agent.

1551
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Uh, the local structure I just said.

1552
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
For example, I choose what kind of friends I want to make.

1553
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This is a choice I made.

1554
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But I'm the last.

1555
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Uh, the human society is a global thing.

1556
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's it.

1557
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Is there any data?

1558
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Uh, we can ask.

1559
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Uh, the link between local and global.

1560
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Okay.

1561
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Um.

1562
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This is my list.

1563
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Uh, I think it's useful.

1564
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And then, because today's topic is.

1565
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Uh.

1566
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Related to the higher order network.

1567
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So these articles are all with, uh.

1568
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's just some technical survey.

1569
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And then, uh.

1570
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I just talked about some data.

1571
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
How to calculate the structure of this data.

1572
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Uh, there are three useful.

1573
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Uh, link for reference.

1574
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That, uh.

1575
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Uh, I think this area is.

1576
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Network science field.

1577
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And then, um, he has some communities.

1578
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
For example, this net size is every year.

1579
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
A meeting will be held.

1580
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That, uh.

1581
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm in this.

1582
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Um.

1583
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Since.

1584
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
In this organization.

1585
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And then, um, they're every year.

1586
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Uh, we'll be here every year.

1587
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Some activities.

1588
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That, uh, we have a slack.

1589
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
If you're interested in joining, you can.

1590
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Write an email to me.

1591
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's useful.

1592
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
The other thing is, um.

1593
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
There is a seminar.

1594
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That, um.

1595
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Like Tara.

1596
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
There will be some.

1597
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
With network science.

1598
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Talk.

1599
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
That corresponds to this diversified.

1600
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Net size symposium.

1601
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay.

1602
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm done.

1603
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Thank you.

1604
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Thank you.

1605
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Then we can turn on the microphone.

1606
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Applause.

1607
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Ok.

1608
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That.

1609
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Uh, is there a problem with the audience here?

1610
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Uh.

1611
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Uh, I have a question here.

1612
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I don't know if I can ask.

1613
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Um, please ask.

1614
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Let me turn on the microphone.

1615
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Uh, the organizer.

1616
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Then, how are you? I am.

1617
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Li Xuanwei from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

1618
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I heard the speech last time.

1619
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It was two years ago.

1620
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Then it's still exciting.

1621
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Thank you for sharing.

1622
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Because we have a topic.

1623
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
There are also related research.

1624
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So I heard this.

1625
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I feel very excited to see if I can use it.

1626
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Our own research.

1627
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Then, uh, there are a few questions.

1628
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I want to ask Zixi.

1629
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
There are about three.

1630
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The first one is.

1631
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Uh, we.

1632
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
On the actual data.

1633
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Uh, there are a lot of different.

1634
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Uh.

1635
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Different types, like your node.

1636
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
There are different types of nodes.

1637
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Like gender, male, female, race.

1638
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Black, white, Asian.

1639
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Like this is a note type.

1640
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That edge is also edge.

1641
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Then you can add different weight.

1642
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You can be 01.

1643
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You can also be a variety of numbers.

1644
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Or.

1645
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Uh, a few kinds of 0.51.

1646
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
0123.

1647
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Or you can be a sign.

1648
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Different edge.

1649
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Then your edge can also be directional.

1650
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You can point to different places.

1651
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That's what you're using now.

1652
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
This algorithm.

1653
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Have you ever thought that you can promote it in the future?

1654
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Different nodes or edge types.

1655
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I don't know if this is in the complex.

1656
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Will it be an extension?

1657
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
An important extension.

1658
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
This is the first question.

1659
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The second question is, um.

1660
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm curious.

1661
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
This algorithm.

1662
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's you give a sequence.

1663
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
With, uh.

1664
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Uh, another one.

1665
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I forgot the name, but you give two sequences.

1666
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You can push it all.

1667
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Uh, a possible picture.

1668
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Even the future method can be calculated.

1669
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That if I give you today.

1670
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Is a part of the information.

1671
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Assuming I take my class.

1672
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm going to do a comparison of the data.

1673
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I have a class.

1674
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
30 students.

1675
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Suppose only 10 students fill this information.

1676
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Then we assume that the information he filled is complete.

1677
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That I can use your method.

1678
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Calculate these 10 people.

1679
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Among the data given.

1680
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
This may be behind you.

1681
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Maybe you didn't handle this article.

1682
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But a question behind it.

1683
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Your opinion is.

1684
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Take the data of these 10 people to restore the whole 30 people.

1685
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The ensemble on the board.

1686
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Then the credibility of this.

1687
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Is it worth doing this?

1688
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't really know.

1689
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
This is the second one.

1690
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
If you only get part of the observation information.

1691
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Can you guess the whole group?

1692
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Interaction.

1693
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
What is the interaction of various high-level low-level?

1694
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The last question is.

1695
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You finally mentioned that.

1696
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Like persistent homology.

1697
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Indeed, in this field.

1698
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Development is very fast.

1699
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
When we do social studies.

1700
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There will also be different holes.

1701
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You just said those holes.

1702
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
We want to say that it is a high-level interaction.

1703
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
In social studies, there is a hole called structural hole.

1704
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Structural hole is to say.

1705
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Between two groups.

1706
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It may not be so close.

1707
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
There will be some key loopholes.

1708
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
The two are more.

1709
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
How to have a connected group.

1710
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Connected together.

1711
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I don't know if it's your observation.

1712
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Or your feeling.

1713
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
These two holes.

1714
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
One is from homology.

1715
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The hole of homology.

1716
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
With social science.

1717
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
On the graph.

1718
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Called structural hole.

1719
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Is it possible to have something to do with it?

1720
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Because you just said.

1721
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
The conclusion is not necessarily the conclusion of homology.

1722
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The denser the picture, the less.

1723
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I always want to say these two.

1724
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I actually didn't think it through.

1725
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
This is a very wonderful speech.

1726
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Thank you.

1727
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
That was my three-year question.

1728
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Thank you.

1729
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
First of all.

1730
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I want to say.

1731
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I think now.

1732
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Because these studies.

1733
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Are all based on data.

1734
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I want to have a data.

1735
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Then come and ask me.

1736
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
The data is quite small.

1737
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Then.

1738
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
There are more pictures.

1739
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So, in fact, there are some.

1740
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The study is how.

1741
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
From one.

1742
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Observe the data in the picture.

1743
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Go.

1744
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Do statistics.

1745
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
In fact.

1746
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
For example, three people.

1747
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
They are all connected to each other.

1748
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
In fact, we express it as.

1749
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Three sides.

1750
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Three sides.

1751
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
No than.

1752
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They are expressed as one.

1753
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
A hyper edge.

1754
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's still coming.

1755
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's effective in statistics.

1756
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So there's a lot of this.

1757
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
How from one.

1758
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Infer high order structure.

1759
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
The question.

1760
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
That.

1761
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So you just said.

1762
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You just said the question.

1763
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I want to refresh.

1764
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The second one is.

1765
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's related to.

1766
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
That is.

1767
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Can extend.

1768
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I just said this.

1769
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Configuration model work.

1770
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And then today.

1771
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
If I have a data.

1772
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
He.

1773
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
There may be nodes.

1774
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
For example, human network data nodes may have.

1775
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Racial and income and so on.

1776
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And then I'm going to fix it.

1777
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And then to generate an ensemble.

1778
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I do not know.

1779
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
But I will.

1780
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
All these questions I will go back.

1781
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Look at the graph.

1782
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I have no impression of the graph.

1783
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But I think.

1784
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It seems to be a very good starting point.

1785
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Because he.

1786
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Because he.

1787
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It can help us answer.

1788
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Other statistical issues.

1789
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
We can.

1790
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That offline.

1791
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You can talk about this.

1792
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That.

1793
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Then the second question is.

1794
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
With.

1795
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
In fact, the first two questions.

1796
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I do not know.

1797
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The second question is today.

1798
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Say I have one.

1799
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I have a class of 50 people.

1800
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Then, of course, from.

1801
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm talking about this algorithm.

1802
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I can put it.

1803
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Randomization.

1804
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Randomization.

1805
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Every one.

1806
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You can take it as a statistical value.

1807
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
To get a distribution.

1808
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
But if I can only observe.

1809
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Part of the people in these 50.

1810
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
How do I get from.

1811
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
This part of the inside.

1812
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Get the most information.

1813
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
In fact, I should have this distribution.

1814
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Get the most information.

1815
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I also think it is a very good research question.

1816
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I do not know.

1817
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And I think the two questions I just said.

1818
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
In.

1819
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
On the graph.

1820
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I do not seem to have seen such a job.

1821
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Just on the graph.

1822
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
That.

1823
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That.

1824
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
The third question.

1825
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It may be easier to answer.

1826
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Is.

1827
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So.

1828
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Uh, I sound like that.

1829
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's more like a set.

1830
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
A defined definition, right?

1831
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Uh, if that's the case.

1832
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Uh, because in.

1833
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Topology inside.

1834
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Topology.

1835
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
This thing.

1836
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Um, he is.

1837
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
There is a clear.

1838
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
One of the.

1839
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Um.

1840
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's technical.

1841
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm going to take this data.

1842
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Divided into different dimensions.

1843
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And then this dimension forms a circle complex.

1844
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And then the circle complex inside.

1845
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Different dimensions.

1846
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The so-called.

1847
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Boundary map link.

1848
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And then the boundary map is going to form some properties.

1849
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
For example.

1850
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It must be zero.

1851
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That's it.

1852
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Because of a mathematical property like this.

1853
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Uh, I can do it inside.

1854
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
To calculate the hole.

1855
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So, um.

1856
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So if it's a.

1857
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
If it's a social network.

1858
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And then I'm going to ask.

1859
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
The hole on it.

1860
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Um.

1861
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
What's the connection?

1862
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I, I, I think.

1863
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Um.

1864
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I don't think it's possible to answer this question just by looking at the structure.

1865
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Because of your structure.

1866
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The definition of the hole is already.

1867
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Contains some.

1868
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Tributes related to nodes.

1869
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
For example, who is.

1870
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
The most influential of the two groups.

1871
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But if it's.

1872
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Uh, topology.

1873
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's all about math.

1874
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You tell me.

1875
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
What's the structure like?

1876
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Triangles filled with triangles.

1877
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
There are a few filled with two sides.

1878
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So, and then calculate.

1879
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So.

1880
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
The topology.

1881
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The hole in the topology.

1882
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's all about the structure.

1883
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And then it might be with.

1884
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Um.

1885
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Related to sociology.

1886
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Structural hole is related.

1887
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It may not be related.

1888
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Thank you.

1889
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I hope I answered.

1890
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah, I might be offline.

1891
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Ask something that we are interested in.

1892
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Show you again.

1893
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Thank you.

1894
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Do you have any questions?

1895
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Can I ask a question myself?

1896
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Just.

1897
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You just proposed a heuristic.

1898
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
The algorithm.

1899
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Then.

1900
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In my opinion.

1901
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Because I'm not.

1902
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm not familiar with this at all.

1903
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
In my opinion.

1904
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Your algorithm looks like.

1905
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
If there is a solution.

1906
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
If this algorithm finds a solution.

1907
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Then you are successful.

1908
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But in the picture you just showed.

1909
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
It has those.

1910
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
How did you do that?

1911
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Just.

1912
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
My.

1913
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It looks like your algorithm.

1914
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I haven't finished all the calculations.

1915
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
How do you know there is no solution?

1916
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Um.

1917
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
This is a good question.

1918
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I skipped it because I was in a hurry.

1919
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Uh, because I know I can't.

1920
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I can't.

1921
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Explore all possibilities.

1922
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So I have set a cutoff.

1923
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Then.

1924
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
If the number of failures is greater than the cutoff.

1925
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I said there was no solution.

1926
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
But maybe I'll be more serious.

1927
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
There will be a solution.

1928
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
If I wait long enough, there will be a solution.

1929
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Yes, but on your picture.

1930
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The part that is not solved.

1931
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Isn't it white?

1932
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Isn't the white part?

1933
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Oh.

1934
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
The reason is because that picture.

1935
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Is a very small example.

1936
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So in that example.

1937
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Basically I have all.

1938
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
All explored.

1939
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
All explored.

1940
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
But my question is.

1941
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Your claim is.

1942
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
More than 80% of the.

1943
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The problem will be solved.

1944
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
But.

1945
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But in my opinion.

1946
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It seems that the white part is more than the other parts.

1947
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Isn't that just the case?

1948
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
My claim.

1949
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
My claim is.

1950
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
In this larger network.

1951
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Is 80%.

1952
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
OK.

1953
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But the example you just showed.

1954
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The network is too small.

1955
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Then the example I just showed.

1956
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
In fact, it may also be 80%.

1957
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But it's just looking up here.

1958
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Then.

1959
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
If there is a solution, it must be.

1960
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
If there is a solution, it must be.

1961
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Oh.

1962
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Um.

1963
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
This is the part I didn't talk about.

1964
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Um.

1965
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Because I.

1966
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
If this is too large.

1967
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I will have a lot of possibilities.

1968
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I need to find.

1969
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
So in this.

1970
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I chose a number.

1971
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Then I randomly.

1972
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
In all possibilities.

1973
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
After choosing this number.

1974
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Then this.

1975
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I figured out the number.

1976
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
The ratio.

1977
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Then just.

1978
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
The one I just said.

1979
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The example that adds up to 13.

1980
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It's probably from here.

1981
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So in other words.

1982
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You would expect to say.

1983
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Um.

1984
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You would expect to say probably.

1985
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Is less than.

1986
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
0.01.

1987
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
After you choose a size.

1988
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Then you will feel all the possibilities.

1989
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
That's the one.

1990
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Add up to that size.

1991
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
In those possibilities.

1992
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It's probably 0.01.

1993
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Find a simplicial.

1994
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
OK.

1995
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Then we.

1996
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
We say he is.

1997
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
The method.

1998
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
There are two.

1999
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
One is that he has some obvious reasons.

2000
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I was rejected.

2001
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think he won't have a simplicial possibility.

2002
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
For example.

2003
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
For example.

2004
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
My.

2005
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
For example.

2006
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's all 3 here.

2007
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Add up to 15.

2008
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But I only have 15 here.

2009
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Or for example.

2010
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Add up to 15.

2011
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
For example, here is 7.

2012
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Then here is 8.

2013
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Here is 8.

2014
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Then here is 7.

2015
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
But this is 8.

2016
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Then I was rejected.

2017
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is non-simplicial.

2018
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
There are many parts.

2019
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's a very simple reason.

2020
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Then.

2021
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
There are quite a lot of parts.

2022
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I set the cutoff.

2023
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I gave up over time.

2024
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Another question is.

2025
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
My other question is.

2026
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You later.

2027
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Said your.

2028
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Turistic algorithm.

2029
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
He.

2030
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Usually find less holes.

2031
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Structure.

2032
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Will this cause.

2033
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
After that.

2034
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Randomize.

2035
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Are you biased towards a certain structure?

2036
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You may not be completely.

2037
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Randomize your picture.

2038
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I think this is also a very good question.

2039
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Then.

2040
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
They.

2041
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
They did.

2042
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
This randomization.

2043
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
When this work.

2044
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's already in his paper.

2045
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Explain that he thinks.

2046
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
They do this.

2047
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Randomization.

2048
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Explore this space.

2049
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's all connected.

2050
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So you can find it all.

2051
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
That.

2052
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So this should not be a problem.

2053
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Then I do it myself.

2054
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
The test did not feel.

2055
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I think.

2056
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I can't find a data.

2057
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Then from different starting points.

2058
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Then see if he is.

2059
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Different space.

2060
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It feels like it's all converged.

2061
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So this is a reasonable question.

2062
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Then we.

2063
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I have no evidence to say.

2064
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It will be different.

2065
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So I think.

2066
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It's good to find one.

2067
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
The meaning of the so-called ergotic.

2068
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Say.

2069
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
All possible.

2070
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
All possible.

2071
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Those structures.

2072
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
In.

2073
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
After some kind of transformation.

2074
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It will become another.

2075
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The same thing.

2076
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Then.

2077
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But it can make a whole circle.

2078
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
All possible structures.

2079
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Are interconnected.

2080
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
The way to connect is in that kind of swap.

2081
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
This thing.

2082
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Will not let all possible.

2083
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
This instance.

2084
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Split in half.

2085
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
OK.

2086
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So use his method.

2087
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
All.

2088
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
All possible structures will be connected.

2089
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So you run slowly.

2090
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
You will run across the entire network.

2091
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Correct.

2092
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But there are many problems here.

2093
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
That is.

2094
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It may take a long time to run slowly.

2095
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Correct.

2096
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Just like the ergotic of physics.

2097
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But.

2098
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
This job is to provide a starting point.

2099
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Let people start from there.

2100
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Thank you.

2101
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Are there any questions here?

2102
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
OK.

2103
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
If not.

2104
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Thank you.

2105
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
The recording is turned off.

2106
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
OK.
