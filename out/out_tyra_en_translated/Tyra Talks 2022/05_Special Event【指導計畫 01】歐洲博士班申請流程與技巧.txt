Oh, maybe I can think about it first. I probably won't provide slides because I know a lot of participants will want slides, but I won't provide slides.
Anyway, there are recordings, so I think it should be fine.
Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.
Taira is a friendly environment for young researchers in Taiwan.
We hold Taira Talk every weekend.
The format and content of this talk are very diverse.
Academic researchers can share their research results here according to their occupations,
and also practice live presentations or meet future potential partners.
Today is the first lecture of the Taira 2022 Overseas Researcher Application Guidelines.
The topic is European Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.
Next week will be the North American Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.
Next week, August 28th, will be two types of application documents, CV and SOP writing skills.
We mentioned in the propaganda file and application form that if you are willing to participate in one-on-one Ph.D. application mentoring,
if you sign up and attend the first or second lecture, plus the third CV and SOP writing lecture,
you will have the opportunity to mentor first.
Let me briefly explain this one-on-one guidance.
This year, we have invited many young scholars with overseas study experience to serve as mentors
to help Taiwanese students prepare for various applications,
such as school consultations, interview preparation, etc.
The mentors selected can apply for mentors according to their own conditions, such as the field of research, the target school, etc.
Then the mentors can choose mentors that are suitable for help according to their personal wishes.
We expect to recruit about 100 mentors this year,
because the registration situation in the past was quite intense,
so if the number of applicants exceeds,
if you participate in this series of lectures in August, you will have the opportunity to mentor first.
So we highly encourage everyone to participate in the third CV and SOP lecture.
At the same time, we also hope that everyone can listen to our other TerraTalks in the future.
We have continued to update the lecture list on our official website.
You are also welcome to follow our Facebook and Instagram.
You can also join the Terra membership for free and enjoy more membership exclusive rights.
You can have more interactions with other mentors.
I will post the registration form for joining the membership in the chat later.
Today's event will issue a Terra badge as a certificate of participation.
This is an NFT, which is a completely open and unalterable record.
For more information, please see the chat link.
To join the certificate, you must first install the PoAP app.
You can first scan the QR code in the chat link to install the PoAP app.
We will announce the password to receive the badge after the lecture.
If your phone cannot install the app, please stay after the lecture.
We will help you solve it.
Later, we will invite two speakers to share their thoughts.
After the lecture, we will have a Q&A session.
Finally, we will issue the NFT.
Today, we welcome the first speaker.
He is Dr. Zhang Zhaoyuan from the University of Dresden.
His field of research is business engineering.
According to Terra's tradition, we will turn on the microphone.
I will end my slideshare.
I will turn on the microphone again.
Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his thoughts.
Thank you for the invitation, Project Terra.
I will share my experience applying for a university in Europe.
I am Zhang Zhaoyuan.
As the host said, I am currently studying my Ph.D. at Dresden.
Before coming to Germany, I studied at Cornell University.
I studied Biomedical Engineering for one year.
I will not talk about the U.S. part of today's talk.
I don't know if you are still hesitating to apply for a university in the U.S. or Europe.
I will leave this part for Q&A.
I have a few slides to share about the difference between the European system and the U.S. system.
As I said, I don't know what your current status is.
If you are still a blank sheet, and don't know how to start your Ph.D.,
I think the most important thing is to ask yourself what your motivation is.
It may sound vague.
I won't teach you how to write a document today.
But your motivation will affect how you write your documents.
Even if you are lucky enough to get an interview offer, you will be asked.
If your motivation is not strong enough,
the interviewer or the person reviewing your document will be able to tell.
In this case, you may be less competitive than other candidates.
So you have to ask yourself why you want to apply for a Ph.D.
Why do you want to study for a master's degree? Why do you want to study for a Ph.D.?
Why do you want to study abroad?
These are all important.
Otherwise, you can stay in Taiwan.
In the field of engineering, you can do very well in Taiwan.
In Taiwan, the Peninsula Institute is very famous.
You can finish a master's degree or Ph.D.
Then you can go to the Peninsula Institute.
You can make a lot of money.
So why do you want to study abroad?
After studying abroad, what are the requirements?
These are the things you have to do.
So at this stage, if you haven't prepared anything,
the time you need the most is to do some research.
Which school should I study?
Which university should I study?
Do I have the opportunity to apply for a Ph.D.?
These are the things we can discuss later.
I applied for a Ph.D. in Germany.
I only applied for a Ph.D.
But in principle, it can be applied to most European and EU countries.
In the traditional European system,
it's a bit like looking for a job.
Our Chinese is called teacher-student system.
If you see a professor who has a Ph.D. position,
you can write a letter to tell him,
I saw you applied for a Ph.D. position.
What's my background?
I'm interested in this topic.
He may ask you to add your resume, motivation, etc.
If he thinks it's OK, he'll say,
OK, let's have an interview.
After the conversation, he might say,
OK, I think you're good. I want to hire you.
Tell me when you're coming.
That's it.
You and the boss are set.
Another one is the structured Ph.D. program.
You may be familiar with it.
It's adapted from English-speaking countries,
such as the US, the UK, Australia, or even Taiwan.
It's a Ph.D. program.
You have to apply to a certain department or Ph.D. program.
It usually has a lot of requirements.
Because it's a program,
it may require you to do lab rotation during your Ph.D.
You have to take classes, etc.
You have to meet certain requirements to be able to defend yourself.
But for a teacher-student system,
you have to go into the lab to do research.
It doesn't require you to take classes, etc.
to graduate.
This is the biggest difference
between a teacher-student system
and a structured program.
Most structured programs,
I'll talk about it later,
besides universities and so-called research institutes,
when it provides a structured program,
it's not unlimited.
Unlike in Taiwan,
when you graduate, you have to wait for your teacher's approval.
It's the same for a teacher-student system.
But in general,
for a structured program,
it usually gives you a 2-3 year contract,
up to 1 year.
So for most structured programs,
the average Ph.D. year is around 4 years.
So how do I start looking for my Ph.D. position?
I didn't put a website here.
You can just type in the title,
like Nature Career, Uroxas,
or just type in your Ph.D.
It's just a website.
Then you can search for your Ph.D. position.
There are a few filter conditions.
It depends on how you want to filter.
Some of these are from the EU.
You might want to go to Germany,
or the UK, etc.
You can filter by yourself.
Nature Career,
in terms of reading a Ph.D. in the EU,
they see it as a job.
So from Nature Career,
you can also see a lot of
European Ph.D. positions.
Uroxas,
is from the EU.
It has a special
fellowship.
I'll talk about it later.
And then there are
some other platforms,
like Ph.D. Scholarly B.
Of course,
if you know
which universities you want to go to,
you can go to
one of the universities
and find a teacher.
If you're interested,
you can write a letter
asking if you're interested
in your research,
and if you want to
get a Ph.D.
It'll tell you
if you're in the right position.
Or if you want to
apply for a program
in my lab,
it'll tell you if you're
in the right network.
Social media,
like Facebook,
Instagram,
Twitter,
a lot of professors
have their own Twitter
or lab Twitter.
If you have a Ph.D.
or post-doc position,
you can post
from there.
I prefer
more and more people
are using LinkedIn.
It's a network opportunity.
If you have a professor
and he posts his position,
you can set a job alert.
You can set a keyword
like Ph.D. Student,
Ph.D. Scholar,
or Ph.D. Researcher.
Your country can be
Europe or Germany.
It'll tell you
which Ph.D. positions
you can apply for.
Let's talk about
what's special
about studying Ph.D.
in Europe.
We usually
focus on
universities.
But in Europe,
universities are more
about teaching.
But in Europe,
there are a lot of
institutes.
A lot of
big international companies
also have Ph.D. positions.
I mentioned
some special
fellowships in EU.
We'll talk about it later.
I can't talk about
all the institutes
in EU.
I'll talk about
the four most famous
institutes in Germany.
There are also
research opportunities
in some institutes.
I'll talk about
Max Planck,
Helmholtz,
Fraunhofer,
and Leibniz.
Different colors
represent different
societies or associations.
There are so many
research opportunities
in Germany.

She wants me to leave first
and then join again.
I'll try.
I'll try.
When I was at the Academy,
if you can see
in the chat,
I posted about
joining TARA
and our
Facebook fan page.
The latest
news is
our Linktree.
There are a lot of
information about TARA.
Can you see it now?
Can you see it now?
Yes, I can.
Can you see
my presentation slides?
Yes, I can.
Yes, I can.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today,
I'll talk about
European Economics.
I applied for
European Economics.
Compared to
the previous speaker,
I think
European Economics
should be
a bit different
from the
lab environment.
lab environment.
So,
I'll start
by introducing myself.
I'll start with my background
so that you can understand
what kind of
perspective I have
when it comes to
European Economics.
I'll talk about
my preparation
for European Economics.
Then,
I'll talk about
how to choose a school
and my research topic.
I'll also talk about
my budget
and my salary
in Europe.
Finally,
I'll talk about
my academic background.
I studied in Taiwan
from 2014 to 2018,
but my master's degree
was in Europe.
From 2018 to 2019,
I studied for one year,
and from 2019 to 2020,
I studied for two years.
From 2021,
I went to my doctorate
and started writing my thesis.
My research topic
is economic development
and armed conflicts
in the United Nations.
I'll talk about my preparation
for my doctorate.
You may be curious
about how much you need
to study to get
a doctorate
in the field of
social science.
I used to ask
some teachers
in Taiwan University
if I didn't get
a doctorate
in high-level economics
or high-level statistics.
In fact,
it's not so certain.
It depends on your goal.
If you want to
study pure theoretical
economic theory,
high-level economics
or high-level statistics
are really necessary.
However,
as long as you can
get a doctorate,
you won't have
too many problems.
If you want to
study economics,
you need to know
whether you like
individual,
general,
or economic economics.
You also need to know
whether you need
a master's degree
in Taiwan,
because
in the U.S.,
there are not so many choices
for a master's degree.
In the U.S.,
a lot of master's degrees
are held
not for
a master's degree,
but for
a master's degree.
In the U.S.,
a master's degree
is given to you
as a scholarship.
In Chicago,
there are some good
scholarships,
but the tuition
is very expensive.
In contrast,
I chose to study
a master's degree in Europe
because the tuition
is relatively cheap.
When I studied
a master's degree in the Netherlands,
the tuition was 2000 euros per year.
In the U.S.,
a master's degree
can expand
your academic network
and allow you
to adapt to
the environment
of studying abroad.
After two years,
you can decide
whether you want
to apply for a doctor's degree
in Europe or
in the U.S.
In my opinion,
even if you decide
to apply for a doctor's degree
in Taiwan,
a lot of people
apply for a doctor's degree
in Taiwan
after two years
of studying
a master's degree.
Some people
apply for a doctor's degree
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Taiwan.
Some countries
allow you
to start writing
your thesis
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Taiwan.
In my opinion,
you can start
writing your thesis
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Taiwan
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Taiwan
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Europe.
In the past
three or four years,
many people
apply for a doctor's degree
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Europe
after two years
of studying
a doctor's degree
in Taiwan
after two years
of studying

So if you want to apply for a top-30 school in the U.S., there are many schools in Europe that can be compared.
I think the topic is very different from science and engineering, because we usually write a paper with only one person's name,
instead of having a lot of co-authors or a whole lab to complete a project.
I think the topic is very important for social science students, because sometimes you have to write a research plan yourself,
and you have to go all the way from the literature review to the research method, and even if you want to do practical evidence, you have to have information, or you have to do interviews, and so on.
All of these have to be written in great detail, but before you apply for a doctoral program, do you have such a detailed research plan?
In fact, it has a lot to do with the type of doctoral program you choose.
As I mentioned before, American doctoral programs usually start with a training course, and they say that if you have passed the training course in the first two years, you will start writing your own thesis in the third year.
If you want to apply for a U.S. doctoral program, they basically do not require a research plan during the application process.
In Europe, it is divided into a similar model in the United States, or you can start writing your thesis directly.
In Europe, the deadline for writing a thesis is usually three to four years, unlike the United States, where you can write it for four or five years.
So, I think this is quite important. If you come to Europe today and decide to start studying for a doctoral program, I think you should be very clear about your research topic, what kind of topic you have, and whether you can complete this doctoral thesis in the next three to four years.
So, if you start writing your thesis directly when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program, you usually have to go through the research plan when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program.
As I mentioned earlier, in Germany and the Netherlands, you are a school employee, and your job title is a PhD researcher.
In Belgium, most of my salary is in contact with HR, but I am not a full-time school employee. What I get is not a job contract, but a scholarship letter.
So, some benefits are not the same. For example, I don't have a pension, but if you are in the Netherlands, the school will give you a pension, which is like a pension. It should be considered a pension, but I only have social security insurance.
So, the benefits are not the same, but my benefit is that I don't get paid for my work, so I don't have to be taxed for my salary. But in the Netherlands, your salary will be deducted first.
In terms of economics, the monthly income is about 1,700 to 2,000 euros. If you start writing your thesis first, you will get a scholarship letter, which is about 500 euros per month, and some people get 1,200 euros.
In other words, even if you are in the master's program, as long as you save enough money, you don't have to spend too much money on your master's program.
In the Netherlands and Germany, there are more of these methods. In the first two years of your master's program, you have a chance to get a scholarship.
I think it's important to figure out your source of income, because if you study abroad and spend your youth, you may be 30 years old after studying for 34 years. You don't want to be in debt after studying.
So if you find that your source of income is a master's program, which is more like a master's program, and every August you have to ask the professor and the HR of the school to confirm that the student's budget can be extended for another year.
So my scholarship letter is not given once every four years, but it is renewed every year. At first, I was afraid that the teacher would be displeased with me, or I would be lazy, so I decided not to renew it.
I think this is a tricky point for a master's program. You really have to make sure that the teacher's personality is normal and he is a good person. Otherwise, I have heard that the teacher is unhappy and the master's program can only be terminated for half a year.
My personal experience is that I used to study in the Netherlands and Belgium, and my boyfriend is now studying economics in Germany, and I also applied to a German school.
I have been talking about Europe and other countries, and now I want to talk about these three countries more clearly.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a one-year or two-year master's program. In Spain, I studied for one year, but why did I study for another two years in the Netherlands?
Usually, a one-year master's program is not considered to be a program that allows you to write a thesis. It stipulates that you need to have 120 ECTS. You don't have to worry about the points. If you study for two years in Taiwan, you will definitely be able to write a thesis in Europe.
However, if you study for one year in Europe, most students will want to study for another two years. In the Netherlands, the two-year master's program is generally referred to as a research master's program.
In fact, it is a bit like the UK, where there is a difference between MSc and MPhil. In Germany, the two-year master's program is basically two years. So whether you are studying for MSc or MSc, it is still a two-year course. The first year is a basic course, and the second year you start writing a thesis.
In terms of language, many people will think that I am studying in Europe today. Usually, I am not sure what the literature field is, but at least in economics, all programs and school requirements are based on English.
If you are in the Netherlands, you don't have to worry too much about whether you want to learn Dutch. If you live in the French-speaking area of ​​Belgium or in Germany, I think learning a little language is a good thing, and it is also a leisure other than studying for a master's program. Otherwise, English is basically enough.
Usually, the language requirements related to social science are relatively high, such as TOEFL and IELTS. However, TOEFL requires at least 100 points, and IELTS requires at least 7 points or more.
In terms of immigration, I think the reason why you want to go to a certain country to study is not only because of the school, but also because you want to plan your entire career. If I graduate, can I stay here to work or even apply for permanent residence?
I think there is a big point to consider, and that is whether you can get a work contract. I have been in Europe since 2018, but my years are in different countries, so I can't transfer to permanent residence.
For example, I have been studying in Belgium for 4 years, and I have been in Europe for 7 years, so I can't apply for permanent residence, because I am taking a student's scholarship, not a job. However, in the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.
In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved. In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.
In terms of employment opportunities, I think there are more job opportunities in Europe than in Taiwan, because in economics, in the EU, you can often find companies like competition economics or competition consulting, but there are fewer such industries in Taiwan, and most people are still in the financial industry.
For example, some people like social impact, or some areas that are considered not profitable in Taiwan, but I think there are many opportunities in Europe, and this is why I want to come to Europe to study, and even stay here to work in the future.
My application experience goes back to the basics, which is how to apply for a doctorate. The offer I got at that time was one in Germany, one in Belgium, and one in the Netherlands.
In Germany, it is a 5-year doctorate class, which is a 2-year class plus a 3-year thesis. In the Netherlands, it is also 2 years plus 4 years or 2 years plus 3 years.
So, if you want to write a letter to the professor, in fact, like in Germany, there was no need to write a letter to the professor in the second half of the Netherlands and the second half of the Netherlands, but in Luwen, where I am now, because it is a master-apprentice relationship, the teacher opened a circle on his website or the school's website and said that I now have a research plan, and I can hire a doctorate student for this plan.
If you are interested in this position, you can write a letter to me with your CV and motivation, and then the teacher will look at the information you sent him and see if he is interested in you.
So, like this, if you see a job position, you usually start writing your thesis directly. This is the case in both Belgium and Germany, and it is relatively rare in the Netherlands, but it is also the case.
So, in fact, it's back to Europe, because in the beginning of Europe, they are all master-apprentices, but it's just because economics is more similar to the US training method. It allows you to take two more years of classes before you write your thesis to ensure that the training you receive is of a certain level.
As I said earlier, the entrance requirements of the doctoral class are to find a way to do your own related courses in college, and then if you write your thesis in Taiwan and teach in Taiwan, then basically your own thesis should be able to be presented in English to your future doctoral class.
The motivation and research plan really depend on what field you want to study. For example, I said at the beginning that I wanted to study economic development because I was also doing economic development in the past, and I was also very interested in this part.
In terms of recommendations, I think it is a very important reason for deciding whether you will go to a certain school, at least in economics.
Because when I was in Manhattan, my recommendation was a professor when I was studying in Barcelona, and it just so happens that the professor of the Manhattan Graduate Committee was staying in Barcelona before, so he knew those two professors.
I think that in the academic world, your skill sets are usually so-called soft skills, which means that you may be very good at writing, you may have a lot of ideas, or you may have a lot of research ideas, but these things are not so easy to quantify.
Because we usually publish a lot of papers when we are not in the undergraduate master's program. These hard-to-quantify skills are actually based on your recommendation and your recommender to help you present.
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.
This is because I just wanted to add that, in fact, what is the standard of living in Europe with 1200 euros of master's scholarships or 2000 euros of doctoral scholarships? I think it is absolutely enough.
The advantage of living in Europe is that I don't know how to drive, but I think a lot of students who study in the U.S. will not be able to go anywhere if they don't know how to drive.
But I didn't have time to learn how to drive when I was in Taiwan, so I had to come out and study. But I think in Europe, you don't have to be afraid of driving.
The advantage of living in Europe is that you can buy cheap tickets for Christmas and summer vacation and travel around. So, you don't necessarily have to go to the U.S. to come to Europe. You will also have a good life and a happy doctoral program.
When studying for a doctoral program, I think it is much more important to find a good teacher and the right topic than the school rankings in Europe.
Because every school in Europe has its own specialties, if you only look at the rankings, you may miss out on the fact that there is a teacher here who has published a lot of good papers, and it happens to be your field.
Then, you need to develop your daily routine and habits. For example, my contract is that I don't even need to teach any books. I don't need to be a TA.
Sometimes I feel like I'm so free today, and I don't know what to do. But in fact, this flexibility is a good thing, but sometimes it makes you too lazy.
In Europe, in addition to reading books, learning languages ​​is also a good hobby.
I'm done talking. I think it's about time. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing. We expect to open Q&A until about 10.50, and then we will start issuing digital participation certificates.
Because there are quite a few people today, so if you want to directly open the microphone to ask questions, please raise your hand first.
Or you can also type the question in the chat and I will pay attention to it.
If you are still thinking about what questions to ask, when you are preparing for that question, I think you can ask Zhao Yuan to share again.
What is the difference between the United States and Europe when it comes to the field of science and technology?
Let me share my screen again.
I forgot to mention that if I talked too fast or if you have any personal questions that are not convenient to ask, you can contact me.
My email is haiyongjiancornell. You can also scan the QR code and you can link with me.
Because the last speaker talked a little bit about stipends and contracts, I will talk about Germany first and then enter the United States.
For example, because the speaker has already talked about it, I will talk faster.
It really depends on the boss. I think if you can get a contract, please get a contract.
You will get a visa, a work visa, not a student visa.
The work visa means that you are the same as most employees.
In principle, in Germany, it is a 20-30-day vacation.
For our medical school, it is a 30-day vacation.
Your salary includes tax, pension and medical insurance.
Please remember that German medical insurance is very expensive.
So if you want to pay for it yourself, you will have to pay a lot of money from your own pocket.
And if you are already paying taxes, you have been paying for four years and you have just graduated.
Then I found out that you are looking for a job, whether it is a postdoc or a medical job, and then the school is over.
Because you have paid taxes before, and then there is a bit of unemployment in the middle.
In fact, you will be paid a unemployment pension because you have no money.
And a lot of social benefits.
In Germany, we are not the so-called tuition fee, we are usually the semester fee.
Then each class will have different rules, and then for our school, it is 290 euros.
So if you don't have an economic assessment, I think Germany is a good choice.
Then we come to the difference between the United States and Germany.
In the United States, it is a program system for each school program.
It has a fixed application deadline every year.
Suddenly it's winter, and then fall next year.
Then, in Germany, I just said that there are two systems.
There is no certain teacher-student system.
Then, if the program system, of course, there is an application deadline.
However, each program has a different deadline.
For example, Envelope and MPI know that they try not to squeeze together.
So they will miss each other.
Then in every institute of MPI, their Ph.D. program will not be unified.
You just saw that every institute is listed in various cities.
So this is what you have to check on the Internet.
And the application requirement is that you may need something.
As I mentioned earlier, in the United States, you don't have to have a master's degree.
But in Europe, most of them need a master's degree.
In English exam, there is no so-called GRE in Germany.
It is mainly TOEFL and EAS.
Even if the time is more than two years, most of them can be accepted.
In the United States, there is one more GRE.
Of course, I know that in recent years, many schools, and the better schools, have actually removed the GRE.
Because they think, or GMAT, if the social science is GMAT, they will think that this is not necessarily related to research.
The resume is a must.
Here, CV is not a resume.
The meaning of CV is that the academic resume is all of it.
Most of it has no page speed limit.
You can write it on anything related to academics.
In the application document, this will be a little different.
Because the United States is still used to SOP, Statement of Purpose.
It is more important to see how your past experience will affect your next PhD, next career, next step.
However, if it is in Germany, it is more like so-called lateral motivation.
Because you have to think about one thing.
Because the PhD in Germany is relatively short.
It is three to four years.
In addition, you already have a master's degree.
So you are very clear.
Including just now, it should be considered that you already know what your research direction goal is.
So you should talk about your past academic and where your goal is.
Because I had a background in the past, so I had to find this lab to do this kind of research.
But in the United States, you still have the so-called first-year course and lab rotation.
So it cares more about your potential.
What did you experience in the past?
What will your future development be?
But you don't have to think too much now.
Because in principle, when you are applying for a document, a certain program will tell you.
He hopes that this document will contain something.
Recommendation letter, then the United States must be three points can not run away.
In Germany, it is two to three points, not necessarily.
Then there must be a score sheet.
It's just that when you apply, you have to submit it or be accepted.
Then there is a very interesting one in Germany.
Because of the education system itself, they also want to provide a high school score sheet.
So it's a bit of a hassle.
But in order to submit a high school score sheet in English, it took me a little time.
Then the United States has almost no paper test.
Then in Germany, there are several.
For example, Heidelberg needs to be interviewed.
Then the Ph.D. system, as I just mentioned, has the so-called teacher-student structure system.
I just talked about the cost.
The cost is really a lot worse.
Because in the United States, there are some more conservative schools that may be free.
For example, the German system is mostly free.
Up to $100.
But in principle, all the application fees here in Germany are free.
And you don't have to send your results from ETS.
This money may be several years ago.
It may be higher now, I don't know.
But you don't have to send this ETS score sheet in addition.
But it's possible that he'll do it for you.
He cares a lot about whether your transcript has been recognized.
He usually tells you that there will be a uni-assistant in Germany.
And then he will ask you to sign up.
It seems that there are some schools in the United States.
But I didn't meet at all when I applied.
And then, do you need to submit a paper document?
I think it depends on the program.
And then I mentioned the stipend and salary part.
Germany has stipend and contract.
In the United States, we actually quite agree.
Because you have to pay your own taxes later.
Like we're in the US right now.
In the United States, you get that money.
You have to pay your own taxes every year.
But usually the school will give you your tuition.
And then you have to pay your own taxes.
And then it's actually called health insurance.
Health insurance has to pay for itself.
I think another great place is Europe.
After you were invited, all your expenses.
I think it's a good thing.
After you were invited, all your expenses.
It turns out that my program was one week.
And then I was still studying in the United States.
When I flew from New York to here, all my expenses.
Tickets and so on were covered.
I know that this is getting less and less in the United States.
Because they want to save a little more money.
And now Skype interview is very convenient.
But the European system is still quite a lot.
The program will still retain this.
I think this is quite important.
And then during your Ph.D.
What will happen to you?
In Germany, if you are a 15-year-old, you don't have to go to class at all.
The program may be required to take a little class.
That kind of class is not the so-called combined course.
It may be some scientific practice or something like that.
There are some theoretical courses or something like that.
But in the United States, it's his first year, second year.
It's like your master, you still have to repair how many credits.
In the United States, a lot of times you still have to do lab rotation.
So you may be in the second year before you decide your lab.
But in Germany, in principle,
You have to decide your boss when you interview.
And then are you qualified to take the exam?
A lot of people in the United States are still qualified to take the exam.
But in Germany, you don't.
You are the professor who has been with people for three or four years.
And then a lot of programs in the United States require you to be a TA.
If you don't want to be a TA,
If you don't want to be a TA or just want to focus on research,
Germany will be more suitable for this.
The term of leave is quite different.
Because like I said, you need a master's degree to apply for a PhD in Germany.
In general, his term of leave is relatively short.
And if you miss the lab rotation, course, etc.
Of course, you can focus on research and graduate earlier.
But in the United States, it will be a little longer.
Flexibility of the project
Because I know a lot of American words, he's actually the boss.
I may not be discussing with him.
But if you think about it, the so-called master's degree in Germany means
Or it's like a job.
It's because of the grant project.
He may want you to do that thing.
So your flexibility may be limited.
Work-life balance, Europe must be the best.
It's just that you have so many annual leave.
In the United States, there may not be.
And because the United States is longer.
And then Germany is relatively short.
So there's a higher chance that you may not have one when you graduate.
This may also be something you have to think about.
The main comparison is probably here.
And then maybe you can stop here.
And then if you have any questions, you can ask the two of us.
