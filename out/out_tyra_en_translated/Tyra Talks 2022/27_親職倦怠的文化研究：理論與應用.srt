1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Recording has started.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,720
Okay, thank you for the introduction, Ya-Hui.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,600
And thank you all for coming to listen to my PhD thesis

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,000
or my research,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,440
my research over the past few years.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,840
Yes, I'm Gao Xian, Lin Gao Xian.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,160
And I'm currently at the University of Belize

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,520
taking my PhD class.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,840
And the topic I'm going to share with you today

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,200
is Occult Research in Parental Burnout,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,880
Theory and Application.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,560
It's a cultural research on parental burnout.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,240
Okay, when I give a speech on this topic,

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,360
I usually ask my audience,

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,400
we can imagine,

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,520
or some of us may already have some youthful experience.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,680
What do you think it would feel like to be a parent?

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
We'll probably spend some time,

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
probably a few seconds,

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,680
or even a minute,

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,640
to think about,

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
if you were a parent,

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,520
what kind of feeling would you usually feel?

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
Most of the audience,

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,720
or most parents,

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
would probably feel,

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,200
like it's shown in this picture,

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
we would feel that

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,760
parenthood is a place full of happiness,

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
full of excitement,

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,000
full of satisfaction.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
When we see our kids, we think they're so cute.

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,720
We think they're very innocent,

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,560
very innocent.

35
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,960
But in the past few years,

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,320
when we were in our IQ test,

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
when we were actually interacting with our parents,

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
we started to realize that

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,240
some parents don't feel

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,880
that they have this kind of positive feeling.

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,920
Some parents would tell us that

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,720
they felt

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
they were filled with a strong sense of bondage,

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,360
as if they were crushed

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,440
by the role of being a parent.

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
They even told us that

47
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,360
they felt they couldn't do anything for their kids.

48
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
They could only do what they had to do.

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,160
They couldn't do anything else.

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,800
Some parents even felt

51
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,520
that they couldn't bear

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,480
the role of being a parent anymore.

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,800
Some parents even told us that

54
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,840
they felt they were no longer

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
the good parents they used to be.

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,600
In fact, this kind of testimony

57
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,560
or this kind of report

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,440
is too diverse.

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,800
We hear too often

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,880
that our parents report this kind of experience.

61
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,160
As researchers,

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
we really want to understand

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
why they have this kind of feeling.

64
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,600
So we started to try to define

65
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
what kind of phenomenon this is.

66
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
So, over the past few years,

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,520
our team has defined a new feeling

68
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
or a new symptom.

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
We call it a parental burnout

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
or a new concept of parental burnout.

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
This concept includes

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
the various symptoms

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
we just talked about,

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,560
including the feeling of

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,280
being in a parental role

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
or a sense of distance

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
between you and your kids.

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
It's an emotional distancing.

79
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,200
So, you can only do

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,240
what you have to do for them

81
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,560
and you can't do anything

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,360
for them emotionally.

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
You may even feel

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,240
that you are burdened

85
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,040
with the sense of responsibility

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
of being a parent.

87
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Or you may even feel

88
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
that you have a different feeling

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
from the past.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,160
It's a contrasting experience.

91
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
We know that

92
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
if there is a parental burnout,

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
if parental burnout

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
really exists

95
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,880
as our researchers say,

96
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
we may be curious

97
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,280
about the importance

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
of parental burnout.

99
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
Why do we need to care about it?

100
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,680
I can tell you

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,760
that in our past research,

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,960
we found that

103
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
parental burnout

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,080
has a serious impact

105
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
on our parents

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
and our kids.

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
It affects their mental and physical health.

108
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
For example,

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,800
we found that

110
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
parental burnout

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
strongly affects our parents.

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
Especially the parents

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
with parental burnout.

114
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,560
They are more likely

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,800
to want to escape

116
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
their current life

117
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,520
and their family life.

118
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,960
This kind of ideation

119
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,720
has a strong effect

120
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,960
on their suicide.

121
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
It's a very important

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,080
cause of mental and physical health.

123
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
On the other hand,

124
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,680
we often see that

125
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,120
parents with parental burnout

126
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,840
tend to be violent

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,200
to their kids

128
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
or ignore the needs

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,320
of their kids

130
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,800
and misbehave.

131
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,760
It's not surprising

132
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,080
that if our parents

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,880
have parental burnout,

134
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,360
their kids often have

135
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,400
depression

136
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
or anxiety

137
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,400
in their mental and physical health.

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,880
This is a very important issue.

139
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,360
As we mentioned,

140
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
it may affect

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
our parents

142
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,160
or our next generation's

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
mental and physical health.

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
On the other hand,

145
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
we wonder

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
who

147
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
has parental burnout

148
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,440
or this kind of feeling.

149
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,800
In our past research,

150
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,600
we collected

151
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
the data of parents in different countries.

152
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
We tried to estimate

153
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
which country

154
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,960
or which country's parents

155
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
are more likely

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,640
to have parental burnout.

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,600
We found something

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,520
very important.

159
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,560
We found that

160
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
in different parts of the world,

161
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,200
the prevalence rate

162
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,680
of parental burnout

163
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,800
is very different.

164
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Especially in Western countries,

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,240
their parental burnout

166
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,760
is more likely

167
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,520
to happen

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
in Western countries.

169
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,280
Or they may have

170
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,200
parental burnout.

171
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
To be more specific,

172
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,520
this ratio

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,560
is even more than five times.

174
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,000
For example,

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
the picture on the left

176
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,520
is the prevalence rate

177
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,360
of parental burnout

178
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
we have estimated.

179
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
I don't know if you can see

180
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
my mouse.

181
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Basically,

182
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
in this picture,

183
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
the darker the color,

184
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,480
it means

185
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,560
the more likely

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
the parental burnout is.

187
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,760
We can see that

188
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,240
in North America

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
or in European countries,

190
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
even in Russia,

191
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
the prevalence rate

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
of parental burnout is the highest.

193
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
Compared to non-Western countries,

194
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,880
the prevalence rate

195
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,960
of parental burnout

196
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,640
is basically lower.

197
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,960
In fact, the highest

198
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,880
may even be up to 8%.

199
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,480
Parents may be

200
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,200
suffering

201
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,280
from parental burnout

202
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,640
or mental illness.

203
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
Next,

204
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,400
we may want to

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,680
ask

206
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
why

207
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,720
parents in Western countries

208
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,680
or their parents

209
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
may suffer from parental burnout

210
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,280
so easily.

211
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,320
Are there any shared reasons

212
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,840
in these regions

213
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
that can help us understand

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,640
why they may suffer

215
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
from parental burnout?

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,920
To answer this question,

217
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,360
we conducted

218
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,240
a series of research.

219
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
We did a cultural research

220
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,400
to find out

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,760
what cultural factors

222
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,880
are shared by parents in Western countries

223
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
to make them

224
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,280
more likely to suffer from parental burnout.

225
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,880
Before we start

226
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
our research,

227
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,600
we may be curious about

228
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,560
what a cultural research

229
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
should do.

230
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,840
Obviously,

231
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
culture includes many concepts.

232
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
It includes ideas,

233
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
beliefs,

234
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,840
behaviors,

235
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
and traditions.

236
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,120
These things

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,720
are all part of our culture.

238
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
How can we

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,080
conduct a research

240
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,720
on such a complex issue?

241
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,600
Fortunately,

242
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,360
some research has shown us

243
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,840
that different cultures

244
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,160
have certain ways

245
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,040
to distinguish different cultural characteristics.

246
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,840
We call this

247
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
a pre-existing

248
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,120
theoretical framework.

249
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,800
As researchers,

250
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,720
if we are curious

251
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
about the cultural factors

252
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,000
that can explain

253
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
why parents

254
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,600
suffer from parental burnout,

255
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,080
we may be able to

256
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,720
use the theory structure

257
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
of cultural differences

258
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
in the past

259
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
to explain

260
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,560
whether these cultural factors

261
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,680
can predict

262
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,640
parental burnout.

263
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
This is a very intuitive

264
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,800
and simple research.

265
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,760
On the other hand,

266
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,280
we can imagine

267
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
that parental burnout

268
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,040
is a very specific phenomenon.

269
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,240
It occurs in

270
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,000
our parental environment.

271
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,240
We may doubt

272
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
that if we use

273
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,280
the general theoretical framework

274
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,160
to explain

275
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
parental burnout,

276
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,160
we may ignore

277
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,520
the important

278
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,680
cultural concept of parental burnout.

279
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
It may be that

280
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
we can predict

281
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,520
that parental burnout

282
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,640
is a very important concept

283
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
and we ignore it.

284
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
In order to make up

285
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,200
for this phenomenon,

286
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,960
in addition to using

287
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
a very simple

288
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,880
or straightforward

289
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,160
research trend like TopDown,

290
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,120
the bottom-up approach

291
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
is that we don't hold

292
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,840
any research assumptions.

293
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,400
We directly ask a research question

294
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,440
and collect data.

295
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
We directly

296
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,280
let our theoretical framework

297
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
appear in our data.

298
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
This research method

299
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
is very important.

300
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,640
We have to use this method

301
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
to explore

302
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,200
what kind of phenomenon

303
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
can help us understand

304
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,000
the cross-cultural difference

305
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,960
of parental burnout.

306
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
So, based on this point of view,

307
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
we basically use

308
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,920
these two sets of different

309
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
research trends.

310
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,000
We designed

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,520
six series of research.

312
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,560
In the first part,

313
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,960
we want to explore

314
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,000
the research question just mentioned.

315
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
Why is it that

316
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
the parents

317
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
with what kind of

318
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
shared causes

319
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
are more likely to

320
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
be affected by

321
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,840
parental burnout?

322
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
In addition to using

323
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,640
the TopDown Research Approach

324
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,720
to find these cultural causes,

325
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,160
we also want to understand

326
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
why these cultural causes

327
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,000
and these seemingly far-reaching concepts

328
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,880
can be connected

329
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,280
to the bottom-up approach

330
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
of parental burnout.

331
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,280
We want to explore

332
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,200
the mechanism

333
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
in the system.

334
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,720
We also use

335
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,640
the bottom-up approach

336
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,560
to find other cultural causes

337
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,120
and other possible explanations

338
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,480
as to why these cultural causes

339
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,120
can predict

340
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,680
the theoretical mechanism

341
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
of parental burnout.

342
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
We researchers

343
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,840
don't just want to

344
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
confine ourselves

345
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
in an academic ivory tower.

346
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,920
We also hope to provide

347
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
a theoretical framework

348
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
for our research

349
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,560
and the phenomena we create.

350
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
We also hope that

351
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,960
if it can help

352
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,880
our parents

353
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,520
when they are

354
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,360
at work,

355
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
or when they are

356
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,200
interacting with their parents,

357
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,240
we can help them.

358
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,640
So, for our theoretical framework,

359
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
we also try to

360
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
come up with a practical framework.

361
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
We try to find

362
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,480
if my theoretical framework

363
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,280
can help us find

364
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,920
some protective factors

365
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,680
that can protect our parents.

366
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay.

367
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,320
Let's start

368
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,080
with my first series of research.

369
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
We use the top-down approach

370
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
to understand

371
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,440
the cultural differences

372
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,800
in parental burnout.

373
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,240
As I mentioned,

374
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
culture includes

375
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,840
many different concepts.

376
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,800
It includes ideas,

377
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,600
beliefs,

378
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,400
values,

379
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
and many other concepts.

380
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,560
Fortunately,

381
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
there are some

382
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,920
well-known

383
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
and robust

384
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
theoretical frameworks

385
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,600
that can help us

386
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,240
understand

387
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,320
the cultural differences

388
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
in different countries.

389
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
One of the most well-known

390
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,400
is Hofstede's Six Cultural Concepts.

391
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,280
It includes

392
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,560
the six factors.

393
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
Among the six factors,

394
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
we see

395
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
that individualism

396
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
or collativism

397
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
is a cultural concept.

398
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
It refers to

399
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,880
if a country

400
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
pays special attention to

401
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,720
individualism,

402
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,680
a cultural concept,

403
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,880
it will rely on

404
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,600
people who are close to it

405
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
rather than

406
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,160
other people.

407
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,760
It is a cultural value

408
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,560
that is prevalent in Western countries.

409
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,680
We can imagine

410
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,360
that

411
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
based on such a cultural structure,

412
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,840
we can imagine

413
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,360
that if Western countries

414
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,240
are prone to parental burnout,

415
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
will the

416
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,120
cultural value

417
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,360
that is prevalent in Western countries

418
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
explain

419
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,200
the cultural differences

420
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
in parental burnout?

421
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
In order to validate

422
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,080
our assumptions,

423
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,440
we collected

424
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
more than 10,000 parental data

425
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
across 42 countries.

426
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,800
We tried to explain

427
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,320
and answer

428
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,200
our research assumptions.

429
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,960
We basically

430
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,840
did a feedback analysis.

431
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
We can see

432
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,600
that when we control

433
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,640
various social demographic factors,

434
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,000
that is,

435
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,040
after the population changes,

436
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,920
we can see that

437
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,080
among the six cultural values,

438
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,400
only individualism

439
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,520
is particularly prevalent

440
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,680
in Western countries.

441
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,920
The cultural value

442
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,200
can predict

443
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,960
the prevalence of parental burnout

444
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,600
and its severity.

445
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
However,

446
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,240
we also talked about

447
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,400
the fact that

448
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
culture

449
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,240
has different aspects.

450
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Individualism

451
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
is simply a Western value.

452
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,320
It also has

453
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,120
different aspects.

454
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Some people

455
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
focus on themselves

456
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,520
because they want to improve themselves

457
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,680
and make better progress.

458
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
But why do some people

459
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
believe in individualism?

460
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,120
Maybe it's because

461
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,800
they don't believe in others

462
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
and don't care about others.

463
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
So we can imagine

464
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
that even if individualism

465
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,560
is a very

466
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,320
macro

467
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,960
or abstract concept,

468
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,640
it actually has different aspects

469
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
to explain

470
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
the cultural value.

471
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
So we have to use

472
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,880
a more detailed cultural structure

473
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,720
to explain

474
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
what aspects

475
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,520
of individualism

476
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,240
can explain

477
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,560
the cultural value.

478
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,240
So we try to use

479
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,760
a different model.

480
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
In this model,

481
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
we can see that

482
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
individualism,

483
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,080
which is a country

484
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,640
that emphasizes individualism,

485
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,160
individual individuals,

486
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,840
may have

487
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,560
different aspects.

488
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,640
For example,

489
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,080
they may want to

490
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,680
cultivate themselves

491
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
or they may

492
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,120
want to enjoy themselves more.

493
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,840
They may not care about others

494
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,920
or

495
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
they may not

496
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,000
do anything

497
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,520
that benefits others.

498
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,040
Or they may not

499
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,200
follow their traditions

500
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
or others.

501
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
We use

502
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
a more detailed

503
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,640
theoretical structure

504
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,880
to see

505
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,320
which aspect

506
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
of individualism

507
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,920
can explain

508
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,560
the cultural value.

509
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,800
In order to explain this,

510
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
in order to answer

511
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,880
our research questions,

512
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,800
we gathered

513
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
more than 600 parents in Poland.

514
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,800
We tried to use

515
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
the same research method

516
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
to run a return analysis.

517
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
We can see that

518
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,200
basically,

519
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,320
after we control

520
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,320
all the population changes,

521
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,320
in all the 10 cultural values,

522
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,360
only individualism

523
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,520
emphasizes personal achievement

524
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,240
and personal ownership

525
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
and power.

526
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
It doesn't want to

527
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,520
do anything that benefits others.

528
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,480
It can explain

529
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,840
more of our family values.

530
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,800
At this time,

531
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,760
we can think about

532
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
how to use

533
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,240
a more detailed theoretical structure.

534
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
We can see that

535
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,120
in this abstract cultural value,

536
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,200
in this cultural value of individualism,

537
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
some more detailed aspects,

538
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
achievement, power,

539
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
and less cultural value

540
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,520
that benefits others,

541
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,560
it can predict our family values.

542
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,960
Now, we can think about

543
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,240
what kind of people

544
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,960
will show

545
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,480
this value trend.

546
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Now,

547
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
you can think about

548
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,280
what kind of people

549
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,840
will have this value trend.

550
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,480
In fact, in past research,

551
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,120
it has been told to us

552
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,480
that

553
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,160
those who need to be perfect

554
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,680
and focus on making mistakes

555
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,240
are the perfect individuals.

556
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,200
It's easy for them to show

557
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
that they enjoy achievement,

558
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
power,

559
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,960
and less perfection

560
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
and become perfect individuals.

561
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
It's easy for them to show

562
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,200
this kind of value trend.

563
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
So, we can imagine

564
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,840
from the research just now,

565
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,680
we can see that

566
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,120
in different aspects of individualism,

567
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,800
perfectionism may be

568
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,080
a very important factor

569
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,360
to predict our family values.

570
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
We can also infer that

571
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,000
perhaps in the family environment,

572
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,800
the parents who emphasize perfectionism

573
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,520
are particularly likely to be affected by family ties.

574
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,640
But we may be curious

575
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,720
that the emphasis on perfectionism

576
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,360
in the family environment

577
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,800
is actually similar to

578
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,560
our personality.

579
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,280
It's a feeling

580
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,240
that we may feel

581
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,320
in the family

582
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,000
with our family ties.

583
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,320
These two concepts

584
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
are very different.

585
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
Why are they connected?

586
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
So, we can think about

587
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,360
the mechanism

588
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,320
of perfectionism.

589
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,240
We want to know

590
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,920
what kind of internal mechanism

591
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,680
can explain these two very different concepts.

592
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,160
So, let's think again.

593
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,440
In our family environment

594
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,440
or in the environment where we raise children,

595
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
what kind of situation is it?

596
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
It's actually a very dynamic

597
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,840
and chaotic situation.

598
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,880
Sometimes, children may cry.

599
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,760
But when they cry,

600
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
there is no special reason.

601
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,440
At this time, if our parents

602
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
may naturally

603
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,520
express their negative emotions,

604
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,600
we can imagine

605
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
that the dynamic environment of this family

606
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,520
will gradually become a vicious cycle.

607
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,560
There will be more and more negative emotions in it.

608
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,880
At this time, if we want to solve

609
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
such a negative cycle quickly,

610
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,040
we may have to adopt

611
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,360
some highly efficient

612
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
emotional adjustment strategies.

613
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,040
Our parents may adopt

614
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,520
such an emotional control.

615
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,560
They must control their negative emotions

616
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,120
and not show it to their children.

617
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,920
This kind of emotional adjustment.

618
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,320
We can also imagine that

619
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,720
especially those parents

620
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,800
who particularly emphasize that they need to be perfect,

621
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,720
they will particularly want to adopt

622
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,800
such an emotional adjustment

623
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,560
to control each other's emotions.

624
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,040
So, we can assume

625
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,880
why our parenting professionalism

626
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,120
emphasizes perfectionism

627
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,680
in the family environment.

628
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,360
It is related to parenting.

629
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
Maybe it's because such a characteristic

630
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,800
will make it easier for our parents

631
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,880
to control their emotions

632
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,480
and not show it to their children.

633
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
This kind of suppression

634
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
or expressive suppression

635
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,280
is an emotional adjustment strategy.

636
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
In order to solve this problem,

637
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
in order to respond to

638
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,160
such a research hypothesis,

639
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,280
we have collected

640
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,000
more than 400 parents in Poland.

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
We can see that

642
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,040
the more our parents emphasize

643
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,520
that they want to be perfect,

644
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,000
the easier it will be for them

645
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,440
to adopt such an emotional adjustment strategy

646
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
to further affect

647
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,440
their children.

648
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,400
So, in conclusion,

649
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,520
we can see that

650
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
using the top-down research approach,

651
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
using the existing cultural structure,

652
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,920
we can see that

653
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,560
in the West,

654
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,720
Western parents

655
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,040
are particularly prone to

656
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
the influence of parental suppression.

657
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,280
This is especially related to their personalism.

658
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
More specifically,

659
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,720
it is related to their perfectionism.

660
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,800
So, why is such a cultural value

661
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,120
related to parental suppression?

662
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,760
Maybe it's because

663
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,960
such a cultural value

664
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,720
allows them to use more emotional control

665
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,640
and more suppression.

666
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
That's why

667
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,760
such a personalist effect is produced.

668
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
As I mentioned at the beginning,

669
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,800
in fact, culture

670
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
includes different levels.

671
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,920
We should not only use

672
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,760
the top-down research approach.

673
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
We should also use

674
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,800
the approach that is closer to the parents' environment.

675
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,000
We should visit our parents.

676
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,680
We should keep a fixed research question.

677
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,440
We should collect our data

678
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
and not make any research assumptions.

679
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,560
We should directly see

680
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,720
if there are any neglected changes

681
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
that can actually help us understand

682
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,240
the cultural difference of parental suppression.

683
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,160
So, with this in mind,

684
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,080
we also carried out our third research,

685
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
a bottom-up research approach.

686
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,400
We try to take such a research strategy

687
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,520
to see if there are any differences

688
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
in parental culture

689
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,360
or if there are any cultural factors

690
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
that are particularly prevalent in the West

691
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
that can explain parental parental suppression.

692
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
Okay.

693
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,840
In order to answer this question,

694
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,000
as we just said,

695
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
we have to immediately

696
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,280
raise a research question

697
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,680
and collect the data

698
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
without making any research assumptions.

699
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,920
So, the question we raise here

700
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
might be,

701
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,680
what is the culture of parenting in Western countries?

702
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
What characteristics

703
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,320
can describe Western parenting culture?

704
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,680
To answer this question,

705
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,560
we might be able to directly think about

706
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,920
what kind of parenting culture

707
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
and how to collect such data.

708
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,040
We can imagine that

709
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
in fact, in different parenting cultures,

710
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,440
there will be a very specific model performance.

711
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,520
We can imagine that some parents

712
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,680
may fantasize that

713
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,120
what kind of good parents

714
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,160
they imagine in their mind.

715
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,240
The good parents in their mind

716
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,120
may be able to show

717
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,280
the characteristics of different parenting cultures.

718
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,800
So, we directly ask the parents.

719
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
We directly visit

720
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,080
the thousands of mothers and fathers

721
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
across 37 different countries.

722
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,440
We ask them,

723
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
in your mind,

724
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,480
if you can only use five characteristics

725
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,480
to describe the good...

726
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,280
model father and model mother in your mind,

727
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,800
how would you describe their characteristics?

728
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,320
I will pause for about a minute.

729
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
Although there are only five of us,

730
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,800
we can imagine that

731
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,600
if you are a parent,

732
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,520
you are already a parent,

733
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,400
or you are not a parent yet,

734
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,760
you can imagine

735
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,200
that if we want to describe a model parent,

736
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
you only use five characteristics to describe them,

737
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
how would you describe them?

738
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
Yes, I will pause for a minute.

739
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,880
If you have any questions at this time,

740
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
you can also ask.

741
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Okay.

742
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Okay.

743
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,200
You may already have some ideas in your mind.

744
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I will tell you what we saw in our research.

745
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,000
We found that

746
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
in Western countries,

747
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,480
they do have a very special pattern.

748
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,080
Their good parents...

749
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,640
They do have a fixed idea

750
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,000
about good parents.

751
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
We did find that,

752
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,000
especially in some Western countries

753
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,080
that speak English,

754
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,720
including the United States,

755
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Canada,

756
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,000
Australia,

757
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,840
the UK,

758
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,000
and European countries,

759
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,880
and even Russia,

760
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,680
and some countries that speak French,

761
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,520
they particularly emphasize

762
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,080
that when they describe those model parents,

763
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,400
they emphasize

764
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
that they need to show love,

765
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,720
that they need to show patience,

766
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,080
that they need to pay attention,

767
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,200
that they need to listen to their children.

768
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,440
These are different characteristics.

769
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,840
What do these characteristics show?

770
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,080
They show that

771
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,480
in these different Western cultures,

772
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,920
what they emphasize is

773
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,600
to show positive emotions

774
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,480
and to control negative emotions.

775
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,760
This is a characteristic.

776
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,880
In the past, research has shown

777
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,000
that this type of education

778
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,200
is actually a so-called positive education.

779
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,320
Positive education refers to

780
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,640
showing positive emotions

781
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,520
and controlling negative emotions.

782
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,160
So, from this research,

783
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,320
we can see that

784
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,880
using this pattern approach,

785
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,000
we can see that Western education

786
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,360
emphasizes emotional performance.

787
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,840
This emotional performance

788
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,160
is to show positive emotions

789
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,040
and control negative emotions.

790
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,800
At this time,

791
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,480
we may want to ask a question.

792
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,360
Why does such a

793
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,760
seemingly beautiful thing

794
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,120
show positive emotions

795
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
and control negative emotions?

796
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,520
This kind of education strategy

797
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,160
may be related to

798
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,880
the parent-child relationship.

799
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,400
So, after our research,

800
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,360
we further asked

801
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,320
if there is a mechanism

802
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
to explain this.

803
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,560
We can imagine that

804
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,080
positive parenting

805
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,320
or showing positive emotions

806
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
and controlling negative emotions

807
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,440
is a form of emotional performance.

808
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,840
When our parents

809
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,120
have this model image of their parents,

810
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
what do they need to do?

811
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,680
Basically,

812
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,560
they feel that

813
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,720
in the process of raising children,

814
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,280
they need to control themselves

815
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,120
and achieve this emotional performance strategy.

816
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,600
They need to tell themselves

817
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,440
that they need to show positive emotions

818
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,640
and control negative emotions.

819
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,600
To a certain extent,

820
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
it is an emotional performance strategy.

821
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,800
When an emotional performance strategy occurs,

822
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,560
when there is such an emotional performance strategy,

823
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,160
our parents may have to act.

824
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,760
When they are not happy,

825
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,360
when they have a lot of negative emotions,

826
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,200
they have to try to

827
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
put a smile on their face

828
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,360
in front of their children.

829
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,560
They have to make their appearance

830
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,760
in line with this emotional performance strategy.

831
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,360
On the other hand,

832
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,760
some parents may

833
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,560
try to use different methods

834
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
to make themselves

835
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,560
look unhappy

836
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,120
from the moment

837
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,480
to find some happy feelings.

838
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
Whether it is

839
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,760
simply controlling your appearance

840
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,680
or simply changing

841
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,400
your inner feelings,

842
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,760
these different emotions

843
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,240
are actually a kind of acting

844
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
to a certain extent.

845
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
They are all trying to

846
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
show and perform

847
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,840
a positive education strategy

848
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,280
in front of our children.

849
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,640
We can also easily imagine

850
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,360
that this set of emotional labor

851
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,960
or emotional performance

852
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,320
is actually very demanding.

853
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,480
We have to constantly monitor

854
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,640
whether our emotions

855
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,560
really fit

856
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,440
this set of emotional adjustment strategies.

857
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,760
So it requires us to put in effort

858
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,440
and put in our

859
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,920
cognitive ability.

860
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,120
Of course, as time goes by,

861
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,640
the more effort you put in,

862
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,440
the more pressure you may feel.

863
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,760
It's not that surprising

864
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,360
that some parents

865
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
may have burnout.

866
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,680
So this is a theoretical framework

867
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,600
that we came up with.

868
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,240
Why does positive parenting

869
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,880
have something to do

870
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,600
with the fact

871
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,080
that our children are in this situation?

872
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,000
We need to figure out

873
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,160
how we can do this.

874
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,800
We collected 347

875
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
parents' data.

876
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,800
We looked at

877
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,600
whether the theoretical framework

878
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
we came up with is true.

879
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,480
We saw that

880
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,160
the more parents

881
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,560
understand our environment,

882
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,760
the more they adopt

883
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,120
positive parenting strategies.

884
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
Positive parenting

885
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,640
emotional performance strategies.

886
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,320
The more they adopt

887
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,360
surface acting

888
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,160
or deep acting

889
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,760
emotional performance

890
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,200
emotional adjustment strategies,

891
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,840
the more cognitive resources

892
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,080
these parents use

893
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,880
to make it easier for them

894
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,920
to be affected by burnout.

895
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,240
We also saw in our statistical analysis

896
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,160
that this model

897
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,560
is a great way to explain

898
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,000
the data in our data.

899
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,320
It's a great way to explain

900
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,480
the results of our data.

901
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Okay.

902
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,520
Basically,

903
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,920
based on all the research

904
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,560
we've done so far,

905
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,280
from a top-down research approach,

906
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,520
we can see that

907
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
this cultural strategy,

908
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,840
this cultural value

909
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,880
of individualism

910
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,800
and this cultural value

911
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
of perfectionism

912
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,640
will allow our parents

913
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,920
to use a lot of

914
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,960
emotional adjustment

915
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,760
to further predict their burnout.

916
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,400
From a bottom-up approach,

917
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,160
we can see that

918
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,240
if we want to describe

919
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Western culture,

920
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
positive parenting,

921
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,640
especially their emotional

922
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,240
positive parenting,

923
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,080
they have to

924
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,520
show a lot of positive emotions.

925
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,960
They have to control their emotions.

926
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,520
Positive parenting

927
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,480
will make our parents

928
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,920
have to act emotionally

929
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,680
in front of their children

930
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,240
to explain their burnout.

931
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,600
Combining these two aspects of research,

932
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,720
we can see

933
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,160
why this culture

934
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,960
will make parents

935
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,880
more likely to be affected by burnout.

936
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,560
To a certain extent,

937
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,600
it's because

938
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,240
they've adopted

939
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,040
very powerful emotional adjustment.

940
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,120
They've adopted a lot of

941
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
willful emotions

942
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,560
in front of their children

943
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,720
or they've adopted

944
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
a powerful emotional adjustment

945
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,360
to act in front of their children.

946
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
At this time,

947
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
as we said at the beginning,

948
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,040
as researchers,

949
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,160
we don't just want to stay

950
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,960
in the theoretical framework.

951
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,600
We also hope that

952
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
the theoretical framework

953
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,160
will be helpful

954
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
to our parents

955
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,240
and will be helpful

956
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,680
to our food environment.

957
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,400
So, for our theoretical framework,

958
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,760
we also try to find

959
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,440
ways to protect our children.

960
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,320
We try to think from another perspective

961
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,360
on how to help our parents.

962
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,160
First of all, we just mentioned

963
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,680
why Western culture

964
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,440
will make parents

965
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
more likely to be affected by burnout.

966
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,640
It's because they've adopted

967
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
more powerful

968
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
emotional adjustment strategies.

969
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
At this time, we want to say

970
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,360
if we can stop this thing,

971
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
we can prevent our parents

972
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,520
from adopting so many

973
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,360
negative emotional adjustments,

974
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,680
will our parents be protected?

975
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,760
From another perspective,

976
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,040
if our parents

977
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,360
can control their emotions

978
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,480
more efficiently and intelligently,

979
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,560
will their risk of

980
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,640
child abuse

981
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
be lower?

982
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,360
Based on this study,

983
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,480
we did our first study.

984
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,240
We did our first study.

985
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,520
We want to see

986
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,440
if our parents

987
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,720
really have a better ability

988
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
to control their emotions,

989
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,360
will their risk of child abuse

990
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,760
be lower?

991
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,720
Based on this study,

992
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
we measured

993
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
the emotional intelligence of parents,

994
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,560
which is their ability to

995
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,440
identify,

996
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
to express,

997
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,440
to understand,

998
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,320
and to adjust

999
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,360
and use their emotions.

1000
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,600
We want to see

1001
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,840
if this ability

1002
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,320
is related to

1003
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,680
child abuse.

1004
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,960
We collected data from different countries.

1005
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,600
We collected data from Belgium.

1006
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,520
We found that

1007
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,200
regardless of which measurement

1008
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,160
we used,

1009
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
regardless of which measurement

1010
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
we used,

1011
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,160
if our parents

1012
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,520
can use their emotions

1013
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
more intelligently,

1014
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
their risk of child abuse

1015
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
will be lower.

1016
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,600
Our emotional intelligence

1017
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,560
can predict the risk of

1018
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,800
child abuse

1019
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
for our parents.

1020
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Indeed,

1021
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,680
if our parents have better emotional intelligence,

1022
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,000
we can protect them

1023
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,360
from the risk of child abuse.

1024
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,160
However,

1025
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,040
as we mentioned,

1026
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
we can see from the definition

1027
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,560
that emotional intelligence

1028
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,880
can include...

1029
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
We just mentioned

1030
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
that it's related to

1031
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
identification,

1032
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,320
expression,

1033
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,800
understanding,

1034
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,160
and using emotions.

1035
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,920
It can be someone else's emotions

1036
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,440
or our own emotions.

1037
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,880
It can also be

1038
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,240
intrapersonal

1039
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,640
or interpersonal.

1040
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,480
Intrapersonal

1041
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,160
refers to a person

1042
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,840
who can

1043
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,360
identify,

1044
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,040
express,

1045
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,720
understand,

1046
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
and adjust

1047
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,960
their own emotions.

1048
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,480
It can also be intrapersonal.

1049
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
It can identify,

1050
00:34:59,480 --> 00:34:59,920
express,

1051
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,160
or understand

1052
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,760
other people's emotions.

1053
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,760
We want to ask

1054
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,360
if emotional intelligence

1055
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,440
can be classified

1056
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,240
as intrapersonal

1057
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,320
or interpersonal,

1058
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,840
will it have the same effect

1059
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,920
on child abuse?

1060
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,080
First of all,

1061
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,800
we collected...

1062
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,200
We used

1063
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,480
a different set of data.

1064
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,280
We collected data

1065
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,760
on parents

1066
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
and children.

1067
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,680
We found that

1068
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,400
if we only focus

1069
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,600
on

1070
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,160
parents

1071
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,560
who have

1072
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,880
better emotional intelligence,

1073
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,120
their child abuse,

1074
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,960
regardless of the country,

1075
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,840
we can see that

1076
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
this set of abilities

1077
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,600
can greatly reduce

1078
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
the chance of child abuse.

1079
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
However,

1080
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
if we only focus on

1081
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,960
controlling,

1082
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,880
understanding,

1083
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,600
and identifying other people's emotions,

1084
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,640
this intrapersonal competence

1085
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,720
affects our child abuse

1086
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,120
not only in proportion,

1087
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,160
but also in proportion.

1088
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,440
We can see that

1089
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,400
it basically predicts

1090
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,080
the effect of child abuse.

1091
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,840
In other words,

1092
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,720
from a humanistic perspective,

1093
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,920
in a humanistic language,

1094
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,320
it basically means

1095
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,400
understanding other people's emotions

1096
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
or using other people's emotions

1097
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,720
to do something related to others.

1098
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,000
This kind of emotional intelligence

1099
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,480
will put parents

1100
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,240
in danger.

1101
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,320
So we came to a conclusion.

1102
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,880
Interpersonal emotional intelligence

1103
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,120
not only has less positive effects,

1104
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,280
it may even

1105
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
put parents

1106
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,920
in more danger of child abuse.

1107
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,200
So,

1108
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,840
based on this study,

1109
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,880
to a certain extent,

1110
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
we can say that

1111
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,240
if we can

1112
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,760
help parents

1113
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,160
to control their emotions

1114
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
and understand their emotions better,

1115
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,520
their child abuse will be less.

1116
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,400
However,

1117
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,720
based on the second study,

1118
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,800
we actually need to

1119
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,440
further refine this study.

1120
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,000
Basically,

1121
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,800
only when parents

1122
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,080
are controlling

1123
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,120
their own emotions,

1124
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,960
their child abuse will be reduced.

1125
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,440
If we control other people's emotions,

1126
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,000
they may be more

1127
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,160
affected by child abuse.

1128
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,840
So, in fact,

1129
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,880
doing research is a bit like this.

1130
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,440
We will always look at

1131
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,120
different aspects more carefully.

1132
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,840
We may get different results.

1133
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
This is the first

1134
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,760
study conclusion we got.

1135
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,080
It actually brings

1136
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,440
a very important conclusion.

1137
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,720
If parents

1138
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,440
have better emotional intelligence,

1139
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,480
their child abuse

1140
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,880
will be less.

1141
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,160
In fact, the good news is

1142
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
that in our past studies,

1143
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
we have seen that

1144
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
as long as we spend

1145
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,680
15 hours,

1146
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
we can teach

1147
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
an individual

1148
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,200
how to learn

1149
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,520
and control our emotions

1150
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,880
or how to

1151
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,960
identify our emotions

1152
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,360
in a good way.

1153
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
From another perspective,

1154
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,960
we also care about

1155
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,840
individual's own ability

1156
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,560
and emotional intelligence.

1157
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
In fact, we are also curious

1158
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,360
if we can start from

1159
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,480
the interaction between people

1160
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,920
and the interaction between people

1161
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,680
to find some

1162
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
protective factors

1163
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,080
that can help parents.

1164
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
In fact, this perspective

1165
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,840
also comes from

1166
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,560
the research we just started.

1167
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,720
We see that

1168
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,200
the individual's

1169
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,600
individualism

1170
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,280
actually puts parents

1171
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,000
at risk of child abuse.

1172
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
We just mentioned

1173
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,560
what individualism is.

1174
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,040
Individualism refers to

1175
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
a person who is very focused on

1176
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
relying on himself.

1177
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,640
He is less dependent on other people's help.

1178
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,960
This kind of ability

1179
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
and this kind of cultural value.

1180
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,680
In fact, from another perspective,

1181
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
if our parents

1182
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,880
can rely on others better,

1183
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,000
if they can get

1184
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,360
the resources from others better,

1185
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,280
that is, if they have better

1186
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,600
social support,

1187
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,640
the chances of child abuse

1188
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
will be less.

1189
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,280
So we also proposed this assumption.

1190
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,920
If parents have better

1191
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,200
social support,

1192
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,400
the chances of child abuse

1193
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
will be lower.

1194
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,160
So to answer this question,

1195
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,120
we collected data from

1196
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,760
different countries,

1197
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,320
whether they are

1198
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,680
individualist countries

1199
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,520
or non-individualist countries.

1200
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,040
We collected data from Turkey.

1201
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,240
We collected data from Peru.

1202
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,600
We collected data from Poland and Belgium.

1203
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,840
We collected data from

1204
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,320
any country.

1205
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,240
We can see that

1206
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,720
in the results of the return analysis,

1207
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
we controlled all

1208
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,720
the data on population changes.

1209
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,800
We found that

1210
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,280
our parents' social support

1211
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,440
is indeed one of the most important

1212
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,640
protective measures

1213
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,920
to protect our parents

1214
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,480
from child abuse.

1215
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
So from this result,

1216
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,040
we actually learned

1217
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
another thing.

1218
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,880
In fact, as long as we can

1219
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,000
let our parents understand

1220
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,400
that when they are

1221
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,600
taking care of their children,

1222
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,880
when they are interacting

1223
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,480
with their children,

1224
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,560
they are not alone.

1225
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,120
In fact, if they can

1226
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,840
get resources from their environment,

1227
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,800
our parents can

1228
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,200
avoid the risk of

1229
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,160
being abducted

1230
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,480
and abducted.

1231
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,800
So basically, this is a very important

1232
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,320
second protective factor that we saw.

1233
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,160
At the end, I want to sum up

1234
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,200
the different studies

1235
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,680
I talked about today

1236
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,040
to make a conclusion.

1237
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,280
In fact, through these six

1238
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,480
series of studies,

1239
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,160
what information did we get?

1240
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,760
The first message we got was

1241
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,680
that Western culture

1242
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,320
does put parents

1243
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,960
at risk of child abduction.

1244
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,400
We saw from the top-down approach

1245
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,520
that Western individualism,

1246
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,320
especially their perfectionism,

1247
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,400
will make parents

1248
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,040
take more suppression,

1249
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,080
emotional adjustment.

1250
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,440
On the other hand,

1251
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,360
we can see from the bottom-up

1252
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,240
research approach

1253
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,360
that what can show

1254
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,600
Western parenting

1255
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,800
is positive education,

1256
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
especially positive emotions,

1257
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,560
controlling each other's emotions,

1258
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,360
such a positive parenting strategy.

1259
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,440
It will make our parents

1260
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,040
feel like they have to

1261
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,000
act in front of their children,

1262
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,440
especially in terms of emotions.

1263
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,400
No matter what kind of emotional adjustment,

1264
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,200
suppression or emotional labor,

1265
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,400
they are all very powerful.

1266
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,320
These powerful emotional adjustments

1267
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,920
will naturally make parents

1268
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,080
more likely to be affected

1269
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,480
by child abduction.

1270
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
Through this theoretical framework,

1271
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,600
we also try to understand

1272
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
another thing.

1273
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,560
Indeed, Western culture

1274
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,880
will make our parents

1275
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
more likely to be affected by child abduction,

1276
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,640
but our environment...

1277
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
But from another perspective,

1278
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,560
if we can teach our parents

1279
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,480
how to better interact

1280
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,560
with their emotions,

1281
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,920
or if we can find ways

1282
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,040
to get more social support

1283
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,840
from our parents,

1284
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
it can actually protect our parents

1285
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,640
from being affected by child abduction.

1286
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,560
These are the two most important

1287
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,160
take-home messages

1288
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,600
in my speech today.

1289
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,040
Today, I basically

1290
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,480
summarized my research

1291
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
over the past two years

1292
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,960
in a very quick overview.

1293
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,440
I listed the eight articles

1294
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,880
that we published in the past,

1295
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,560
which is the main

1296
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,520
take-home message I reported today.

1297
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,560
You can see that

1298
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
our lab and I

1299
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
put our past articles

1300
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,240
on our lab website.

1301
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,360
If you are interested

1302
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,120
in learning more about the details,

1303
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,720
especially in today's speech,

1304
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I didn't...

1305
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,480
I didn't go into the details of statistics

1306
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
or analysis.

1307
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,480
If you are interested

1308
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,600
in the details,

1309
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,960
you can read these articles

1310
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
directly.

1311
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,520
Okay.

1312
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,480
In the end,

1313
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,920
we have to talk about

1314
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,320
some guidelines in all our research.

1315
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,440
As I said in my speech today,

1316
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,320
it's like I'm the only one

1317
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,960
doing all this research.

1318
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
But it's not like that.

1319
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,560
All the research

1320
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,320
is a joint effort

1321
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,920
for all of us.

1322
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,720
So, I have to say thank you.

1323
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,280
First of all,

1324
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,080
of course, my two professors

1325
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,960
and my long-term

1326
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,240
partners.

1327
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,800
The most important thing is

1328
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,720
that we have hundreds of

1329
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,800
researchers all over the world.

1330
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,000
We are also

1331
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,960
doing research on

1332
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,000
the concept of parent-child bondage

1333
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,880
and trying to find ways

1334
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,080
to help our parents.

1335
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,920
So, we have to thank

1336
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,480
all the partners

1337
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,680
and researchers

1338
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,000
who have worked together.

1339
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
Lastly,

1340
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,120
as we have been talking about

1341
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,960
in the research,

1342
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,120
some parents

1343
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,600
are already very bondage.

1344
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,840
They may have

1345
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,160
been affected by parent-child bondage.

1346
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,520
But they still

1347
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,600
spend their precious time

1348
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,560
to help us fill in

1349
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,480
these questions

1350
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,920
or help us complete our research.

1351
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,480
So, we have to thank

1352
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,080
our parents

1353
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,200
especially parents

1354
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,600
from different countries

1355
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,040
who have done so much for us.

1356
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,600
Okay.

1357
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,640
So, this is a quick overview

1358
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,360
of my presentation today.

1359
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,600
It took me about 45 minutes in total.

1360
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,480
So, I have about

1361
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,000
10 to 15 minutes left.

1362
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,320
If you have any questions,

1363
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,360
we can discuss them together.

1364
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,080
Thank you, Ya Hui.

1365
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Thank you, Gao Xian.

1366
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,920
On behalf of the audience,

1367
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
I would like to say thank you to Gao Xian

1368
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,240
for bringing a very comprehensive

1369
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,400
and rich presentation.

1370
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,360
If I were not a student

1371
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,520
doing research in this field,

1372
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,400
I would be able to

1373
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,520
understand the essence of this topic

1374
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,160
in your 45-minute presentation.

1375
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,600
So, thank you, Gao Xian.

1376
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,280
At this stage,

1377
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,320
I would like to pause the recording

1378
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,880
and we can start

1379
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,400
Q&A and various discussions.
