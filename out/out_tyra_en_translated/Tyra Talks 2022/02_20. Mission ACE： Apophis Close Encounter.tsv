0	5000	Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.
5000	10000	Today we are very honored to invite Dr. Liao Ying to talk about his research.
10000	20000	Today's topic is Mission ACE.
20000	24000	Before we start, let me briefly introduce Dr. Liao Ying.
24000	27000	Dr. Liao Ying graduated from the University of Bern, Switzerland.
27000	30000	Dr. Liao Ying specializes in space and astrophysics.
30000	33000	He is currently a professor at Tsinghua University,
33000	37000	teaching space exploration theory and practice.
37000	41000	Our tradition is to mute everyone,
41000	44000	so that the speech will be more smooth.
44000	47000	But before we start, please unmute yourself,
47000	49000	so that the speaker can hear our applause.
49000	56000	Let's welcome today's speaker with a round of applause.
56000	59000	Thank you.
59000	63000	I will probably speak a little faster.
63000	67000	Let me briefly introduce myself.
67000	70000	My master's degree is in astrophysics.
70000	73000	After that, I went to Switzerland to study.
73000	78000	We are still in the physics institute.
78000	80000	Our school has three branches.
80000	86000	One of the branches is called Space Science and Planetary Research.
86000	92000	In Chinese, it stands for 太空與新興科學.
92000	101000	The entire branch focuses on things like NASA and JPL.
101000	107000	I did a two-year postdoc at the University of Macau.
107000	112000	Then I came back to Taiwan for COVID-19.
112000	120000	I have been teaching at Tsinghua University since last year.
120000	131000	I teach space exploration theory and practice.
131000	134000	I teach in English.
134000	139000	Tsinghua University does not teach space science,
139000	143000	so I thought this would be a good place to start.
143000	149000	I am interested in solar systems,
149000	154000	such as comets, asteroids,
154000	159000	and space mission design.
159000	164000	In 2019, I took part in a competition called
164000	170000	CubeSat Mission Design Contest.
170000	176000	I am interested in space mission design.
176000	183000	I saw the competition in early 2019,
183000	186000	so I decided to take part in it.
187000	193000	I found two of my teammates.
193000	197000	We designed a mission together.
197000	204000	We were lucky to win first place.
204000	213000	Since then, I have been doing research on space mission design.
213000	216000	I can't say it is a rigorous research.
216000	221000	The topic I am going to talk about today is still a proposal.
221000	224000	My name is Ace.
224000	230000	It is a very preliminary proposal.
230000	238000	If you know a little bit about space mission design,
238000	243000	space mission design is very complicated.
243000	250000	It requires a lot of manpower and time to do different things.
250000	253000	I will explain it later.
253000	260000	This is a proposal from our team.
260000	267000	This is for another international space mission design competition,
267000	270000	Mission Idea Contest.
270000	274000	This is a proposal for this competition.
274000	279000	We advanced to the finals, but we did not win.
279000	289000	I would like to briefly explain Mission Idea Contest.
289000	294000	It is an international space mission design competition.
294000	304000	It is organized by a non-profit organization called Unisec.
304000	309000	It is a non-profit organization.
310000	318000	It is organized by universities around the world.
318000	324000	It is organized by universities around the world.
324000	327000	It is organized by universities around the world.
327000	330000	Each country has a local chapter.
330000	333000	Taiwan has a local chapter.
333000	336000	Professor Zhuang is in charge of it.
336000	339000	This competition is held once a year.
339000	346000	This competition is held once a year.
346000	350000	There are three stages in this competition.
350000	354000	The first stage is to vote.
354000	357000	After the judges have finished voting,
357000	360000	they will enter the next stage.
361000	366000	The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.
366000	369000	The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.
369000	374000	The last stage is to submit a verbal report.
374000	377000	After submitting the verbal report,
377000	381000	the judges will choose two candidates.
381000	385000	This competition is quite tough.
385000	390000	The judges are mostly professors.
390000	393000	The judges are mostly professors.
393000	399000	Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.
399000	405000	Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.
405000	408000	We had a host of the competition that year.
408000	412000	We had a host of the competition that year.
412000	415000	Their judges are very strict.
415000	417000	I recommend this competition.
417000	420000	The judges are different every year.
420000	423000	The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.
423000	427000	The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.
427000	431000	The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.
431000	433000	2020 and 2021 are being held.
433000	436000	2020 is scheduled to be postponed for a year.
436000	439000	This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.
439000	442000	This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.
442000	445000	This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.
445000	447000	The definition of deep space is
447000	453000	the space beyond the moon.
453000	457000	However, they also included the mission of the moon in the Deep Space.
457000	462000	So, you can design a space ship to go to the moon.
462000	465000	This year and next year,
465000	469000	we will return to the Earth orbit mission design.
469000	474000	This is a 6U cube satellite design.
474000	479000	However, it requires a constellation.
479000	482000	You can send a lot of stars at once.
482000	486000	They will have different positions.
486000	491000	It's a bit like GPS satellites.
492000	495000	This is a link.
495000	499000	If you are interested in space mission design,
499000	502000	you can go to their website.
502000	505000	Their website is complete.
505000	508000	Last year, they had a talk.
508000	511000	Deep Space Mission Design is a difficult topic.
511000	516000	They had a talk with professors from the University of Tokyo.
516000	521000	They recorded the talk and posted it on their website.
521000	526000	They also posted some PDFs.
526000	531000	You can check them out.
531000	536000	I would like to talk about the background of space mission design.
536000	541000	First, you need to know about the spacecraft.
541000	546000	Spacecraft is the soul of space mission design.
546000	549000	I'm sorry.
549000	552000	I'm not used to speaking in Chinese.
552000	555000	I usually speak in English.
555000	558000	So, I might speak slowly or pause.
558000	568000	This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.
569000	572000	This is a picture of the spacecraft.
572000	577000	This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.
577000	584000	This is the attitude control.
584000	589000	This is the power.
589000	593000	This is the internal computer.
593000	598000	This is the command.
598000	603000	This is the communication.
603000	611000	This is the structure of the body.
611000	614000	This is the orbit.
614000	617000	This is the orbit.
618000	625000	You can connect the spacecraft to humans.
625000	630000	For example, the computer is like our brain.
630000	636000	Our brain receives, processes, and releases various commands.
636000	639000	We have a body.
639000	644000	Our body is the head and limbs.
644000	649000	Our body is the head and limbs.
649000	654000	Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.
654000	657000	Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.
657000	660000	Power is like food.
660000	663000	Power is like food.
663000	666000	Power is like food.
666020	671000	Everyone uses a rough metaphor.
671000	680000	It's called understanding space.
680000	683000	Use freedom as a metaphor.
683000	691000	There are six main functions.
691000	693000	There are six main functions.
693000	698000	There are six main functions.
698000	703000	The first one is the body part.
703000	706000	The first one is the body part.
706000	711000	In English, we call it the body.
711000	715000	This is a spaceship or a satellite.
715000	717000	This is a spaceship or a satellite.
717000	727000	In English, we call it a frame.
