00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on July 23, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Today's speech is given by Yan Ziqi.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
The title of his speech is

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
Ziqi is a doctoral candidate from the Department of Computer Science at Colorado University.

00:43.000 --> 00:58.000
He is interested in complex systems and the relationship between data, models, and algorithms.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
He gave a speech at Taira two years ago.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Please welcome Yan Ziqi.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello everyone.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
Thank you Jason for the introduction and thank you Taira for designing this platform for us to share our research.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
I'll share my screen now.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll start.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
My topic is Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
This network is not the Internet. It's a network with many nodes.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
There is an interaction between the nodes.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
It's called a network in English.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
The main content comes from a paper I wrote last year.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
I spent a lot of time listing all the references in this slide.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
Can you see my mouse?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yes.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
You can download my slides here.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
If you see this speech on YouTube, please go to my personal website.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
This link will not exist in the future.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
There are some things I need to update.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
But all the references in this slide have a button.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
You can click to see which paper I refer to.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
So what is data analysis on the Internet?

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
This field often asks questions from data.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Data in a complex system.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Data can be, for example, brain science data.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
For example, we do brain imaging.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
There may be some brain areas in the brain.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
We treat the brain area as a node.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
There may be some nodes.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Different brain areas will light up at the same time.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It works at the same time.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
We can connect it.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
This is a network.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
We can ask some questions above.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
For example, the structure of the brain area under different nodes.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
What is the difference in the structure of the brain area?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
For example, the ecological system.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
We can imagine that if we put each creature.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Between creatures, who eats who?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Then there is a food chain.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
This is also a network.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The chain is a tree.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But if it's a network, it's a food network.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
Other types, like what we usually see on the Internet.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
There is a network between different web pages.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Then we travel, we go to different places.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
It also forms a network.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Or a network between people.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
This article is an explanation.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
How to choose the right model when describing these complex systems.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Because some functions.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Some functions may be between two.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Like a graph in math.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Like this.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Between one point and another point, there are two functions.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
But sometimes, for example, we just said that the example of the brain area.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
We have a stimulus.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
There may be three different areas of the brain area that light up at the same time.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
At this time, we have three points that work for each other.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
These things may be more suitable.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Described by the so-called Higher-Order Network Analysis.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
So, uh, this article talks about some, uh, different, uh, data.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
How could there be some higher-order things in it?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And then, uh, uh, what model to choose, and so on.

05:31.000 --> 05:40.000
So, uh, my report today will focus on, uh, this single-body review.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
It's called Symbiotic Complex.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Right, and if there's any questions, you can interrupt me.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Okay, and I don't know what you think of when you hear Network Science.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And then, um, this is a recently published book.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
And then, uh, the last chapter talks about, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Talk about, uh, how to look forward in network science, and so on.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
And then he sorted out some different areas of the last 20 years.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Um, this is the field of paper, and then the number of them.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And then we can see, for example, uh, about infectious diseases.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Infectious diseases are, of course, a thing that has to do with the Internet.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
There's a lot of that in the last year or two.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
So, um, um, what I'm going to talk about today is more on this high-level Internet.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
It's Hypergraph or, uh, Symbiotic Complex.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Um, there's been a lot of that recently, but not as much as, uh, uh, Epidemic.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So, um, there's a lot of the same kind of numbers.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So, um, if you're interested, you can look it up.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And then, uh, I'm with, uh, uh, Li Zhengde from the University of Chenggong.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
The teacher also translated a small book.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And then this is also a link that you can click on.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
You can, uh, it's Chinese, and then there's a lot of examples.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
You can click on it.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
So, um, before I start this talk, I want to thank my instructors.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I have two instructors, Josh and Dan.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
And then they, um, I'm from Computer Science.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
And then, but they, uh, they have a strategy in math and biology.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
So, um, I'd like to thank the authors of this paper.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Especially, uh, Ronga and Aleche.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Because, uh, I was communicating with the two of them.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And then I found out that, uh, they did this article.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
There's a, there's an open problem.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
And then, um, um, so I started doing this open problem.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Okay.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
So, um, now we're going to talk about what I just said.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
There are some, uh, uh, ways to describe a complex system.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
And then I try to list, I try to divide it into three types.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Uh, graph, or this.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Hypergraph, or this.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
That's it.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Um, these three things are actually a, uh, a model choice.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That is, what data do you see?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
You can choose which model you want to use.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
And then you use that model.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Maybe you get the benefits of using that model.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
But maybe you lose some of the other properties.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
So, uh, uh, uh, this is a very good paper.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Uh, it should be used.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Uh, what kind of data should be used at what time?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
So, uh, let's say, uh, I see a data today.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Um, it's the data from the author and their paper.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
So that's actually what it is.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Which papers were issued by which authors?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Well, what about this data?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Um, his, uh, input is, is determined.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
That is, um, um, I know which authors I have in my data.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
But, uh, because I want to ask different questions.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
I can have different, uh, data, uh, data representation.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
For example, I can ask, uh, these two authors.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Have you ever written a paper together?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So this is you choose two people.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
And then they have written a paper.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Then you put it together.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
At that time, you will get this data.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
You can see if 1 and 2 have written a paper.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
And then there's writing on it.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
2 and 4 have written a paper.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
And then there's a lot here.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
For example, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3 also have.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 3, and then 3 and 4.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That's it.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
That kind of data is a, uh, a graph.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
This is a graph.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Then, um, you can ask a little more detail.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
For example, you say, do these people have, um, is to write a paper.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
So, at this time, there's something called HyperEdge.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
The extension of Edge is called HyperEdge.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Because in Edge, you have to choose two points.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But in HyperEdge, you can choose n points.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
At this time, you choose.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
In fact, it is four pieces of paper.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
You choose four.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
1, 2, 2, 4, and then 1, 2, 3.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Because now it's, uh, HyperGraph.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
So you can choose to come in.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
That's it.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Then there's a HyperGraph at this time.

10:19.000 --> 10:26.000
Then, um, you can also use Simplicial Complex to describe.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Um, this Simplicial Complex to describe.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
He's asking, uh, um.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It's a little, a little rough.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
So, um, uh, these people have written a piece of paper.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So, at this time, he's actually like HyperGraph.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
He just chose n people up.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And then it's called a Simplex.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
But this Simplicial Complex has a definition in math.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
It's defined as, um, you.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
After choosing a Simplex.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
You're going to put all the smaller, um, all the smaller Simplexes.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
All the Simplexes are included in this, this Simplicial Complex.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
For example, an example is if I choose 1, 2, 3.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
For example, 1, 2, 3, this, this, um.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Everyone writes paper.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
This thing is a, uh, a Simplex.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's in this data.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
I have to include 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 3.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Mathematically, it's like this.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So, uh, if we have this data.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
In fact, it's in this Simplicial Complex.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
It's going to be so many, so many.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
All the possible things are in it.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
It looks like a very, very.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
It's a big construct.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
And then, uh, it's because of his definition.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
That is, all the smaller subsets must be included in it.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
That, uh, that's because of that.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
We can use the biggest Simplex.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And then we call it Facets.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
To represent a Simplicial Complex.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
What does that mean?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
For example, we see this now.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
It looks like a lot of this data.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Then we can choose 1, 2, 3.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Because 1, 2, 3 looks big.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
After you choose 1, 2, 3.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It automatically includes 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So, in fact, there are some people who can.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Uh, don't, don't choose it.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Then 2, 4 will be less than 10 and 30.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
So, in fact, if, uh, this data.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
If you want to use Simplicial Complex to express it.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
You just need to say these three.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Uh, these three Facets are fine.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
That, uh, so this time I'll get one like this.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
One, one expression like this.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
That's what I'm talking about today.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
This work is more related.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
There are some other, uh.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
The term is called, uh.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Degree Sequence.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Or the degree distribution.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Then, or, Size Sequence.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Uh, Size Distribution.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I don't know what to do.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I think I'll use Side Sequence.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Um, what does that mean?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Um, Degree Sequence is, uh.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
If we look at the example of the picture,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Degree Sequence is, uh.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
How many neighbors does each point connect to?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
For example, this point is connected to 2.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And then this point is connected to three neighbors.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So this 3, 2.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
3, 2.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
These four numbers make up.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
The Degree Sequence of this picture.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Um, this sequence is not important.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Because it's a distribution.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That, but, uh.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
This thing, if it's in this.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
In the world of Simplicial Complex.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm going to be 1, 2, 2, 2.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
The reason is because, uh.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
This A1, this author.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
He's only connected to one side.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It's 1, 2, 3, this side.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So, uh, he's 1.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It's like a hand sticking out.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And then, like, this A2, this author.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
He's connected to this.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This 1, 2, 3, this.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Simplex.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
With 2, 4, this Simplex.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So his Degree Sequence is.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Uh, his Degree is 2.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
The above is the definition.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's about this.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Um, how to say it on a Simplicial Complex.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
His Degree.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
What is the sequence definition?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That, uh, related.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
There is also a word called Side Sequence.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Um, that is to say.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Every side of it.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
That is, every interaction of it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
What is its size?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Uh, actually, I should list it here.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Um, because this is a picture.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
This picture, every picture is.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Uh, his Interaction.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's made up of two.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
So this picture is a few sides.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There are a few 2s.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
For example, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is 5.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
5 2s make up this Side Sequence.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
That's it.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
If it's Hypergraph, it's 3.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Because there's a 1, 2, 3.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Interaction.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
3, 2, 2, 2.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Uh, Simplicial Complex.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Because I have three now.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So it's 3, 2, 2.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Okay, um.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Is there a problem with the current definition?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Okay, um.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
The job I'm going to talk about today.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Although I will go through a lot of other related information.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Uh, it's actually like this.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Um, I'm going to.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
My job is.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Suppose I was given.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Two groups of Sequence.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
One group is.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
2, 2, 2, 1.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And then the other group is.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
3, 2, 2.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Can I use these two groups?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The sequence of integers.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
To find a Simplicial Complex.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Make it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
The degree and.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
This.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
The order of size is just the two I just gave.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Sequence.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
That.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Um.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Not all.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
You can.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Find a structure like this.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Can correspond to each other.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Then I'll say I can't find it.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Then if I can find it.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
That's good.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I'll say why it's good.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Okay.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That, um.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
So we.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes, I'm going to enter the next video.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
So now we see this.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
This Simplicial Complex.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Because it.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
All the little subsets have to be included.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It looks like a very complicated thing.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
But it actually has some benefits.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
This is my first.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Uh, the first interlude is.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Um, insert.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Let everyone take a break.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
The second benefit.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
There is a field called Topological Data Analysis.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It can.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Use.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I include these.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Smaller subsets.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Then to calculate.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Some of the structures of this data.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
For example, it has.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
A few holes.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Like I'll give you an example in a minute.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
This.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
This.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The cup actually has a hole.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Here.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I put a hole in this place.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
How to get the data.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
How to define it.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
How to define.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Find a way to describe it.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And then describe it.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
You have to find out how many holes it has.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So that we can distinguish these data.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What's the difference?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
For example, like.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Um, for example, I know.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Um.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Um, this is a.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
This is a paper, and then he is.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Um, when the U.S. presidential election.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Um, in.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Some small bacteria in each state.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And then they might.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Different bacteria, he might vote red.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Or blue.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Can I use it?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Topology.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Find out.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Is there any.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Special structure is, for example, a blue sea.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
In fact, there may be some red bacteria.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Um, especially like.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Vote for the Republican Party.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Then, or just analyze this.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Um.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
All the papers that make up this data.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
What shape is there?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Um, yes.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Um.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
If you are interested in this TDA.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You can go to this website.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
He has a lot of.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Talk is the same as Tyra.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Um, invite people to share.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
After sharing, put it on YouTube.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Then you can see all kinds of.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Using TDA to study.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Some strange data examples.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
The example I'm talking about here.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You can find it in this paper.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Reference.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Um, other than this.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Topology is related to.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Um, put.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
The kind of picture I just said.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
The phenomenon that happened above.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Because of the picture.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Um, it's a pairwise.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Then extend to.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Um.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Not just pairwise, but three or four or more.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
That.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Um, he will have some examples.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I can't.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
In a very short time.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Finished.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
That is to say, what interesting examples do they have?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But most of the time.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Um.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
In the past, in the world of graph.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
He will have some dynamical models.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
For example.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
For example, there are two agents.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
When they are together.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
What kind of interaction?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
For example.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
For example, I want to buy a watch.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Then, but I'm not sure what brand I want to buy.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Then every time I look at my friends.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
What brand of watch do they wear?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Then decide.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
It's a majority vote.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
To decide what brand I should buy.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
This.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This is a model.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The main.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
The main component is.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Uh, you have to look at your friends.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
That's the effect between the two.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
There are a lot of these two.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
The model of the effect between the two.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Extended to.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Uh.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
More than two.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The effect.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Then there will be some interesting phenomena.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
So, um, this is.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Um, there are some related papers.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It's all about this data.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Okay.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Back to my original topic.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I just introduced.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I just introduced the degree and size.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Sequence.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Um, these two things are used to.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Describe a.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Symbiotic complex structure.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So why do we.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm interested in them.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Uh, because these things are.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's all very local.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
That is.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
For example, I want to go back.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Can I come back here?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
It's all a local structure.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That is.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't have to know all of me.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
What does all the data look like?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I just need to know.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
This person has several.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Several changes.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Or say.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
A group of three people.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
This is a local structure.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Then, um.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We're interested in them.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's because of these local structures.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Maybe with them.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
To do one thing together.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
There's a relationship.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So we want to put them together.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Establish a link.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That, um.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
What about this thing?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Because I often want to compare.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm in the world of Symbiotic Complex.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Then in the world of graph.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Uh, everyone is like this.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Asking questions.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Um, in the world of graph.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
There's a model called Configuration Model.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
What does that mean?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Um, I gave you a graph today.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Then I know this graph.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Inside the degree sequence.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
It's just telling me.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Every point he has a few.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
A few neighbors.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
This degree sequence.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
It's a very local one.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
That's it.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Sometimes, this network, he might have some.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
He might have some properties.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Yes, I'm not sure how special he is.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Or is it that he's with this?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
The local degree has a lot to do with it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So, I can use.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Configuration Model.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
This network.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Randomization is randomizing a lot.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
A lot of different networks.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
But, uh, I ask for these different networks.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Their degree sequence is all with me.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
The one I observed was the same.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Then I'll ask again.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Uh, in all the different networks.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The nature I care about.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
The distribution of the data I'm actually observing.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Uh, actually observing the data.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Is there any difference in this value?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
What if there's a difference?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I think so.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Um, this one.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The network I observed may be in this degree.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Um, there may be some special places.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Beyond the degree sequence.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Special places.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Um, need to be explained.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
This is an example.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It's like this.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
It is.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Um, this is a barn spiral.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
A bird.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And then, um, everyone thinks.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The color of it.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
With it.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
The ratio of the mating.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
There is a relationship, but everyone is not sure.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
What is the relationship?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Um, they do experiments.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Put this bird on top of the sensor.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Then look at the bird in a space.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Then fly.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
If they are close, he will connect a side.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Then form a network like this.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Well, in this network.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
They went to say.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Because he knows the color of each bird.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Then he also knows the different colors.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Is there any interaction between them?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So they just made this network.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
They will count them.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The one between them.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Correlation related to color.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Then I got this.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
This virtual line, this part.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
At the same time.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Um.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
This piece of paper also took this data.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Um, they observed this network.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Random.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Then every random component.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Calculated this once.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Pearson Correlation.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Then get a distribution.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Then so, um.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So this one comes from this data.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Observed.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Then this one comes from this distribution.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Um, you are random.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Then you will feel.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Ah, they actually.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Ah, there is no difference.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Ah, you won't feel.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So it seems to be here.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You won't feel that you are.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Color Color Correlation.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
What's special about it?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's more than the degree.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Degrees can explain.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Corresponding.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
If I observe another data.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
He may.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Um, his Correlation is very low.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
For example, if I don't know.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Um, if there is another data.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Then you observe his color.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Then you will ask.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Ah, you will feel.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Ah, why do I observe the data now?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
With this one.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
After this data.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
His Correlation is particularly low.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Then because of this randomization.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Is related to the degree.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You will know.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
At this time, there should be some.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Is beyond the degree.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Things beyond the degree.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Plays in this.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Then we.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Um.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Is there a problem so far?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Let me ask.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I want to understand this example.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Um.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
The picture in the middle.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
The number on it is.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
How many lines did he connect?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Or what?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The number on it should be his.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
The number of the bird.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Oh, the number of the bird.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Then.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
There should be a few times of interaction.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
OK.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Then.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
The meaning of gray and white.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Is their color.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Um.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
OK.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Then the picture on the right is.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
How did it come out?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I don't understand. Can you say it again?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
After we observe this map.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
After we observe this map.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
We also have his color.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
So we can actually count his.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Color color correlation.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Then we calculate a number.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
But I don't know if this number is.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Is it special?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
So.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Um.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
They said.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Let me see if I can put this network.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I found a lot.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Ah.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
With him.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
The structure is different.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
But the degree sequence is the same as other networks.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And then on top of it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Calculate his.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Correlation.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And then we got a distribution.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And then we can ask.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
In the end, I observed this data.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Correlation.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Is it special?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
OK.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Um.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Then is this more special?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Is.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Ah.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's with me.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
How do I put this network?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It's about randomization.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
At this time, he fixed his.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
His degree.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Is.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Fixed him every.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Every bird.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
In the end, with a few other birds.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And then there are a lot of other different structures.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And then ask.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I observed this.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Is it special?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
So.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
The middle of this example.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Anyway.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Doing this thing.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Your.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
It means.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You have to find.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
The same degree sequence.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
This thing.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
The thing that needs to be studied.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Is this the conclusion?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Correct.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Ah.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This paper is.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Proposed a configuration model.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You can randomize a network.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And then he gave an example.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Ah.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
After you can randomize it.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Ah.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
This ensemble can be used to do.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Some statistical tests.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
OK.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So, uh.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
So if you only look at this piece of paper.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
You might only get a Pearson correlation.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And then, but you don't really know.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
What's so special about him?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So, in order to know his special place.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I want to put the original data.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Ah.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Fixed a few parameters.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And then make an ensemble.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
And then let's take a look at this ensemble.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
All of the.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Inside the Pearson correlation.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Is not.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Ah.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
In fact, it depends on.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I suspect he's with.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
What kind of parameters do I suspect he's related to?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
For example, now I suspect.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
This Pearson correlation may be related to.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
The degree distribution.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It may be related to the degree distribution.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
So I deliberately fixed it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Let's take a look at this distribution.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And then see if he's in there or out there.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Any other questions?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Ah.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Then I.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Ah.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Ah.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Ah.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Ah.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Ah.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Ah.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Ah.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Ah.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Ah.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Ah.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Ah.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Well, that's the example of the bird just now.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
How many other birds do the birds have?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Interaction.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
The Global Gravity of Opportunity.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That's a paper by The Biological Science.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Its reproduction is likely to be related to the color.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
This is one.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
A global.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
It may be related to a local.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
An example in a certain data.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
That ah.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Another related question.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
If I.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Only after getting.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
After the degree sequence.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Can I get from it.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Generate a network.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
If I can.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
In fact, it can also be used to answer a lot of interesting questions.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
They are on the structure.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And in.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
In.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Is dynamic.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
For example.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Ah.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Ah.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I think this is more.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Domain specific.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm going to click on it again.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
This.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
This link.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
But here.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
What I want to say is.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Well.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Ah.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Everyone will doubt that a.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Everyone will doubt that.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Can I.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
From a local information.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And this structure.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Is there anything special about it?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
If you can't generate it.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
If I get a degree sequence.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I don't know how to generate a network.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Then you can't talk about it at all.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
On this network.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
What kind of structure is special.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So being able to build this link is an important thing.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Then this is the structure.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Then the second dynamic.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
What does it mean?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Ah.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Take that.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I'm not an infectious disease expert.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
But in terms of infectious disease cases.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Ah.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Because we know that infectious diseases sometimes spread very quickly.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It's because some people may.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Ah.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
There is a chance in everyday life.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Hundreds of people.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
But this is not our normal life.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But in the data of this human network.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
There are specific people.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
His degree is very large.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
That.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
In such a data.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
In such a structure.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
We have to be able to generate this structure.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
To answer this question.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So we.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
There will be a model.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Say it.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
If I want to generate a network.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Then this network.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
The distribution of the degree is very heavy.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That is.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
You look at his.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You draw a distribution.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Ah.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
There are only a few friends in life.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Then there are a few people with two friends.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
There are thousands of friends in life.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
This is a degree distribution.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
That.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
You have to generate a structure from this distribution.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Then you can be on top of that structure.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Run the model of infectious diseases on that structure.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That's why.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Be able to have a way.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
From local information to generate a structure.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It is also important because.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Ah.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
In this way, you can do some experiments.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Ah.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
So this is what I provide.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
About what I'm going to do.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
That.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Ah.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Go deeper into the topic.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Ah.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Ah, we just talked about this.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
The local thing is the degree.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Then we have.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Observe some data.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Usually, after you observe the data.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Ah, you have to get the degree.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
It's very simple.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
For example, you know you.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You have a class.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Then you go to ask everyone he has.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You think in this class.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
What kind of people are his friends?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Then you will get one.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The network of friends in this class.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Then you have to go from this network of friends to get it.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
His degree is actually very simple.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Just take everyone.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And then see how many friends he has around him.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
That's it.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
This direction is usually simpler.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
That.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But it's more difficult.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
How do you.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Every friend, for example, this class has 30 people.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Then you give me one.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Ah, you give me 30 numbers greater than 0.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Then you can not create a network.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
This is more difficult to ask.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Correspondence is.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
If you want to get this network.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
You have to randomize it.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Find an ensemble.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
So that every network in this ensemble.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
He has the same.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Degree sequence.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
This thing is also a difficult thing.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
What I listed is everyone's work.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Then you can click to see.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
That's a little closer.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
That is.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
You get a simple complex.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
How to randomize it.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So that every one in this randomization.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Ah, every one.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Simple complex.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
They all have the same.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Degree and size sequence.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
That this.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Ypvp17.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Ah, just now.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Ah, the one that inspired me.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
That.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Why is this a problem?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Ah, the same thing is in the hypergraph.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
That's how it appears.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Why?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Why would I do this job?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
The reason is because.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They are in this paper.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
They proposed a.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Randomize a structure.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Then they go.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Explain that they are like this.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Can.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Can.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Explore.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
All possible space.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
He has some mathematical arguments in it.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
But.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
What about this method? He has to have one.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
A data is there.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Then you can put that data.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That's it.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But he can't answer.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Some questions like today.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I want to have one.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Theoretical.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Ah.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Degree and size sequence.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Ah, I want to know.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
For example, my degree and size sequence.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
They are all the ones I just said.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That kind of structure.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Can I use it?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
To generate a.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
A data.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And then randomize it.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
If there is no.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It's not easy for me to do it.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
They can only go.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Ah.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
This.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
To find a data.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And then randomize it.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
So, my job is a.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
A work.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I want to ask a question.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I still don't quite understand.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Ah.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Randomization and this one.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Find one.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
One.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
But the first question is.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You have a.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
A degree sequence.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Then can you find a picture.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Ah.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
This degree sequence.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Is this the place where you draw the green line?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Is it?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
If it's just a picture, it should be this place.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Oh, sorry.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Find a.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Complex data.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
If it's a complex data.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
That's where I'm green.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You just need to find one?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Or you just.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
You just need to find one.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
The reason is that after I found this.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I can use the method here to randomize it.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
It's useful in statistics.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
OK.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
But what's the difference between randomization and this thing?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
My understanding is.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Randomization, you don't have to.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
From.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You give a.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Then you already know the degree.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Degree sequence.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
You are from degree sequence to.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Randomization.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You have to find.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You have to find a lot of pictures.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Is that what it means?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Ah.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
If it's.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
These random algorithms.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
If it can be used, it must have a structure.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
If you only give me.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Two integer series.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I can't go.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
For example, to swap his.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
His side.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Then to change his structure.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So this randomization process is.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You have to give a structure first.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Then he might do some swap.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
What is it?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Turn it into.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
The same degree picture.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
The so-called structure is.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Like.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Like this kind of thing.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I have to give me a structure first.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Then I can use.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Random algorithm.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Usually related to.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Swap side.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
For example, swap two sides.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Swap at the same time.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Keep their degree unchanged.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But if you don't.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
If you don't have such a structure.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You can't do it.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
These things here.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
So the green line is equal to.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I'm going to find the first one.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Then we can start randomization.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
OK.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Thank you.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
That's great.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't think I have enough time.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I'm going to talk faster.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But I might skip some slides.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I still hope I can.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I'll be done in about an hour.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
To do this thing.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
In fact, I didn't.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Solve all the problems.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
The reason is because.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
What about this question?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
He was proven to be a.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
NP complete question.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And then if you're doing research.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I usually tell you.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You can't actually find one.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
The algorithm is.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It can be completely.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Effective and useful.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
That's a shame.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
But at that time.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I thought it was interesting.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Oh, by the way.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That's the thing.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Test two integer series.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Can you find one?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
This thing should be.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
A difficult problem.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I think the interesting thing is.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I was really going to draw a picture.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
It's like doing that reading.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That's it.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
In the end, I used Excel to do research.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
That's it.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
This is the problem.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
For example, I give two integer series.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
One is 43321.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
This is his.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
The series of degrees is here.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
And then I give another integer series.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
It's called his size series.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It's called 33333.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Well, my goal is.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
In this array.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Fill in 0 or 1.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
So that his.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Every column is just right.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's 4.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
This is just 3.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Every row is just right.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
It's 3.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
In addition to this, there is another one.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Make this a problem.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
One of the difficult conditions.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
It's a difficult limitation.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
It's two.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They can't.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Can't.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
One of them is another.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
This thing.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
This is from what I just said.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Simple complex definition.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I hope I'm here.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
These structures that show up here.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
It's already the biggest.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Simple complex is those facets.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That's it.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
So if I put 111 here.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
But here, I still want to fill in 111.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
If you fill in 111.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
This 111 is with the following 111.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Is each other.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Uh.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
One of them is another subset.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Or vice versa.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I can't fill in 111 here.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
So this time I can only fill in 111.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Then jump one to become one.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
So these two won't be each other.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Subset.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Suppose.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
In this line, I only need to fill in two 1s.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I can't fill in, for example, 111.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Because this 111.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It's going to be wrapped up in this 111.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
So at that time, I tried a lot of this.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Fill in 1.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Fill in 1 and 0.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And then add it up and see if you can add it.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Uh, they gave this number.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
That's what I just said.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
The limitation is to make this problem difficult.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
But I found some examples.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
It's actually very simple.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
For example, uh, if I'm here.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
All of this.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
If the input degree is all 1.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Then there are here.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Uh, 15.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So I'm going to have 15 1s here.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Then I can do this.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
111.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Then jump one to become 111.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Then jump another 111.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Then I can easily create one.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
A structure is in line with what I just said.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
That one.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Degree size sequence.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
So, uh.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
My.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
What about this job?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I thought of one.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
The algorithm is a heuristic.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Uh, in computer science.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
The meaning of the heuristic is that you have one.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You have a rule.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Uh, every step of your algorithm.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
You have to go.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The rules are very local.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
But.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Uh.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
It's very surprising that you can use this rule.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
This is a heuristic.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
There is no way to guarantee that it is the best.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
But it can also be used.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Then we found that.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Um, most of the.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Input sequence.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I can use the algorithm that I will talk about later.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
To find an instance.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Yes, that's what I just said.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Add a key.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Um.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
This thing on both sides of the input.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Good.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
After I finish this algorithm.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I will skip some slides.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Then talk about mine.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I think it's an interesting interlude.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Then I will wrap up at the end.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
This is my algorithm.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Of course I won't talk about this algorithm.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
But, uh, his.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
The idea is probably like this.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Uh, I want to try all the possible 0s and 1s.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But when I try it.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I don't want to try it randomly.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I hope that when I first started.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
My input.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I arranged it from large to small.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
4333321

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Then this other size input.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I also arranged it in large and small.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
After arranging it.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I started from the top down.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Fill in 1 or 0.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
But when I fill it in.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I want to say.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
This degree is big.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Hurry up and get together.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It becomes a simplex.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
So I'm going to start from the left.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Slowly fill in the lower right corner.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So every time I fill it in.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I have a rule.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I want to.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Get together first.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
That, uh.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
When arranging.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I can also be sure.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Oh, by the way, this is a.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Um, this is a recursive algorithm.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I see a wild here.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Then, uh, I have some conditions.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
In it.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Every time I fill in this 0 and 1.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Sometimes I can figure it out.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Sometimes I can know.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Is it wrong for me to fill in 0 and 1 like this?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
For example.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
For example, let's say I'm here.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I'm done here.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
And then there's a 1 here.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And then, uh, here, uh.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Fill in another 1.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Then there's no way to fill in 1 here.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Because I already have four 1s here.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Then add it up and it's 4.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
So if I fill in 1 here.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I'll be over 4.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Then I don't have to try this.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
This is the condition of 1.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
If it's in this line.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
So, in fact, every line is filled in.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Uh, don't go any further.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Some of the conditions I can know.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
And then I can delete this option.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And then, so he's actually a little bit.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Stupid way.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I really want to put all the possibilities.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
All found.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's just that when I'm looking for this possibility.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I have a specific sequence.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And then, uh.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
The interesting thing about this study is that this specific sequence.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
It's.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
It's useful.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
That.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
We also have some in there.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Uh, for example, I.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I fill in one and then I.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Finally, I found that this road is different.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I will, uh, record that.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Ah, this road is different. I have a rejection.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Then if there are too many rejections, then I will give up.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Because I know this question is very difficult.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And then I don't want to.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Find all the possibilities.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
That, uh.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Then I.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Uh, I'm going to do this part.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
This part is what I'm going to do.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
To do the test is what I hope.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I can find.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
All add up to 13.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
This whole series of all kinds.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
So this is actually 101.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Add up to 101.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Add up to 13.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
The whole series.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And then I'm 101 times 101.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
All the possibilities.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
And then I want to run.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Uh, the algorithm I just mentioned.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Will he get it?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
A simple show is to get a simplex.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
As his output.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Or did I finally give up?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
That, uh.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
What about here?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
What I want to say is.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
In fact, most of the.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Because, uh, here's a set.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm calculating how much time I spend.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And then my definition of time is how many times I have.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It's backwards.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Uh, I was.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And then sometimes I might be in a certain meat.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I found no way.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I'm going to backtrack again.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Backtrack number.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Uh, the number I was rejected.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I was rejected.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Some very simple rules.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And then I found this road is different.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Most of them are white.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Or this gray.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
So in fact, most of the.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Most of the input is simple.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
So here I'm going to say.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
In fact, most of the input is simple.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Ah, this one, I'm going to.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Jump over a little faster.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
But this one is mainly about.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Well, this thing.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Uh, you can scale up.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
To, uh.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Add up to 1,000.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
This kind of, uh.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Simple complex.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
It was just added to 13.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Now add up to 1,000.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Um, I can still.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Find it very quickly.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Some of the inside that.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Is it simple?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Uh.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
With the time I spent doing this.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
So.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And then I found that most of the.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
The time it takes.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
It's pretty rare.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
It's within the time of the polynomial.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
That's why I'm here.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
The next conclusion is.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Hey, this method is a useful method.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I can, uh, take it.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Uh, random input.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I can use it to find a structure.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I might need to give up some.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Because I can't make sure.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
What did I miss?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Because the problem itself is difficult.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
But, uh, if I have a large number.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I can still use it to do something.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Useful statistical things.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Okay, and then, um.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
With just.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
So, um.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
The progress of this paper is to say.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Uh, because I just said.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Uh, I'm looking for this.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
When it comes to structure, I hope.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Uh, those big friends.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
You have to get together first.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So, uh, is there anything special about this?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Some structures were found by me.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
So, uh, I'm going to calculate.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Um, this.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
There are a few holes in the structure.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So, this is a.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
In that topological data analysis.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
One of the standard methods.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
If I have a complex.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I can ask him how many holes he has.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
So.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
That's a hole like this.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
In the middle.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
So, um.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
If this hole is the number of this hole.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
It's a kind of thing.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
It's called Betty Numbers.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And then he'll have all kinds of different.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Dimensional holes, for example.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Um.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Betty Zero is.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
He has a few.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
There are two.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
He only has one.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
But he happens to have a hole.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
So his Betty One is one.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And then Betty Zero is one.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
H2 is a higher-level hole.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And so on.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
it is good.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Start with love.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This is the second one.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Because this is just to say.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
What I just said.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Um, that kind of heuristic.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
There are really some special structures.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Is.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Created by me.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
There is nothing.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It's not very scientific.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
But he is.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
One of the features of this algorithm.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
This feature will help us find it.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Um, very scattered.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
With very few holes.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
This kind of structure.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
That, um.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
What about the focus?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It's not what this structure looks like.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
But I can.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
To build a bridge is from.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Input.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Find a structure.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And then I want to use someone else.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Randomize the method to find an ensemble.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And then answer some questions.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So this is just doing some.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Capitalization is about me.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Some features of the algorithm.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Okay, and then.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
This is not an interlude.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
That is to say, why do you have to count?

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Because, uh, sometimes.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
In fact, it is important to know how many holes there are in this data.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Take the one I just said.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Uh, in terms of the example of the brain area.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Uh, you can actually know that.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Uh, normal people's brains.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
In some specific structure.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
The number of holes.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
With.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Uh, there are.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Um, external dropout.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
A kind of neurological disease.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
The structure of the brain.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
These two.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The number of holes will be different.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
This is a.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Uh, there are a few holes.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Um, it might be useful.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Um, the other place that might be useful.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Um, uh, it is.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Uh, uh, it is.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Um, signal processing.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Signal processing.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Um.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
This thing is.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
To say, let's say a.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Data, this data.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I observed these.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
On a network.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This is all this gray.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
It's all a network, and then.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
All this is colored is the data I observed.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Then, in this data.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Because I am very clear now.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I see all the data.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I know there are two holes in this data.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Then, um, these two holes.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
In the structure is very special.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
But I observed this.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
This one with color, this arrow.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I don't know what it is.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Uh, what does it have to do with this hole?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
That, uh, there is a way.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
That is, I can put.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
These observed arrows.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Projected to.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Two holes above.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
This is a bit like that.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
The PCA that everyone learns statistics.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Because PCA will have two.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I can put it.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Projected up, and then look at it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
These two different directions.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Um, the information is not.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The biggest explanation.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Uh, the data I observed.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Then, if you put this data projected up.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You will find that, uh, these three have color lines.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Be grouped together.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Then the other three groups together.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Then the other three groups together.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Why are they grouped together?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Because of any.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
In a group of lines, he has no way.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Don't skip this hole.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Deform to the side.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
For example, I fix these two ends.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Then I want to pull this rope.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I can't get around this hole.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I can only be in this place.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Just squeeze together.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Yeah, so, um, this is one.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Can be from, uh.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
You can get some from your data.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Some of the things that are related to the collection.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
How to do things like this.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Then, um, this is.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
A.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
A small field called.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Signal processing.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Then I list some articles.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You can find some interesting examples in it.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
That, um.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Finally, this video.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I'm going to skip it all.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
What about this video?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
It's about, um.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
We if we.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
If we limit our world.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
It's a network.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
If we can only see the network, then we.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
We care about some of this network.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Um.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
It's the number of holes.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
So.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Uh, we.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
And then we have some options.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
For example, if this network is getting more and more dense.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
In fact, we will feel that this hole will be more and more.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Because it's a network that's getting denser and denser.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
So his circle.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
His hole is getting more and more.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Um, but this intuition can't be.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Completely carried out.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Uh, in the complex, because.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Uh, because of the one I just said.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
The limit of the complex.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
So, um.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
His.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
His.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
The description I just said just came back.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
If it's a denser and denser complex.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
His hole is actually getting less and less.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
There are some of this.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Uh, some interesting things about the structure.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Interesting things.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Okay, so this is my final slide.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Um.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I think the most important piece of information is that we are now.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Uh, with this.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I developed this method.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
It can be used.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
For arbitrary degree size sequence.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I can use it to find a structure.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Then I can use it at this time.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Uh, someone else's.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Uh, random method, random network.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Then you can ask some statistical questions.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
What about the second interesting thing?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Um, what I just said.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Uh, this computer science question.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
He has a feature called.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
This means.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Uh, if you go to Google.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
MPCompany will be on his.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Wikipedia to find this picture.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
In fact, the world in here.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
It's still very rich.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Maybe it's simple and difficult.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
So he is.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Uh.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Uh, I have.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
That algorithm is written as a.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Python package.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Just open a terminal.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
You can use this algorithm directly.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
What about the last one?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I think this job has.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Uh.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
There are some problems.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
That's what I just said.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
In fact, it should be.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
In general, it's a difficult question.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Why is there a.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Simple algorithm can.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Count to the inside.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Most of them can be solved.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
So why is he so successful?

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Um.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I haven't been able to.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Uh, answer this question.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
What about the rest of the statistics?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Yes, I can ask.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Um, if I.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
See a data, I can think about it.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Um, this data is related to it.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
After a few fixed parameters.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Randomized data.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Uh, what's the difference? Why is my data.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
May be with.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Uh, I think it should be.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Uh.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
It should be some.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Um, parameters.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I'm sorry.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Um, I'm in this data.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I have observed some.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I think it's interesting.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Uh, I hope to know.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Um.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Is it really interesting?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
So in order to know this.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I need to randomize some parts.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
That's a statistic.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Uh.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's a long question.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Well, uh, a little bit more.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Because, uh.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
This is a complex system.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
A related one.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
A question.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
In the complex system, we usually have some components.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
That's his agent.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Uh, the local structure I just said.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
For example, I choose what kind of friends I want to make.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
This is a choice I made.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
But I'm the last.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Uh, the human society is a global thing.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
That's it.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Is there any data?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Uh, we can ask.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Uh, the link between local and global.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Okay.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Um.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This is my list.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Uh, I think it's useful.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
And then, because today's topic is.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Uh.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Related to the higher order network.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
So these articles are all with, uh.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
It's just some technical survey.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
And then, uh.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I just talked about some data.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
How to calculate the structure of this data.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Uh, there are three useful.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Uh, link for reference.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That, uh.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Uh, I think this area is.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Network science field.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And then, um, he has some communities.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
For example, this net size is every year.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
A meeting will be held.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That, uh.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm in this.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Um.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Since.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
In this organization.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And then, um, they're every year.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Uh, we'll be here every year.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Some activities.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That, uh, we have a slack.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
If you're interested in joining, you can.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Write an email to me.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
It's useful.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
The other thing is, um.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
There is a seminar.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That, um.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Like Tara.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
There will be some.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
With network science.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Talk.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
That corresponds to this diversified.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Net size symposium.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Okay.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm done.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Thank you.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Thank you.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Then we can turn on the microphone.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Applause.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Ok.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Uh, is there a problem with the audience here?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Uh.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Uh, I have a question here.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I don't know if I can ask.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Um, please ask.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Let me turn on the microphone.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Uh, the organizer.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Then, how are you? I am.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Li Xuanwei from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I heard the speech last time.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It was two years ago.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Then it's still exciting.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Thank you for sharing.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Because we have a topic.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
There are also related research.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So I heard this.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I feel very excited to see if I can use it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Our own research.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Then, uh, there are a few questions.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I want to ask Zixi.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
There are about three.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The first one is.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Uh, we.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
On the actual data.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Uh, there are a lot of different.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Uh.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Different types, like your node.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
There are different types of nodes.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Like gender, male, female, race.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Black, white, Asian.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Like this is a note type.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That edge is also edge.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Then you can add different weight.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You can be 01.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You can also be a variety of numbers.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Or.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Uh, a few kinds of 0.51.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
0123.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Or you can be a sign.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Different edge.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Then your edge can also be directional.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
You can point to different places.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
That's what you're using now.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
This algorithm.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Have you ever thought that you can promote it in the future?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Different nodes or edge types.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I don't know if this is in the complex.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Will it be an extension?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
An important extension.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
This is the first question.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The second question is, um.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I'm curious.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
This algorithm.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's you give a sequence.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
With, uh.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Uh, another one.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I forgot the name, but you give two sequences.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
You can push it all.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Uh, a possible picture.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Even the future method can be calculated.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That if I give you today.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Is a part of the information.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Assuming I take my class.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'm going to do a comparison of the data.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I have a class.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
30 students.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Suppose only 10 students fill this information.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Then we assume that the information he filled is complete.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That I can use your method.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Calculate these 10 people.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Among the data given.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
This may be behind you.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Maybe you didn't handle this article.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But a question behind it.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Your opinion is.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Take the data of these 10 people to restore the whole 30 people.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The ensemble on the board.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Then the credibility of this.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Is it worth doing this?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I don't really know.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
This is the second one.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
If you only get part of the observation information.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Can you guess the whole group?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Interaction.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
What is the interaction of various high-level low-level?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The last question is.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You finally mentioned that.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Like persistent homology.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Indeed, in this field.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Development is very fast.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
When we do social studies.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There will also be different holes.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You just said those holes.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
We want to say that it is a high-level interaction.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In social studies, there is a hole called structural hole.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Structural hole is to say.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Between two groups.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
It may not be so close.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
There will be some key loopholes.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
The two are more.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
How to have a connected group.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Connected together.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I don't know if it's your observation.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Or your feeling.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
These two holes.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
One is from homology.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The hole of homology.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
With social science.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
On the graph.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Called structural hole.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Is it possible to have something to do with it?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Because you just said.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The conclusion is not necessarily the conclusion of homology.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
The denser the picture, the less.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I always want to say these two.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I actually didn't think it through.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
This is a very wonderful speech.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Thank you.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That was my three-year question.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Thank you.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
First of all.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I want to say.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I think now.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Because these studies.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Are all based on data.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I want to have a data.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Then come and ask me.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
The data is quite small.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Then.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
There are more pictures.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So, in fact, there are some.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
The study is how.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
From one.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Observe the data in the picture.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Go.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Do statistics.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
In fact.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
For example, three people.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
They are all connected to each other.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
In fact, we express it as.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Three sides.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Three sides.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
No than.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
They are expressed as one.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
A hyper edge.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's still coming.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's effective in statistics.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So there's a lot of this.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
How from one.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Infer high order structure.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
The question.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So you just said.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You just said the question.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I want to refresh.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The second one is.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It's related to.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That is.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Can extend.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I just said this.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Configuration model work.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And then today.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
If I have a data.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
He.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
There may be nodes.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
For example, human network data nodes may have.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Racial and income and so on.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And then I'm going to fix it.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And then to generate an ensemble.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I do not know.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
But I will.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
All these questions I will go back.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Look at the graph.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I have no impression of the graph.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But I think.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It seems to be a very good starting point.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Because he.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Because he.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It can help us answer.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Other statistical issues.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
We can.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That offline.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
You can talk about this.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Then the second question is.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
With.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In fact, the first two questions.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I do not know.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
The second question is today.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Say I have one.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I have a class of 50 people.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Then, of course, from.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I'm talking about this algorithm.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I can put it.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Randomization.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Randomization.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Every one.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You can take it as a statistical value.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
To get a distribution.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
But if I can only observe.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Part of the people in these 50.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
How do I get from.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
This part of the inside.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Get the most information.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
In fact, I should have this distribution.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Get the most information.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I also think it is a very good research question.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I do not know.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And I think the two questions I just said.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
In.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
On the graph.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I do not seem to have seen such a job.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Just on the graph.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
That.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
That.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
The third question.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It may be easier to answer.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Is.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
So.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Uh, I sound like that.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's more like a set.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
A defined definition, right?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Uh, if that's the case.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Uh, because in.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Topology inside.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Topology.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
This thing.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Um, he is.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
There is a clear.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
One of the.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Um.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's technical.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I'm going to take this data.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Divided into different dimensions.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And then this dimension forms a circle complex.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And then the circle complex inside.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Different dimensions.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The so-called.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Boundary map link.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And then the boundary map is going to form some properties.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
For example.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It must be zero.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That's it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Because of a mathematical property like this.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Uh, I can do it inside.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
To calculate the hole.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So, um.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So if it's a.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
If it's a social network.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And then I'm going to ask.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
The hole on it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Um.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
What's the connection?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I, I, I think.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Um.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't think it's possible to answer this question just by looking at the structure.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Because of your structure.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
The definition of the hole is already.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Contains some.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Tributes related to nodes.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
For example, who is.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The most influential of the two groups.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But if it's.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Uh, topology.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It's all about math.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You tell me.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
What's the structure like?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Triangles filled with triangles.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
There are a few filled with two sides.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So, and then calculate.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
So.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
The topology.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The hole in the topology.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It's all about the structure.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And then it might be with.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Um.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Related to sociology.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Structural hole is related.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
It may not be related.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Thank you.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I hope I answered.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, I might be offline.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Ask something that we are interested in.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Show you again.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Thank you.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Do you have any questions?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Can I ask a question myself?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Just.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You just proposed a heuristic.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The algorithm.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Then.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
In my opinion.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Because I'm not.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm not familiar with this at all.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
In my opinion.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Your algorithm looks like.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
If there is a solution.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
If this algorithm finds a solution.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Then you are successful.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
But in the picture you just showed.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It has those.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
How did you do that?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Just.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
My.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It looks like your algorithm.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I haven't finished all the calculations.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
How do you know there is no solution?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Um.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
This is a good question.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I skipped it because I was in a hurry.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Uh, because I know I can't.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I can't.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Explore all possibilities.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So I have set a cutoff.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Then.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
If the number of failures is greater than the cutoff.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I said there was no solution.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
But maybe I'll be more serious.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
There will be a solution.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
If I wait long enough, there will be a solution.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Yes, but on your picture.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
The part that is not solved.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Isn't it white?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Isn't the white part?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Oh.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
The reason is because that picture.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Is a very small example.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So in that example.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Basically I have all.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
All explored.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
All explored.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But my question is.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Your claim is.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
More than 80% of the.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The problem will be solved.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
But.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But in my opinion.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
It seems that the white part is more than the other parts.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Isn't that just the case?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
My claim.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
My claim is.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
In this larger network.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Is 80%.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
OK.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But the example you just showed.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
The network is too small.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Then the example I just showed.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
In fact, it may also be 80%.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
But it's just looking up here.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Then.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
If there is a solution, it must be.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
If there is a solution, it must be.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Oh.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Um.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
This is the part I didn't talk about.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Um.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Because I.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If this is too large.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I will have a lot of possibilities.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I need to find.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
So in this.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I chose a number.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Then I randomly.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
In all possibilities.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
After choosing this number.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Then this.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I figured out the number.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
The ratio.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Then just.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The one I just said.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The example that adds up to 13.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's probably from here.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So in other words.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You would expect to say.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Um.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You would expect to say probably.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Is less than.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
0.01.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
After you choose a size.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Then you will feel all the possibilities.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
That's the one.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Add up to that size.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
In those possibilities.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's probably 0.01.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Find a simplicial.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
OK.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Then we.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
We say he is.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
The method.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There are two.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
One is that he has some obvious reasons.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I was rejected.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think he won't have a simplicial possibility.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
For example.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
For example.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
My.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
For example.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It's all 3 here.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Add up to 15.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But I only have 15 here.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Or for example.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Add up to 15.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
For example, here is 7.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Then here is 8.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Here is 8.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Then here is 7.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But this is 8.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Then I was rejected.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Is non-simplicial.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
There are many parts.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's a very simple reason.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Then.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
There are quite a lot of parts.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I set the cutoff.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I gave up over time.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Another question is.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
My other question is.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
You later.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Said your.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Turistic algorithm.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
He.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Usually find less holes.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Structure.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Will this cause.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
After that.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Randomize.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Are you biased towards a certain structure?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You may not be completely.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Randomize your picture.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I think this is also a very good question.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Then.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
They.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
They did.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This randomization.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
When this work.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It's already in his paper.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Explain that he thinks.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
They do this.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Randomization.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Explore this space.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
It's all connected.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So you can find it all.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
That.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So this should not be a problem.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Then I do it myself.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
The test did not feel.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I think.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I can't find a data.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Then from different starting points.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Then see if he is.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Different space.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It feels like it's all converged.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So this is a reasonable question.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Then we.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I have no evidence to say.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It will be different.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So I think.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It's good to find one.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
The meaning of the so-called ergotic.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Say.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
All possible.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
All possible.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Those structures.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
In.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
After some kind of transformation.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It will become another.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
The same thing.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Then.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But it can make a whole circle.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
All possible structures.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Are interconnected.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
The way to connect is in that kind of swap.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
This thing.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Will not let all possible.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
This instance.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Split in half.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
OK.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
So use his method.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
All.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
All possible structures will be connected.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So you run slowly.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
You will run across the entire network.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Correct.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But there are many problems here.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
That is.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It may take a long time to run slowly.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Correct.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Just like the ergotic of physics.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
This job is to provide a starting point.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Let people start from there.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Thank you.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Are there any questions here?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
OK.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
If not.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Thank you.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
The recording is turned off.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
OK.
