1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as well as gender and physiological gender research and digital culture research.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Her paper is The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
She is also a Collegiate University Teaching Fellow

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and a Professor of Engaging Gender Performances in East Asian Theater through Digital Storytelling at UCLA's Digital Humanities Program.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She is also the winner of the Professor's Prize in International Academy of Sciences.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She is also a Ph.D. student in the Department of Theater Studies at Taiwan University of the Arts and a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chinese Studies at Taiwan University of the Arts.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Today's topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's welcome Yang Yun-Pu.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you, everyone.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will now share my first video.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here it is.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think everyone can see it now.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate, so I am currently writing my paper.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This topic is one of my papers.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In today's presentation, I will divide it into two parts.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In the first part, I will briefly introduce Meng Xiaodong, her performance style, her personal life, and her marriage.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In the second part, I will focus on how the public views Meng Xiaodong.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will also talk about how the New York Times interpreted Meng Xiaodong from the 1920s to the 1950s.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Meng Xiaodong is a very special actress.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the U.S., sexual harassment, sexual violence, and death are all very sensitive topics.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, trigger warning.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Later, we will talk about topics related to sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual violence, and death.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Everyone should be mentally prepared.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is Meng Xiaodong, who I will introduce today.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Meng Xiaodong was born in 1908 and passed away in 1977.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If I remember correctly, she was born in Shanghai in 1908.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In 1977, she moved to Taiwan and settled down in Taiwan.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When she passed away, she was buried in a cemetery in Taipei.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I remember that someone on the Internet shared the location of the grave.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you are interested, you can go and take a look.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Meng Xiaodong is a very well-known female veteran in the entertainment industry.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A veteran is someone who plays a male role on stage.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are many types of male roles.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In short, a veteran is a mature male.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Meng Xiaodong is very famous for being a very good veteran.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We call female veterans.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There is a very important concept that I want to emphasize.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is easy to say that if a man plays a female role on stage or a woman plays a male role on stage,

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we generally say that this is a backstabbing.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But in the play, the meaning of backstabbing is not like this at all.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The meaning of backstabbing is that, for example, Meng Xiaodong has been a veteran since childhood.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
One day, he suddenly played a female role on stage.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is called backstabbing.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If he plays a male role on stage, this is called the job of the job.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The job is the job of the job in Japan.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The job is the job of the job in Japan.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So don't mix up the backstabbing concept of the stage with the backstabbing in the play.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Another example is Mei Lanfang.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mei Lanfang is a very famous veteran actor.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So when we talk about Mei Lanfang,

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we don't say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We say that Mei Lanfang uses her job to perform.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But if Mei Lanfang plays a man on stage today,

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we will say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I hope this part can be clarified.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Meng Xiaodong's very famous part,

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think it's still the best backstabbing woman in history.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You may ask what kind of backstabbing woman is backstabbing woman.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Backstabbing woman is Yu Shuyan.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yu Shuyan is the person in the middle.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She is the founder of backstabbing woman.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She was born in 1890 to 1943.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yu Shuyan has a very high status in the old generation.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
To this day, many Beijing opera actors

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
still say that they are learning from the Yu family.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They think she is a teacher of the Yu family.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They think she is a legend.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A legend that cannot be surpassed.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
People like Yu Shuyan are proud all their lives.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
She has only received two students.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We say that sometimes other young actors

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
may have learned one or two plays from her.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But they are not formal backstabbing women.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Formal backstabbing women are those who kowtow to her,

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
kneel down to her, and give her gifts.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All famous actors come to witness

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
this kind of formal backstabbing women.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We say that she is a real disciple.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She has received two real disciples in her life.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One male and one female.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The male is Li Shaochun, the one on the left.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He is also very famous.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The female is Meng Xiaodong.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Interestingly,

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
according to Chinese culture,

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
especially in the era of the Republic of China,

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
where men and women are very important,

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
or in the Qing Dynasty, where men and women were very important,

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it is very interesting that

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
people generally think that Meng Xiaodong

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is a person who has really been passed down by the Yu family.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because Li Shaochun was too busy.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Li Shaochun had a family to support.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So whoever asked him to act, he did.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Making money is the most important thing.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yu Shuyuan is a very serious person.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She is very...

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't think it's natural.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't teach you how to act.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You act as Sun Wukong every day.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Aren't you embarrassing me?

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Meng Xiaodong is different.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Meng Xiaodong,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we will talk about her marriage later.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Basically, when she studied with Yu Shuyuan,

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
she was single.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So she didn't have a family to support.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She also had more time

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to study with Yu Shuyuan.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So in the end, people actually think that

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the person who really

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
got Yu Shuyuan's love

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and was able to learn from Yu Shuyuan

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
was Meng Xiaodong,

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
not Li Shaochun.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We will also talk about Meng Xiaodong's marriage.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The one on the left

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is when Meng Xiaodong was 19

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and married Mei Lanfang.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The one on the right is Mei Lanfang.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So the existence of this

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
little phoenix

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
became a very interesting topic

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
for gossip magazines at the time.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They thought that

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the girl's eyes were female,

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and the man's eyes were male.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The relationship between

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the two sexes

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
made gossip magazines very popular.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
At that time, Mei Lanfang

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
was already a very famous star.

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A popular entertainment star.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But later,

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
she divorced Mei Lanfang

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
when she was

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
in her late thirties.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
She married another man,

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
an old man.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This old man may not look

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
very good,

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but don't think it's nothing.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Because this old man

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is actually a very famous

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
young man in Shanghai

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
from the 1920s to the 1950s.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
His name is Du Yuesheng.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In simple terms,

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Du Yuesheng is a very famous

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and high-ranking gangster.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Meng Xiaodong became his

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
fifth wife.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This photo

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
is of Meng Xiaodong

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
when he played the role of

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Qing Dingzhu.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Before we talk more

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
about Meng Xiaodong's story,

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I also hope to find

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
a small part of his

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
recording and let everyone

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
feel his singing.

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But this singing

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
is not a very formal

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
recording.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In the 1950s and 1960s,

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
he lived in Hong Kong for a while.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
When he lived in Hong Kong,

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
he recorded at home

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
when he invited

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
his piano teacher.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So there will be a lot of noise.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please, Pei Xun, play it for us.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you have a way to play it?

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, I do.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do you have a way to play it?

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes, I do.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you have a way to play it?

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, I do.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I want to share the screen again.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you.

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is a simple yearbook.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This amazing actress,

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
when she was 40,

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
it was her last time on stage.

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
After that,

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
no one saw her perform.

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
When she was 43,

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
she married Du Yuesheng,

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
who we just talked about,

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
the boss of the underworld.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A year later,

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Du Yuesheng passed away.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Du Yuesheng was seriously ill at the time.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
In the 1960s,

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
she moved to Taiwan.

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
She lived in Taiwan for a few years

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and then passed away.

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is a very brief yearbook.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's a brief overview of her life.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Before I talk more about

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
her relationship

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
with the gossip magazine,

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I want to provide you

210
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
some background information.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
In the 1970s,

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the competition

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
between genders

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
was very interesting.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In the 1970s,

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
there were only male actors

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
on the stage.

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
From 1970 to 1870,

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
there were only male actors

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
on the stage.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
On the stage,

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
no matter what the role was,

223
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it was all played by men.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It wasn't until 1870

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that some female actors

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
joined the industry.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Although some female actors

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
joined the industry,

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
in the society at the time,

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
there was always a

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
discrimination

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
between actors and prostitutes.

233
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We can't say

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it was discrimination.

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
In the 1970s,

236
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
1870s,

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and especially 1920s,

238
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we could see

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that some female actors

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
were already famous.

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They were good at singing and dancing

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and acting,

243
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
so they switched to acting.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We could also see

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that some female actors

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
were also taking classes

247
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
other than acting.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This was partly true,

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but it was also

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
a problem

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for some actors.

252
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In this speech,

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'd like to bring you

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to think about these questions.

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
First,

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
let's take a look at

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
how the gossip

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
from 1920s to 1950s

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
influenced

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Meng Xiaodong

261
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and how their

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
views on Meng Xiaodong

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
changed.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Second,

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'd like to discuss

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
how Meng Xiaodong

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
was full of

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
sexism.

269
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
if you know what sexism is.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
To put it simply,

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
sexism is

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
when a person's gender

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
is highlighted.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For example,

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Meng Xiaodong is a girl.

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There are a lot of gossip

278
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
about Meng Xiaodong's

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
gender.

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Later,

281
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
we'll have

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
more practical examples.

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So, I'd like to discuss

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
how Meng Xiaodong

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
exercised his autonomy

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to resist the sexism

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and misogyny of the gossip.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Third,

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
let's take a look

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
at how Meng Xiaodong

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
finally found

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
a solution

293
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
to help himself

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
from the gossip.

295
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Lastly,

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'd like to discuss

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
how Meng Xiaodong

298
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
is a legendary actress

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and is considered

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to be the best

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
virgin in Chinese history.

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
However,

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
there are restrictions

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
on his status.

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
His status is not

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
100% perfect.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What are the restrictions?

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
First, let's take a look

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
at a 2020 report.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In 2020,

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Meng Xiaodong was

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
around 10 years old.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I forgot.

314
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He was 13 years old.

315
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
In the report,

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
he wrote that

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
he wouldn't be affected

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
by gossips until he was 16 or 17.

319
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Gossips mean

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
his throat was damaged

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or his voice changed

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
when he was 16 or 17.

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He said he wouldn't be affected

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
by gossips until he was 16 or 17.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In the future,

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
gossips like

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
En Xiaofeng,

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Xiao Lanying,

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Chen Huifeng,

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
etc.

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We can see

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
two things here.

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
First, the report

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
was highly anticipated.

335
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Second,

336
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Meng Xiaodong

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
was discussed with

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
other senior female students.

339
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In the future,

340
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
female students

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
will discuss

342
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Meng Xiaodong with

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
female students

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and learn from him.

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I just wanted to

346
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
show you

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
what the report looked like

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
at the time.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Most of my papers

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
are based on the report.

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I read a lot of old newspapers.

352
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's what I read.

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In 1926,

354
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Meng Xiaodong was

355
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
living in Shanghai.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
In 1926,

357
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he decided to move to Beijing.

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
At that time,

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
people thought

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Shanghai made a lot of money

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but Beijing was a good place

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for an actor.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
However,

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
after he moved to Beijing,

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Shanghai newspapers

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
still liked to report his gossips.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
At that time,

368
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
there was no Internet,

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so news could be verified.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Many fake news

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
like

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Meng Xiaodong's suicide

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
were published.

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Some

375
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
vulgar news

376
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
like this

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
were published.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
When I read this news,

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was shocked.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I thought

381
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
people in the past

382
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
were not conservative.

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They could write

384
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
what they wanted to say.

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At that time,

386
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
there was a civil war.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Many military officials

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
took a fancy to Meng Xiaodong

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and forced him

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to move to his house.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Of course,

392
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
he didn't just

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
invite Meng Xiaodong to dinner.

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He wanted to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He said

396
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Meng Xiaodong

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
was not

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
his type.

399
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He had sex with Meng Xiaodong

400
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
every day.

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He felt

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
he was sick of it.

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He even

404
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
forced his family

405
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In the end,

407
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Meng Xiaodong died

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in this situation.

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It was a very exaggerated news.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
At the same time,

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
there were

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
similar news.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There were many

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
similar news.

415
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
For example,

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
let's look at

417
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the following news.

418
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Meng Xiaodong

419
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
was robbed

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
by a general.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They said

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Meng Xiaodong

423
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
was too small

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
After the robbery,

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Meng Xiaodong was locked up

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
by a general

428
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and sent to

429
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
a hospital.

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Meng Xiaodong's name

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
was used

432
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
to

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
show

434
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
the sexual behavior

435
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
between Meng Xiaodong

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and the general.

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The 87-yuan coin

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
was the

439
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
size of Meng Xiaodong's

440
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
sex organ.

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The 87-yuan coin

442
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
was the size of Meng Xiaodong's

443
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
sex organ.

444
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Meng Xiaodong was

445
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
robbed by a general

446
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and had sex with Meng Xiaodong.

447
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In the end,

448
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Meng Xiaodong was sick

449
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and sent to a hospital.

450
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
There were many

451
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
exaggerated news

452
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
about Meng Xiaodong.

453
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
As I said,

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
these news

455
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
constantly sexualized

456
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Meng Xiaodong.

457
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We call it

458
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
sexualization.

459
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It emphasizes

460
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Meng Xiaodong's gender

461
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and sexual

462
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
behavior.

463
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Of course,

464
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
some commentators

465
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
couldn't stand it.

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
For example,

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Aowong

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
wrote many articles

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
about Meng Xiaodong.

470
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He was a fan of Meng Xiaodong.

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He was so surprised

472
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that Meng Xiaodong

473
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
became a target

474
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
of gossip.

475
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So,

476
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Meng Xiaodong

477
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
should imitate an actor

478
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and marry a rich man

479
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
as soon as possible.

480
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then, no one

481
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
would gossip about Meng Xiaodong.

482
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
At that time,

483
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
many actresses

484
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
thought

485
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it was impossible

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to show off on stage.

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So,

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Meng Xiaodong should find a time

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to marry a rich man

490
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and live a happy life.

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He shouldn't show off anymore.

492
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
After all,

493
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
it's easy to be sexually harassed.

494
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
At that time,

495
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
people still thought

496
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
public women

497
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
were relatively

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
uncivilized.

499
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
For example,

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
prostitutes were

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
public women.

502
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So were actresses.

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'd like to add

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that

505
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the idea of

506
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
public women

507
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
still exists

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
in the 60s, 70s,

509
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and even in the 70s and 80s.

510
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
When I read

511
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
the records of Taiwanese actors,

512
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I can see that

513
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
some actresses

514
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
are attracted by marriage

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
on the stage.

516
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a common concept.

517
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
However,

518
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it's not the case today.

519
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
As I said,

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Meng Xiaodong was gossiped.

521
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So,

522
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Meng Xiaodong

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
moved to Beijing

524
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and married

525
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Mei Lanfang at the same time.

526
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
However,

527
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
it was well-hidden.

528
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
No one knew about it,

529
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
except close friends.

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No one knew about it.

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Let's talk about

532
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Mei Lanfang's family.

533
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Before Meng Xiaodong,

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Mei Lanfang had two wives.

535
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The first wife was Wang Minghua.

536
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The second wife was

537
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Fu Zhifang.

538
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Fu Zhifang was also an actress.

539
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I heard that Wang Minghua was also an actress.

540
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
However,

541
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Wang Minghua passed away early.

542
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So, I couldn't find his photo.

543
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Fu Zhifang was also an actress.

544
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Then,

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
she became the second wife of Mei Lanfang.

546
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Wang Minghua didn't have children.

547
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Then,

548
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
from

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
1926,

550
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
when Meng Xiaodong moved to Beijing,

551
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and many gossips started to talk about him,

552
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
to 1929,

553
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
basically,

554
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
no one knew

555
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
about Meng Xiaodong's whereabouts,

556
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
suicide,

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
marriage,

558
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
or sexual abuse.

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It was a maze.

560
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You could find different stories in newspapers.

561
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So,

562
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
until now,

563
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
for example,

564
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
this news report

565
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
was published in

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
1929,

567
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and was published in

568
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
February, 1929.

569
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
They said that

570
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
they published

571
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
these four photos

572
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and discussed

573
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
where Meng Xiaodong was,

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
who he was,

575
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and what he said.

576
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm afraid it's a problem,

577
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
but not a problem.

578
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Some people said that

579
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Mei Qi,

580
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
which means Mei Lanfang,

581
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
was about to give birth.

582
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Mei Qi's son

583
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
used a mirror.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Then,

585
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
as you can see,

586
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
these four photos

587
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
were taken

588
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
from right to left

589
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and ordered,

590
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
asking kiss

591
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and being kissed by others.

592
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They were also giving advice for

593
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
sister and Sister Ning.

594
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So,

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
they published

596
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
gossips photos

597
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
to discuss where Meng Xiaodong was and

598
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
finding it very interesting.

599
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
We mentioned that

600
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
gossip reporters

601
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
always wanted to find Meng Xiaodong,

602
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
but at the same time,

603
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
how could these photos

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
be posted on Beiyang Newspaper?

605
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Did they

606
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
deliberately

607
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
take photos of Meng Xiaodong?

608
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We don't know.

609
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
At the same time,

610
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
on February 9th,

611
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
a few days later,

612
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
there was another photo.

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
This is a photo of Mei Lanfang.

614
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
On the right, it says,

615
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What are you doing there?

616
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
On the left, it says,

617
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm taking a photo here.

618
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
On the right,

619
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
it says,

620
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
This is a photo about

621
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Mei Meng.

622
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
On the right,

623
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
it says,

624
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Meng Xiaodong.

625
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
On the left, it says,

626
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Mei Lanfang.

627
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Do you think

628
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
these two words

629
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
are written by different people?

630
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
To me,

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
these two words

632
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
are used to discuss

633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the relationship between

634
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong.

635
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We say that

636
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

637
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
are getting closer

638
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and getting married.

639
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But

640
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
can they live a happy life?

641
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Maybe not.

642
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Because we just talked about

643
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Mei Lanfang and two wives,

644
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Wang Minghua,

645
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and

646
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Fu Zhifang.

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Fu Zhifang is described as

648
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
a very jealous person.

649
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I didn't live in that era.

650
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't know them.

651
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So I don't know if Fu Zhifang

652
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
is really jealous.

653
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But the report said

654
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Fu Zhifang regards Mei Lanfang

655
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
as his own

656
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
exclusive mate.

657
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He doesn't allow

658
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
anyone to get close to Mei Lanfang.

659
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Another report said

660
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
everyone

661
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
hopes that

662
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

663
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
can get back together.

664
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
At that time, there were a lot of gossips.

665
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Some said they were divorced.

666
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Some said they were together.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The report said

668
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
everyone wants Mei Lanfang

669
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and Meng Xiaodong to be together.

670
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
They are a perfect couple.

671
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But

672
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Fu Zhifang doesn't want

673
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
them to be together.

674
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Because he thinks

675
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Mei Lanfang is his exclusive mate.

676
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So he doesn't allow anyone

677
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
to get close to Mei Lanfang.

678
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So

679
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
when these two

680
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
use exclusive mate

681
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to describe Mei Lanfang,

682
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
it shows

683
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
that

684
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in the drama,

685
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in the sexual scenes,

686
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
the female actors' power is obviously weaker

687
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and they are more likely to be harassed.

688
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They are more likely to be sexually harassed.

689
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They are more likely to be involved

690
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
in the gossips.

691
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
However,

692
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
in Mei Lanfang's home,

693
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
we can see another

694
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
sexual dynamic balance.

695
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's not as traditional

696
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
as we think.

697
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It seems that

698
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
men have more power.

699
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
On the contrary,

700
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Fu Zhifang seems to have more power.

701
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Moreover,

702
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
when they

703
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
describe Mei Lanfang

704
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
as their exclusive mate,

705
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it seems that

706
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Mei Lanfang is also

707
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
being sexually harassed

708
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
by Fu Zhifang

709
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
as her exclusive mate.

710
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They describe Mei Lanfang

711
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
as a piece of meat.

712
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's a piece of meat

713
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
that everyone wants.

714
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So we can see

715
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that Mei Lanfang is also

716
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
being sexually harassed by Fu Zhifang.

717
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
In this news article,

718
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
some people

719
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
describe Mei Lanfang

720
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
as a piece of meat

721
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
that everyone wants.

722
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
that everyone wants.

723
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Basically,

724
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.

725
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
to perform in the 1920s.

726
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
In this news article,

727
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.

728
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to perform in the 1920s.

729
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
When she came back to China,

730
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
she was very popular.

731
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
She was very popular.

732
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
She was very popular.

733
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
On the other hand,

734
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
her mother

735
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
died at the same time.

736
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Mei Lanfang was very sad.

737
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The worst part of this news article

738
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is that

739
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Mei Lanfang not only

740
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
felt sad for her mother's death,

741
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
but also wanted to

742
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
deal with the two beautiful wives.

743
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
deal with the two beautiful wives.

744
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The two beautiful wives

745
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
are not Wang Minghua,

746
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
but Fu Zhifang and Meng Xiaodong.

747
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Meng Xiaodong is the one

748
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
who is fighting for the two women.

749
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Mei Lanfang is very sad.

750
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Mei Lanfang is very sad.

751
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The gossip media

752
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
likes to show these things.

753
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The gossip media likes to show these things.

754
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The way these articles are reported

755
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
is very meaningful.

756
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is very meaningful.

757
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's not just about

758
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's not just about

759
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
discussing their family affairs.

760
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
discussing their family affairs.

761
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Then,

762
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Then,

763
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
in 1932,

764
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
in 1932,

765
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

766
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
officially divorced.

767
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Meng Xiaodong said

768
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Meng Xiaodong said

769
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Meng Xiaodong said

770
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Meng Xiaodong said

771
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
their relationship is always very good

772
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Meng Xiaodong said

773
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
their relationship is always very good

774
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Meng Xiaodong said

775
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
me and Wanhua

776
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Meng Xiaodong said

777
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
we also have no need to bother many people with separating

778
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
we also have no need to bother many people with separating

779
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
he meant that it's good to be separated

780
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
he was very polite

781
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
he meant that it's good to be separated

782
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
it's also mentioned on a report

783
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
about their divorce

784
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
so

785
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
then

786
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I will show you

787
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
what I circled

788
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
what I circled

789
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Meng Xiaodong's key difference

790
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
before that

791
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
he said it's good to be separated

792
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in 1933

793
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
so you can see

794
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
in 1932

795
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
he said it's good to be separated

796
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
in 1933 he got angry

797
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
because

798
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
the news wrote many awful things

799
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and it's very serious

800
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and it's very serious

801
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
some even said

802
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Meng Xiaodong was cheating or something

803
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
in 1933

804
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
there was a warning

805
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and at the same time

806
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
a lawyer said

807
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Meng Xiaodong

808
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Meng Xiaodong

809
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
hired me to be his lawyer

810
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
hired me to be his lawyer

811
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
so if anyone

812
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
dare to write nonsense

813
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
we will sue you

814
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
so Meng Xiaodong

815
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Meng Xiaodong

816
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
started to use the newspaper

817
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
as a counterattack

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
to his independence

819
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
this is a warning

820
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
to his independence

821
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
so

822
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
let me read it

823
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
let me read it

824
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the warrior, Meng Xiaodong,

825
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
was a child and very good at study

826
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
he was not very good at reading

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
he was not very good at studying

828
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and he never learned

829
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and he never learned

830
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and he never learned

831
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and he never learned

832
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
so

833
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
this is a warning

834
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
he can't stand it

835
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Meng Xiaodong thought it was annoying

836
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
he wanted to stop telling gossips

837
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
he wanted to stop telling gossips

838
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
but the interesting thing is

839
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
when I was looking for newspapers

840
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
when I was looking for newspapers

841
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I didn't find so many gossips

842
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I didn't find so many gossips

843
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I think one possibility is

844
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that those newspapers are gone

845
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
they didn't stay until today

846
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the second possibility is

847
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
maybe those gossips

848
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
are not published in the newspapers

849
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
they are more like a

850
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
gossip

851
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
gossip

852
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
gossip

853
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
gossip

854
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
gossip

855
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
gossip

856
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
gossip

857
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
gossip

858
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
gossip

859
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
gossip

860
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
gossip

861
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
gossip

862
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
gossip

863
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
gossip

864
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
gossip

865
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
gossip

866
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
gossip

867
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
gossip

868
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
gossip

869
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
gossip

870
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
gossip

871
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
clip

872
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
clip

873
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
clip

874
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And then after he published

875
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
that warning

876
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
he

877
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Later on, he began to worship

878
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry to worship Yu Shuyan as a teacher

879
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Then here we will

880
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It will be involved in how he

881
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
turn that is the actress

882
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
in the drama circle

883
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
status

884
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So when I read the magazine

885
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I will also see a very interesting phenomenon

886
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
is that they discuss the actor

887
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
They call her Mingling

888
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The male actor is called the female spirit

889
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But why is the male actor not the male spirit

890
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Or the female actor is not Mingling

891
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Just this way of classification

892
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
In fact, it has already shown the society at the time

893
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
He is the whole

894
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is the sexual imagination

895
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The male actor is the famous Mingling

896
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The actress is a female actor

897
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Then

898
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
He

899
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Mo Xiaodong

900
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
One of the ways to turn this way

901
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's very

902
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Very ironic

903
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
His way

904
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
His way of sarcasm is

905
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
How do you turn a girl

906
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
In the drama circle

907
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
First of all, you have to have a super famous

908
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Male teacher

909
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You can't go to a female teacher again

910
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Because the actress has already been looked down upon

911
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What's the use of going to a female teacher

912
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You must find a famous male teacher

913
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And this male teacher must be respected by everyone

914
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And then on stage

915
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How does he show himself

916
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You can't play yourself

917
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You can't play your own style

918
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Because no one cares about your style

919
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You have to play Yu Shuyuan

920
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You have to play Yu

921
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You are not

922
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
For example, you are playing Zhuge Liang on stage today

923
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You are not playing Zhuge Liang

924
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You are playing Zhuge Liang

925
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Only through this way

926
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
To make others feel

927
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You are a good actor

928
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because you are better than those other male actors

929
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There is a way

930
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Like Yu Shuyuan

931
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So like Yu Shuyuan

932
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Is a very important point

933
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So in this whole

934
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Within the scope of gender performance

935
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Meng Xiaodong, he blurs

936
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The boundary between the male spirit and the female spirit

937
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He

938
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He is no longer just a female spirit

939
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
He is also a male spirit

940
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because he is better than male actors

941
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Can perform Yu's Zhuge Liang

942
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Zhuge Liang

943
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Then we said

944
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Before

945
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
When he was 13

946
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The report said

947
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
If he grows up to 16 or 17 years old

948
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
He will definitely be like these women

949
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's the same

950
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But

951
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This situation is

952
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
After he lost to Yu Shuyuan

953
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
There are very different changes

954
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
For example, there is a report that says

955
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There is a special case

956
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He is Meng Xiaodong

957
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
All female actors

958
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Anyway, female actors are female actors

959
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But there is a special case

960
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
He is Meng Xiaodong

961
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Or they will

962
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Keep talking about Meng Xiaodong's voice

963
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Then say

964
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Meng Xiaodong's voice is

965
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Better than Tan Fuying

966
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Better than Ma Lianliang

967
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Better than Yan Jipeng

968
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Better than Wang Youzhen

969
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
All these

970
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Sorry, Wang Youchen

971
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So all these names

972
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
All these names

973
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Are very famous male students

974
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So when they put Meng Xiaodong

975
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This name and other famous male actors

976
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
When comparing

977
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It means he can already succeed

978
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Can't say it's a complete success

979
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But at least he challenged

980
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
In the industry

981
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Gender rights

982
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then another one

983
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
This report

984
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Just show you the title

985
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao

986
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Worth a compliment

987
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Compare with Xiaodong

988
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We just talked about

989
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yu Shuyuan's life

990
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Two disciples

991
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
One is Li Shaochun

992
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The other is Meng Xiaodong

993
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
From this title alone

994
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We can see

995
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Obviously this commentator

996
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He thinks Meng Xiaodong is better

997
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Because if

998
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He thinks Meng Xiaodong is worse

999
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Why take Li Shaochun and Meng Xiaodong

1000
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
To compare

1001
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He can say

1002
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao is worth a compliment

1003
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Much better than Meng Xiaodong

1004
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
He doesn't need to compare with Meng Xiaodong

1005
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Of course it's because Meng Xiaodong's performance is better

1006
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So Li Shaochun is also very good

1007
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But not as good as Meng Xiaodong

1008
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So I have to compare with Meng Xiaodong

1009
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So again

1010
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
We have seen

1011
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
When he was in his 20s

1012
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
When people talk about actors

1013
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Talking about female actors is talking about female actors

1014
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Talking about male actors is talking about male actors

1015
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The age and age of women are not related

1016
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But now he broke that boundary

1017
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Then

1018
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
In 1943

1019
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
When he studied with Yu Shuyuan for about six years

1020
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Unfortunately, Yu Shuyuan passed away

1021
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Then he wrote in the newspaper

1022
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
A report

1023
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This is my English translation

1024
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This is my English translation

1025
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But the original text is

1026
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

1027
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

1028
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance

1029
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance

1030
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Then

1031
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The second

1032
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Then the fourth line

1033
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
He wants to say

1034
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues

1035
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues

1036
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Senior and junior

1037
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
They will continue to perform

1038
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
They will continue to perform

1039
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Then they will

1040
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan

1041
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan

1042
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And me

1043
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I have no achievements

1044
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I have no achievements

1045
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We just talked about

1046
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We just talked about

1047
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
He is blurred

1048
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The boundary between male and female actors

1049
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The boundary between male and female actors

1050
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But in this report

1051
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
He blurs himself very much

1052
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think this

1053
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I think this article is actually a very interesting thing

1054
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I think this article is actually a very interesting thing

1055
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Meng Xiaodong is a bit

1056
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
He is a bit cynical

1057
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
He is a bit cynical

1058
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So when he said

1059
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

1060
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I just can't do it very well

1061
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors

1062
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors

1063
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
He really feels that way

1064
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
He really feels that way

1065
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm not very sure

1066
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm not very sure

1067
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What is he thinking

1068
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But this way of writing

1069
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You can feel

1070
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
He is a woman

1071
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
He is a woman

1072
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But he wants to learn the fish

1073
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But he wants to learn the fish

1074
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
He has some resentment

1075
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He has some resentment

1076
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Not so simple emotions

1077
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
He has some very complicated things in it

1078
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
These very complicated emotions

1079
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Including the one in the drama

1080
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Including the one in the drama

1081
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Gender and then

1082
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And all the time

1083
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Everyone thinks that female actors

1084
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Everyone thinks that female actors

1085
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Because I feel that what conditions are born

1086
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Because I feel that what conditions are born

1087
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Will make them unable to play well

1088
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Will make them unable to play well

1089
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Although Meng Xiaodong is very

1090
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Although Meng Xiaodong is very

1091
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
He said he had no achievements

1092
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But in fact, in the later newspaper

1093
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
A lot of people describe it

1094
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
A lot of people describe it

1095
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Fish succulent

1096
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Or I would say

1097
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Fish succulent is dead

1098
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The only way we can hear

1099
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The only way we can hear

1100
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The only way we can hear

1101
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

1102
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

1103
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

1104
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Meng Xiaodong

1105
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Meng Xiaodong

1106
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Meng Xiaodong

1107
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I went out to envy

1108
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
This happened in Shanghai

1109
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
He said no

1110
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
He said I was not angry

1111
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
He said I was not angry

1112
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I don't want to break the tradition

1113
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
My teacher never taught me

1114
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I have to come out to admire

1115
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I have to come out to admire

1116
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
There is a very interesting point

1117
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
There is a very interesting point

1118
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You must come out to admire

1119
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You must come out to admire

1120
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You must come out to admire

1121
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Who invented this

1122
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's Meilanfang

1123
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It was started in Shanghai

1124
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It was started in Shanghai

1125
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
When Meng Xiaodong said

1126
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
When Meng Xiaodong said

1127
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It was a new trend

1128
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It was a new trend

1129
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But at the same time

1130
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It may be to a certain extent

1131
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Back then

1132
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Back then

1133
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Back then

1134
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Upset

1135
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I thought it was a matter of course

1136
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I thought it was a matter of course

1137
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And

1138
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
The last point

1139
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Let's talk about

1140
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The style of the fish

1141
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The style of the fish

1142
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring

1143
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring

1144
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Let him get a lot

1145
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Let him get a lot

1146
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And a lot of viewers love him

1147
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And a lot of viewers love him

1148
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Both Meng Xiaodong and Meilanfang

1149
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Will perform at the birthday party

1150
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Will perform at the birthday party

1151
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So the gossip reporters started to move

1152
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So the gossip reporters started to move

1153
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I want to see them perform together

1154
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I want to see them perform together

1155
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So

1156
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So

1157
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The point here is

1158
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

1159
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

1160
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
He became a very good performer

1161
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He became a very good performer

1162
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
The performance was worth it

1163
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I even feel that after Yu Shuyan died

1164
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I can only rely on Meng Xiaodong

1165
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But you can't control these things

1166
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But you can't control these things

1167
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Don't talk about his gossip

1168
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
These things

1169
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
These things

1170
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Don't let everyone talk about his gossip

1171
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There are some more detailed stories

1172
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
There are some more detailed stories

1173
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I won't say anymore

1174
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I won't say anymore

1175
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
As we say, he's in his 20s

1176
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Some unconsciously

1177
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Some unconsciously

1178
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
2017

1179
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Although he's not like before

1180
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Although he's not like before

1181
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
However, these things

1182
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Are not able to completely avoid

1183
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Moreover, this will also hurt

1184
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It feels that

1185
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
His realization is to learn from others

1186
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
His realization is to learn from others

1187
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He's not able to create his own ranks

1188
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But I think this is a

1189
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In this era, sometimes there will be some

1190
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Unnecessary restrictions

1191
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You can't ask a person

1192
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
To completely

1193
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
To completely

1194
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
To completely

1195
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
To completely

1196
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
To completely

1197
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
To completely

1198
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
To completely

1199
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
To completely

1200
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
To completely

1201
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To completely

1202
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
To completely

1203
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Time is almost up

1204
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I quickly tell you

1205
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I hope that everyone remembers

1206
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I hope that everyone remembers

1207
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What we discussed

1208
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
From 1920 to 1950

1209
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The public

1210
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
The public and gossip

1211
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
About what happened to Meng Xiaodong

1212
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
We just said

1213
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
From the beginning

1214
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
He was considered as a woman

1215
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And was constantly misinterpreted

1216
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

1217
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Everyone saw

1218
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
His achievements in the art of fish

1219
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And see him in the art of fish

1220
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And we have to recognize one thing

1221
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's because he lost to Yu Shuyan

1222
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's because he learned fish well

1223
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So everyone recognizes his achievements

1224
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
If he lost today

1225
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Any excellent female teacher

1226
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Maybe everyone won't think so

1227
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Then

1228
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So all the way we can see

1229
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Everyone gossip

1230
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
From misinterpretation

1231
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
To respect

1232
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
To see him as a good artist

1233
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
To see him as a good artist

1234
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But at the same time

1235
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But at the same time

1236
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's not like

1237
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
We will discuss the art of fish

1238
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We will discuss the art of fish

1239
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's not like that

1240
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
There are some restrictions

1241
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
There are some restrictions

1242
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Then

1243
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
How did Meng Xiaodong

1244
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Resist those

1245
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Misinterpreted reports

1246
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Misinterpreted reports

1247
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Mainly

1248
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Mainly I answer this question

1249
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm using

1250
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Meng Xiaodong's report on the police

1251
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Meng Xiaodong's report on the police

1252
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's gossip news

1253
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
He also uses newspapers to respond

1254
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
These reports

1255
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That is to say the newspaper as a public space

1256
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That is to say the newspaper as a public space

1257
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Then you can use it

1258
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
To attack you

1259
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The third point is

1260
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
How did Meng Xiaodong

1261
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Find a way

1262
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
To get him

1263
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
To get him

1264
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
To get him

1265
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
To get him

1266
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
In this way

1267
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I personally think

1268
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Because he worshiped Yu Shuyan

1269
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
He worshipped Yu Shuyan and studied very hard

1270
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Let the public think

1271
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
He is the male version of Yu Shuyan

1272
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
He is the only one who can be considered

1273
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He is the only one who can be considered

1274
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He is the only one who can be considered

1275
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
He uses a male teacher

1276
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
He uses a male teacher

1277
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
To be the shield

1278
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Of course he did well

1279
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
To draw these gossips

1280
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
The last point we said

1281
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
He performed

1282
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Actually, it's all about performing his teacher

1283
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
What are the restrictions on the teacher?

1284
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
On the one hand, of course

1285
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Perform your teacher

1286
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Don't let those gossips

1287
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Completely away from you

1288
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
As long as there is an opportunity

1289
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
The gossip media will still be

1290
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The reporter will still be active

1291
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
The second is that you perform your teacher

1292
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But what you perform is always his style

1293
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You can't create your own style

1294
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yes, and finally

1295
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I want to show you

1296
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
A trailer

1297
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Then ask Pei Xuan to prepare

1298
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Help me broadcast this trailer

1299
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
This trailer is a movie

1300
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Mei Lanfang

1301
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
2008 movie

1302
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Mei Lanfang is played by Li Ming

1303
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Meng Xiaodong is played by Zhang Ziyi

1304
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
To be honest, it's not a particularly good movie

1305
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because the family had a lot of

1306
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Because the family had a lot of

1307
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Rebellion and unhappiness

1308
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How can you write my ancestor like this

1309
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So some parts of this movie

1310
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's pretty beautiful

1311
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Especially inside

1312
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
There is a

1313
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Mei Lanfang's

1314
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Friend is Qi Rushan

1315
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
He later came to Taiwan and became

1316
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Taiwan is very famous

1317
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Famous people in the cultural world

1318
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's also very serious

1319
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because I think it's with the Kuomintang

1320
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Anyway

1321
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Anyway, it's fun

1322
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
If you are interested in knowing more

1323
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You can also watch this kind of movie

1324
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Then if you are interested

1325
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
If you know more, you can

1326
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Google different things on the Internet

1327
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Please help me broadcast this documentary

1328
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Thank you all

1329
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's not a documentary, it's a movie

1330
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Miss Meng

1331
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Mei Daye

1332
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
See you on stage

1333
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Who destroyed her lonely dream

1334
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You dare

1335
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It's for Mei Lanfang

1336
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Know

1337
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
What do you have

1338
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Just say it

1339
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

1340
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It turned out to be this sentence

1341
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Meng Xiaodong will never meet Mei Lanfang again

1342
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Say it again

1343
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Meng Xiaodong

1344
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Let go

1345
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You dare to lie to me

1346
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Because you can't leave Mei Lanfang

1347
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Who is your sister

1348
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Tang Xiaohong

1349
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You dare

1350
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Thank you

1351
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Thank you

1352
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
My speech ends here

1353
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Thank you all

1354
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Thank you Yunpu

1355
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Thank you for his wonderful speech

1356
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now it's time for Q&A

1357
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1358
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1359
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
If not

1360
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'll ask the first question

1361
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I'll ask the first question

1362
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I want to ask

1363
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
In that era, including the small newspaper

1364
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Who is the main target?

1365
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Who is the main target?

1366
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Who is the main target?

1367
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Who reads newspapers today?

1368
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Who reads newspapers today?

1369
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Because most people

1370
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Because most people

1371
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They read the newspaper

1372
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
They read the newspaper

1373
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Can't completely say

1374
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Can't completely say

1375
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Not a real literate

1376
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Not a real literate

1377
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Not a real literate

1378
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
He read the dictionary

1379
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
He read the dictionary

1380
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
He doesn't want to be a poet

1381
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What green-daisy history poems

1382
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
What green-daisy history poems

1383
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
What green-daisy history poems

1384
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,000


1385
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I remember, just

1386
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I used to read Poetry Dream

1387
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It was for example that their

1388
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It was for example that their

1389
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It was for example that their

1390
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
poetry

1391
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
this is the people more or less

1392
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I think

1393
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
first of all, the Red Dragon dream was passed down

1394
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
primero, la playa comprehensivamente

1395
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
gradually collapsed, there is a relationship

1396
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
so

1397
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't know what to say about them

1398
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I believe it is

1399
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
There must be some people like the Red Dragon dream

1400
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Anyway, the family is

1401
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
After the family comes to the middle

1402
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Then come to see those gossip

1403
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
right

1404
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But to say

1405
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
In the end

1406
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
In the end

1407
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Who is the one who sees it completely?

1408
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I think

1409
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I think the people who see it

1410
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's very wide

1411
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's from

1412
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Very wide, but not to everyone

1413
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Because after all, many people are literate

1414
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But the problem is that you are really

1415
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The kind of high class is really

1416
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
The kind of literate

1417
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
More aristocratic

1418
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then they are quite ignorant

1419
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I want to ask a question

1420
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That is to say

1421
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So Meng Xiaodong is in that era

1422
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Is the first person to worship Nanlaoshi as a teacher?

1423
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Is there anyone else doing this in the future?

1424
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think I see it now

1425
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I see it now, I think he is

1426
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
The first person to worship Nanlaoshi so formally

1427
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It wasn't before

1428
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
But everyone might just learn a play

1429
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Or say a few words

1430
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So that probably doesn't count

1431
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Is the real worship

1432
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Then is there anyone after him?

1433
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Because there are still a lot of female teachers today

1434
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Can't say a lot, there are still female teachers in the drama world today

1435
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yes

1436
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Thank you

1437
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
May I ask

1438
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
If you have any questions

1439
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You can ask now

1440
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Or if you want to post it in the chat room

1441
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I can also help you

1442
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Ok

1443
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
There is a question in the chat room

1444
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Is it qualitative research?

1445
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Or can it be quantified?

1446
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I think I should be considered qualitative research

1447
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
After all, it is file research

1448
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Then analyze

1449
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Some articles

1450
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Can it be quantified?

1451
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
This is a good question

1452
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because I did a digital paper before

1453
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Then I have put a part of

1454
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The file I collected

1455
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Is it quantified?

1456
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
But I think

1457
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That quantification is still very shallow

1458
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's more like

1459
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All about these gossips

1460
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
For example, in different cities

1461
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Then there are a few

1462
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Then there are a few different newspapers

1463
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Some cities are also more popular

1464
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But this algorithm

1465
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
There are still some problems

1466
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Because you say where the newspapers are the most

1467
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Of course, Beijing and Shanghai are the most

1468
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
But can this explain

1469
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Can it be said that it is not popular in Wuxi?

1470
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because it is also very popular in Wuxi

1471
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But the newspapers in Wuxi are not as many as those in Beijing and Shanghai

1472
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I think

1473
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It can be quantified

1474
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But there are many traps to be careful

1475
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
In addition to gossip newspaper

1476
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Are there any other sources?

1477
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
About this

1478
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I use gossip newspaper

1479
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But some of my other articles

1480
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
For example

1481
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Female actors wrote their own memoirs

1482
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Something like this

1483
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Then some will

1484
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
There is one thing I think I can

1485
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Just clarify

1486
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Why is most of it gossip newspaper?

1487
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Because the newspaper did not want to write them

1488
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Just these people

1489
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Just these people

1490
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
They want to discuss more serious things

1491
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
He didn't want to write these gossips

1492
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So this is why I found

1493
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Most of them are gossip newspaper

1494
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Or what kind of newspaper

1495
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Source

1496
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Then I have a question

1497
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It may be related to this

1498
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So at that time, the newspaper

1499
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Will not discuss at all

1500
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
These

1501
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Artistic things

1502
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Or they will discuss other forms of art

1503
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
But they feel that the newspaper is not enough

1504
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Or why?

1505
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
For them

1506
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
This is not art at all

1507
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
For them, this is like today

1508
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
For example

1509
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Will Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen say it is art?

1510
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It doesn't seem to be

1511
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's just a popular entertainment

1512
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I seem to be a little disrespectful to Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen

1513
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Sorry

1514
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Anyway, in that era

1515
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
The newspaper is a popular entertainment

1516
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You don't think it's art

1517
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Popular entertainment is like

1518
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like today's stars

1519
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Who is in a relationship with who

1520
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Who got married and divorced

1521
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Just this feeling

1522
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
So do you think Jay Chou will discuss these things?

1523
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Maybe a lot

1524
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Especially

1525
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I didn't talk about it in this speech

1526
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Probably

1527
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Around 1930

1528
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
There was a shooting case

1529
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's also related to Meng Xiaodong

1530
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Anyway

1531
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
The gossip is widely spread

1532
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
What do you say about Meng Xiaodong's admirer

1533
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Then I'm not happy that Meng Xiaodong is married to Mei Lanfang

1534
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And then I'm going to shoot Mei Lanfang

1535
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's about shooting

1536
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Of course, the newspaper will report it

1537
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But

1538
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
For gossip

1539
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But in general

1540
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
They may publish a lot

1541
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It's a drama advertisement

1542
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
You can see

1543
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
What kind of play was played today

1544
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But they won't

1545
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Write some exaggerated gossip

1546
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
So I mean

1547
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So these newspapers won't write about

1548
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Artistic comments on the drama

1549
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Or do they actually have any

1550
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Artistic comments are not included in the newspaper

1551
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
According to the newspaper of that era

1552
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
They will write artistic comments

1553
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But they almost only comment on male actors

1554
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And it's very serious

1555
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That kind of comment

1556
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
For example

1557
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
For example, he said

1558
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Someone played Si Lang Tan Mu

1559
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Then he based on that Si Lang Tan Mu

1560
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
How to sing each sentence

1561
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And then make a super detailed comment

1562
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So even in Meng Xiaodong

1563
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It's like

1564
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It's considered

1565
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The first person in the old god

1566
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Even after the first person

1567
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
These shocking newspapers

1568
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I still don't want to comment on his drama

1569
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I remember that

1570
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I have seen some

1571
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Not so many

1572
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
More actually appeared in a newspaper

1573
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Called Beiyang Newspaper

1574
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
That Beiyang Newspaper is basically

1575
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Meng Xiaodong's fans

1576
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I can't say that the whole Beiyang Newspaper is reporting Meng Xiaodong

1577
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But the editor-in-chief of Beiyang Newspaper

1578
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Sha Dafeng and several comments in it

1579
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They are all Meng Xiaodong's fans

1580
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So they reported a lot about him

1581
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Whether it's gossip

1582
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But because they are fans

1583
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So their gossip won't be that bad

1584
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
They will

1585
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
There will also be some positive news

1586
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
About his performance

1587
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But first of all, the fans' eyes

1588
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Are all with rose filters

1589
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So they may also write more

1590
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You know

1591
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It will be more beautiful

1592
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Thank you

1593
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Does anyone else have other questions?

1594
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Or do you think

1595
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I don't speak clearly

1596
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Want me to clarify again

1597
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
How to determine

1598
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Gossip newspaper

1599
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Is it exaggerated

1600
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
How to determine

1601
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The topic you discussed today

1602
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The impact on the aftermath

1603
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Okay, first of all, I think

1604
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
We can't be sure if the gossip newspaper is exaggerated

1605
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Because after all

1606
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We are not from that era

1607
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And even if we are from that era

1608
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Everyone will have a different opinion on one thing

1609
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I think the only thing I can do

1610
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Is to compare different gossip newspapers

1611
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
To discuss

1612
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
What they present

1613
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
What is it

1614
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So I'm not going to comment

1615
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
What the gossip newspaper writes is true or false

1616
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
That's not important

1617
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
What I want to discuss is how the gossip newspaper discusses Meng Xiaodong

1618
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And the topic I discussed today

1619
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
The impact on the aftermath

1620
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Should refer to contribution

1621
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I think

1622
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
What I care about the most

1623
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Is the right to speak in history

1624
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And the competition between genders

1625
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So what I'm going to discuss

1626
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So what I'm going to discuss today

1627
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
To be honest

1628
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I don't care about Meng Xiaodong's story

1629
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Whether it's true or false

1630
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Whether those comments are true or false

1631
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
The point is that I want to know

1632
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
In that society

1633
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Through a story like Meng Xiaodong

1634
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Their contribution between genders

1635
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And the whole country

1636
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
From the country to the Beijing Opera

1637
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
To the family

1638
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
How is their gender

1639
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Interaction between power and language

1640
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This is what I want to know the most

1641
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And then I want to know through this story

1642
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
To understand that period of time

1643
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
How the language of the whole society

1644
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
How does the right to speak work

1645
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I hope this answers your question

1646
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Then I have another question

1647
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
If the audience still has you

1648
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That is to say

1649
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
In the process of speaking

1650
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That is to say

1651
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That's the second wife in the south

1652
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
When she reported to her husband

1653
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
That is to say

1654
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Then you mentioned

1655
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
It seems that this power relationship

1656
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's a bit convoluted

1657
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I think it seems

1658
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm not sure

1659
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
My doubt is

1660
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Many times

1661
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
You only call one person

1662
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It should be said that many times

1663
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Kindness seems to be a

1664
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Special attack on women

1665
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It doesn't sound like

1666
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
A power relationship computer

1667
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But a

1668
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
A special way to target women

1669
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Because

1670
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Continue

1671
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I just want to say

1672
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I want to say

1673
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I hardly hear anyone say

1674
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
A man is kind

1675
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But you often hear people like to comment on women

1676
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So this is a

1677
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm repeating

1678
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's a way to target women

1679
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Instead of a power relationship computer

1680
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I think you're really good at this

1681
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I think it's here again

1682
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Showed

1683
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I think it's about gender

1684
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
The dynamic and power relationship

1685
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I think he seems to be

1686
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's hard to say

1687
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's fixed every time

1688
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
That is to say

1689
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There may be a general trend

1690
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
But if you look closely

1691
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It can be divided into a lot of things

1692
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And I totally agree

1693
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The kindness of women

1694
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Kindness is a plan

1695
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But at the same time

1696
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They can target this matter

1697
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Is to make a big article

1698
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
For example, they never talk about Wang Minghua

1699
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Kindness, they only talk about Fu Zhifang

1700
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I think this matter actually reflects

1701
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Fu Zhifang at home

1702
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
He does have power

1703
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Because you go to see other

1704
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Other is the actor

1705
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
The relationship between them is that private life

1706
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You hardly see anything like Fu Zhifang

1707
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Almost all

1708
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
What do you want to do

1709
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
If you want to have an affair with someone, have an affair

1710
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Then their wife is in the position of the victim

1711
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I will add another example

1712
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
He is not in the Republic of China

1713
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
He is in

1714
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Dorothy Cole

1715
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I suddenly forgot

1716
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Anyway, it was during the Ming and Qing dynasties

1717
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Everyone usually thinks

1718
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
The status of women

1719
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
It feels like it's all over

1720
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Suppressed by men

1721
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But there are also scholars

1722
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
They will do some research

1723
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
If you look closely

1724
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The relationship in the family

1725
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You will find that the male owners

1726
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Men are fighting outside

1727
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
As an official

1728
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Then stay away from home

1729
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
But actually at home

1730
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Daughter and son

1731
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Support the whole family

1732
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So their status

1733
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
May not be as low as everyone imagines

1734
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
He used this method to discuss

1735
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Sexual power sometimes

1736
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Not so absolute

1737
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It's like a man

1738
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Thank you

1739
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Is there any audience

1740
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Any questions

1741
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
If not

1742
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I will turn off the recording first
