00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech on April 16, 2022.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The speaker we invited today is Jian Muhua.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
He graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Atmospheric Engineering.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
After graduation, he explored his own interests in Taiwan for a few years, such as running a super marathon.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
In 2016, he went to the University of New York to study mathematics.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
In 2018, he continued to study at the University of New York's Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology.

00:42.000 --> 00:53.000
His speech today is on the simplification model of hot air and typhoons.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
We are looking forward to his speech.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
According to TAIRA's tradition, please turn on your microphones.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Let's applaud and welcome Jian Muhua.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Now I will give the floor to Jian Muhua.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Thank you, Shi-An.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I am very happy to be able to come to TAIRA to share my own research.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
This is my current research topic.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Because there are some relatively professional parts in the content.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I just saw that many participants are actually people in our field.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
So I still maintain the original way of speaking.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
If you are interested, we can discuss it later in the message.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
I am Jian Muhua.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I am Jian Muhua.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
I am a program student at the Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology at the University of New York.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
This program mainly deals with atmospheric or ocean topics related to application mathematics.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
I will start.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Let me introduce myself.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I am a son of a person.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
My mother is also listening.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I recently became a father.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I am a child.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I recently took care of my son in Taiwan.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
I also ran a super marathon.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
I am also a PhD student at NYU.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I am also engaged in relevant initiatives on Taiwan issues.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I studied at a university in Taiwan.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
I also studied at NYU.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
I also took part in activities in Taiwan community.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I also took part in our school community meetings.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
The following are the activities I have held.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
I have been to many of these events.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I will start today's topic.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Today's topic is the atmosphere in the heat wave.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
What can we see in the heat wave?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't know what to see.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
So I found a photo from NASA first.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
It is a photo taken from space to the earth.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
We can see a lot of clouds.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
This is the first thing to see.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
The second thing is that we can see a hot air balloon in the photo.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Or everyone thinks this is a typhoon.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I think as an atmospheric researcher,

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
It is inevitable that we must bring this issue to our living environment.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
This is related to climate change.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
My question is related to climate change.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
How will the heat wave change when the climate changes?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Or what kind of impact will the change have on us?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Because my topic is not about the impact.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So I will talk about what kind of impact it will have.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
The emergence of extreme weather events is directly affected by climate change.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
When the environment changes, the typhoon may become stronger.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
In the past few years, we have felt drought or extreme rainfall in Taiwan.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Extreme weather events may increase.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
This is my own view.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
I think we have studied this topic for a long time.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
For example, we have studied this topic for a long time.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
But in fact, there are still some uncertainties in understanding this issue.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
There are still many uncertainties in forecasting or understanding this matter.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
We can give an approximate situation.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Most of these uncertain factors come from the clouds we see in this photo.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
That is, the impact of water vapor in the physical system.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
So my topic today is actually about water vapor.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
If you are in our field, you will know that this is probably the part of atmospheric thermodynamics.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Today is a simple introduction.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
Before the next video, I think what I want to say is a bit like this.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
We want to know the impact of extreme events on us.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
We have to understand our original state first.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Or what is the physical structure behind it?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Or what is the mathematical structure?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
We can say how many degrees we have changed today.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
How will the climate change?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
If you don't have a background knowledge, you know what its original state is.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Or what is the physics behind it?

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
You can't know what it will become after it changes.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
So today's speech will focus on its background state.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Before we start, we know what the background state is.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
What is stability? What is instability?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Stability is what we can observe.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
We can know what it is without artificial influence.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Or what it is like in the original physical structure.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
I found a simple concept on the Internet.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What is stability? What is instability?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
First, we can imagine it as a bowl.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
There is a ball in the bowl.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
When you put the ball in, the ball will roll to the lowest point of the bowl.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
How do you move? You push the ball a little bit.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Or you give it a certain range of force.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It won't leave the bottom of the bowl too far.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Then we will call this state stability.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
If you put the bowl in the opposite direction,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Or you put the ball on a slope,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
The ball will roll to a far place.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Then this situation is not stable.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
The third situation is neutral.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
It is a neutral state.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The ball can roll anywhere.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
It may be relatively stable in any place.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I think what I want to say is that our climate is more inclined to this state.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
We have a stable state.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
But in the case of climate change, we may become another situation.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
It will have a new stability.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Another stability can be more stable.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
But this is from point A to point B.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
There may be more extreme events.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Or fewer extreme events.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Or a certain extreme event, such as more droughts.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Or there will be more rainfall.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We still need to do more research.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
But before all this, we can still understand the stability of state A.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
What is the material behind it?

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
So today's story will probably focus on what our atmosphere is.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay, let's start the topic now.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
The first point after entering the topic is what we want to talk about.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
The first point is buoyancy.

08:01.000 --> 08:09.000
When I was in middle school, buoyancy was a difficult topic.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
At that time, the teacher gave a big concept.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That is, buoyancy equals gravity.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
What is gravity?

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
If we see a object floating on an object,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
The object floating on the object can hold its weight.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
So this buoyancy can hold its weight.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
Of course, it can also be said that we can dig out the original fluid.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Then it can replace its weight.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Then it can extend to the second and third layers.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
If I have an object sinking in the middle today.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Or it happens to float in this fluid.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Then we know that the density of this thing or the weight of this thing is equal to the weight of the buoyancy.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
That is to say, the density of these two things is basically the same.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
The next situation is that the density of this thing is relatively large.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Then it will sink to the bottom.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
So buoyancy can't support the original weight.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
That buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid in this space.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
What about the concept of buoyancy?

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
How do we apply it to the atmosphere?

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
This is a participant in this experiment.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Come and listen to this speech.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
How do we know that the density distribution is in the vertical atmosphere?

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
Because if we know the density distribution, we know that the object will sink down or float up.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
In a direct way, we measure its temperature and air pressure.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
We can know that the density of the ideal gas equation.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Of course, we can't measure it at every height.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
The simplest way is to close a balloon and let the balloon fly up.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
In the process of flying, it will record the temperature and air pressure at each height.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Then we know the density of each layer of air.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We can know the desitny of each layer of air.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Before we do this, we can do another thing.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Before we do this, we can do another thing.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
It is reduced with height.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
However, the pressure is reduced with height.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The pressure is reduced with height.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
On the left chart,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
On the left chart,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
More than 1,000 times roaring.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
More than 1,000 times roaring.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
It may be 100 times roaring.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
This is the anti-intuition thing.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
This is the anti-intuition thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
The temperature is getting lower.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
The temperature is getting lower.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
However, the density is getting smaller.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The deeper the water water boils,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
The deeper the water boils,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
The deeper the water boils,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The deeper the water boils,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
The larger the temperature,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
The larger the temperature of the lower ?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
The lower the temperature of the lower channel.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
The lower the temperature of the earth's heat,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
The lower the river is.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
This is an interesting thing.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
This is an interesting thing.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
How do we know that

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
How do we know that

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
The stable atmosphere we just thought about

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
How do we discuss

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
How do we discuss

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
To measure this atmosphere,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
To measure this atmosphere,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Just use the imagined way

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Just use the imagined way

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Just use the imagined way

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I�e balloons

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
For example, the height here

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
For example, the height here

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I put a balloon

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I move it somewhere else

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
And see when

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I move it somewhere else

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
When, at a specified height

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Will the balloon move up

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Or down

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And say

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
And say

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Is the atmosphere stable

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Is the atmosphere stable

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
No

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
No

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Is the atmosphere stable

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
No

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Will that be strange

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
We often have birthday parties

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Or sometimes when there's a party

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Or sometimes when there's a party

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Balloon

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
It's usually inside

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
The balloon

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
It's usually floating in the air

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
We can put that

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Relax

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
The balloon will float up

12:39.000 --> 12:40.040
That

12:40.040 --> 12:42.000
The process of floating up the balloon

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
The higher the effect

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
If we are outdoors

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The garlic will explode

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Will it break

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That's

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
She just

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Have you wondered why

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Why

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
The reason is because

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
The pressure on the environment changes

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
After you put the balloon on

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
That means your balloon

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
The original air will get more and more

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Expansion

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
After the expansion

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
The outer layer of yours

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
No way

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Support you

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
When the pressure

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
The balloon will explode

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
That means

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
We

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
What I just said

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
If we move the A balloon to the B balloon

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
It's not actually

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
A to B

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
It's like this

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
In the process

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
It will slowly expand

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
What is the principle of expansion

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Oops

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
The principle of expansion

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
It's actually the first law of thermodynamics

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
That is

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
The first law of thermodynamics

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
In another idea

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Our heating will be equal to the change in temperature

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Plus

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Uh, plus

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Uh, heating is equal to temperature change

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
If you are a gas

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Because it will expand

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
So

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
So you have to add

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The effect of expansion

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Uh

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
That

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
The balloon we just talked about

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
That balloon

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
It's actually not heated

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
So in this process

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
It's actually

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
The temperature reduction in the process of ascension will be equal to

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Uh, the change in pressure

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
So

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Look at this picture on the right

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
We assume that there is a 25

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
The balloon of degree C

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
That balloon

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Because it is

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Because it is a balloon

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So it won't have a quality exchange with the outside world

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
You won't have

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Uh, the air outside runs in

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
You won't have

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
The air inside runs out

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Then it won't have heat exchange

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I won't pass the heat out

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Go outside

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And the heat outside

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Won't pass in

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
So

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
This balloon

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
In the process of rising and falling

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
In the process of rising

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It will

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Its temperature will decrease

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Its volume will expand

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
If the balloon moves down above

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
It is

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
The balloon will be compressed

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Then the volume will shrink

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Then the temperature will rise

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
That

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
This is a

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Is the atmosphere

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
It's a

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Theorem or we use this concept to push us

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
To understand that

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Hey, what is this atmosphere like?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Uh, I just talked about

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
What I just said is that

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Hey, our atmosphere is actually layered

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
That is, each layer of atmosphere

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
In fact, it has

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
It has a temperature

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So how do we measure this temperature?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Uh

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Uh, is the atmosphere stable?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
We

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Integrated

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Uh, the atmosphere

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Assuming it is stable

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And then integrate the first law of thermodynamics that we just used

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
We can actually deduce

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
A thing called

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Uh, it's right here

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And this thing on top is

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I was given

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
I was shown to my friends

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I was shown to people who were interested in the equation

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Then I won't go into the equation room to talk too much

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
That

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Why is this value important?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
We can see that it is the middle line

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
This cloud

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
He

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Oops

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
He

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
His concept is that our atmosphere is stable

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
If it goes up by 1 km

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Down 9.8 degrees

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
That's a bit like saying

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
If we have a 30 degree C balloon on the surface today

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Then this balloon

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
When we move it to 2000 meters

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
It will drop 20 degrees

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
So it's 10 degrees

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
When it goes up to 4,000 meters

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
It will drop another 20 degrees

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
So he is

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Negative 10 degrees

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
That's it

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Uh, vertical distribution

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
That's what we just talked about

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
The first law of thermodynamics tells us

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
The result is that in the same process

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
The balloon

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
It's going up 2,000 meters, going down 10 degrees, and then it's going to explode

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
And then it goes down

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
It will go up another 2,000 meters, it will go down another 20 degrees

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
And then it will explode again

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What about the idea he told us?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
That's the other two

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
That is, uh, if I say

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Today's temperature drops slower

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
For example, this case on the left

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It's 30 degrees on the surface

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's 15 degrees at 2,000 meters

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That means this case is stable

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Because if I put

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
30 degrees of this

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
It's the balloon at 30 degrees on the surface

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
If you move it up 2,000 meters

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It will be 10 degrees

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
So it will be colder

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
But my environment is

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Uh, 15 degrees

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
So the colder air

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Relatively hot air

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
It will sink

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So the case on the left is stable

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Because you move 30 degrees to 2,000 meters

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
It will be 10 degrees

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So the environment is 15 degrees

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
So this air will sink

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It's relatively stable

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Then we are more interesting

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Of course it's the case on the other side

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's the temperature it drops

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
It's every 2,000 meters

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
The drop in temperature is more than 20 degrees

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
It's the case on the right

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It's 30 degrees to 2,000 meters

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
It will drop 25 degrees

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Then go back to this value reduction rate

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Just the middle line

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I found out that this is

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
10 degrees

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
But if I drop 25 degrees

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It means 25 degrees

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
That is

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
The air I moved up

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
In fact, it is relatively light

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
So it will continue to run up

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
What about this structure

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
It's actually unstable

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
That means

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Uh, if I

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Over this value reduction rate

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It's the temperature that drops more

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
It's unstable

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Um, let me think about it

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Uh, here we are

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's the idea of stability and instability

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
This idea is in the atmosphere

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
If we only consider dry air

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It has a dry straight line

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
The one in the middle is my reference state

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
It's a relatively stable state

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Then you just have to be

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
More stable than reference state

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
It's more stable

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
It's more stable than reference

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It will be adjusted to

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's reference state

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Let's go to the next page

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Next page

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Here is a more common one

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It's a common concept in the atmosphere

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
It's called temperature

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
It's actually

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
If it's in a more common field

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
In a more common scientific field

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
We will use

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
That's the natural

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
That natural injury

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
But here we don't have to talk about

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
How to reverse injury operation

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
The concept we want to use is

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
If we don't give

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
If we don't heat up our system

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Then his injury will be stable

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
that

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
We say temperature or injury is stable

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Uh, conservative

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
In fact, it means

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Hey, we didn't heat it up

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
No quality exchange

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
In fact, it is conservative

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Then you can go back to the picture of that page

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Just the picture of that page

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
After we calculate its temperature

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
In fact, you can get a

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
A simpler concept is

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
If my temperature

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
On each vertical layer

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
It's all

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
If it's a constant

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Then the air on this layer is stable

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's neutral

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It's neutral

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Then if its

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Temperature increases with height

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
For example, the one on the left

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It was 30 degrees, 15 degrees and negative 5

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It is 303 308

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
And 313

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Its absolute temperature increases with the water

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
It means that this layer is stable

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
That's the other side

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It's on the right

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Its temperature decreases with height

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
That's not stable

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Okay, this one

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
This is a

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
It's kind of a good idea

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
We can know right away

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
that

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
The atmosphere is

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
That is, if we know its temperature

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
We can know right away

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That is, if we know its temperature

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
We can know right away

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The whole thing is stable or not

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
That

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
We are in

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
In everyday life

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Or when we just observed the balloon

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
We just know

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
We're going to convert it back to its temperature

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Most of the time

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
The air is stable

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Because it's all

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
It's the middle or the left side of this case

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Because if it's unstable

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It will have a flow and then let

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
The hot air goes up and the cold air comes down

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Then it will go back to

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Stable state

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
This is a bit like

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
As long as

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
As long as we have bad guys

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Then the bad guys will be

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Be

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Everyone is trained to be a better person

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
In this way, in the end

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
In our environment

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You'll see more

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
It's all stable

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
This state

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
it is good

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
it is good

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Wait a minute

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, this one

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I want to ask a question

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I want to ask a question

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Okay, I think I think

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I think this is a good one

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I think this is a good one

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
That cutting point is

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
If you have any questions here

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
If you have any questions here

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I think we can

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Pause

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Pause

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Okay, I'm just asking a very

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Okay, I'm just asking a very

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It should be

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
This is the professional field

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I think it's a boring question

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
This is the 303 you talked about

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
308 313k

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
This is SETA

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
This is SETA

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
OK

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Sorry

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
This is the so-called temperature, right?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Yes, it is the so-called temperature

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
But actually we are in

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
This is what we often use in the field

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Using kelvin

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Use absolute temperature to express

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
This why I use absolute temperature

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
The reason is because

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It can be different from the temperature

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Such

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yes

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Its unit is

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Use

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Yes

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Use temperature to express temperature

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
OK

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
it is good

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Just up

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Just up to this point

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
The concept is that it is

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Uh

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's not

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
It's not water

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
it is good

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
After the water is involved

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
The problem will become more complicated

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Then we can know that

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
In the balloon just now

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
If we catch it now

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
In the air of the earth

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It will have gas oxygen carbon dioxide

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Then it will also have water

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
That's why

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
For example, people living in the United States

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
It will feel that the air is dry

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Because its water may be less

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
People in Taiwan

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I feel that there is more water

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Is the abundance of water

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
In fact, in addition to affecting the comfort of our life

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
In addition

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
It will also affect the stability of the atmosphere

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
The picture on the right

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
It was also caught by me in Wikipedia

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
This thing is

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
This story is like this

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Uh

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
We are in the process of atmospheric vertical movement

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
In the process of atmospheric vertical movement

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
The temperature will be

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
The temperature will be reduced

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
In the process of temperature reduction

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
He will encounter a situation

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
The temperature is low

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
The water will freeze

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It's a bit like we're in the air

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
It's a bit like the state of fog

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
that is

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
If the air cools down quickly

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
That water

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Uh

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The water is the water

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The frozen water pressure is on the right

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Will

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Will

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Will let the steam

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Become

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Atmospheric water

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That process

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh he

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
He is not linear

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
He needs a more complicated formula to calculate

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Then this process is actually more

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
It's more difficult to capture

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's more difficult to understand

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
That's it

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So when we think about water

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Just mentioned earlier

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
The process of stability

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
There is a new one

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
There is a new interpretation

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
That is, when water becomes steam

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
When it becomes steam

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It will release some heat

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
What about the first law of thermodynamics we just learned

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
There will be one

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
There will be a heating on our right

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
On the right

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
So our up and down adjustment process

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Also add

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
The adjustment of the heat of the water

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Then we can get another one

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It's the ratio of cooling

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It's the ratio of cooling when there's water

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
He usually calls us this

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
It's called visual heat reduction rate

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
That is, you can imagine that he is

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Moisture lapse rate

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
When there is water

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
We have another cooling rate

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Then his cooling rate is more

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Smaller

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
It's just dry

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
It drops by 9.8 degrees per kilometer

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
But when you have water

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
It only drops by about 6 degrees per kilometer

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Then there is a thing here

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Just a little reminder

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Uh 9.8

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Just that 9.8 degrees

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Because the formula he calculated is a constant

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
So

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Uh

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
It won't change with the height

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
That visual heat reduction rate

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
This 6.5 is a estimate value

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It's a non-linear value

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
So you can think about this company is so complicated

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Then it will change with the height

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So 6.5 is a kind of estimate value

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Then follow

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
With different heights

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It has different

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
The gradient

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Then in the process

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
We can at the same time

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Define another temperature

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Is related to

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Water

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
This temperature is called

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Uh, relative temperature

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Relative temperature

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Relative temperature is also

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
You can think of it as a wet temperature

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
After adding water vapor

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
He can get the result

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
That

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Because the water vapor is really complicated

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Then we can see that

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
It's wet

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
The relative temperature equation is here

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Then I don't have to explain

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
What's in it

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
But he

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
It is a fairly complicated value

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Very complicated calculation

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
But if we calculate

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
After this relative temperature value

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
He actually

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
The concept of application will be quite simple

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
it is good

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
it is good

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Then

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Next we want to introduce

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Is that we want to introduce

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
When there is water vapor

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
The atmosphere will have a

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Another state occurs

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
It is called

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Unstable condition

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
That

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Uh, what about this picture

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
If we don't look

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Don't look at this part of the unstable condition

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Just look at this

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
The part of the dry heat dissipation rate

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
We can go back to just

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Just review

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
The result we just got

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
If our cooling rate

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Uh, this gamma is its cooling rate

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
must

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
that is

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
This symbol is upside down

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
That is, we are lower than the temperature

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
If the temperature of the dry heat dissipation rate is more than

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Or if our temperature is

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
If the water level is low, this

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
This is our atmosphere

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Unstable

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Then what if

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Uh, the other condition is

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
If our atmosphere is

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
More than this

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
If the cooling rate is lower

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It is stable

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
So on the other side

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Relatively stable

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Uh, this side

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
it is good

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
But when we have water vapor

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
After considering

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
What about

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
What about

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
We have another condition

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Unstable occurrence

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
The situation in the unstable condition is

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Uh, it's in the cooling rate

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's in

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Uh, let me see

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's in the middle of negative 9.8 to negative 6.5

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Because there's a negative sign here

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
So it's

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm easy to get this wrong

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I was right

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I just

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Ten minutes before the start

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Ten minutes to change the first film

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I changed it wrong

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
So here's a condition

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
The unstable situation is

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
In the middle

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Its atmosphere is actually

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Unstable

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Then it will adjust to

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
To this stability

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
That is to say

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
If it has water vapor

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Or if it has

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
If it has water vapor

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
It will be

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Unstable conditions

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It will produce flow

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
What about the formula for its judgment

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
In fact, you can see

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Imagine that it is the temperature

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Is increasing with the height

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
But its

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Relatively low temperature is decreasing with the height

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
That's the case

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
In fact, it meets

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Unstable

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
The conditions

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Uh

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Uh, good

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm going to

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm going to

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I'm going to

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm going to

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm going to

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm going to

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm not sure if this is a very complicated

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
The idea

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
But we go to the next page

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
This idea will be relatively useful

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Ok, now we finally have to see

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
What is the heat generation

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
What about the heat generation

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Its situation is

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
If we are on a ocean

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
This ocean will absorb radiation from the sun

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And then it will heat our surface

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And then there's another thing

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
When a object has temperature

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
It will have long-wave radiation

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
A lot of radiation

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
The radiation goes out

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Will send the heat out

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
So it will produce a

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Is

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
System

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Then there will be heat coming in and heat going out

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
And then

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Uh, we only rely on radiation

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Its heat cannot be adjusted to a stable state

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So it will have a flow to help

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
The whole atmosphere is adjusted

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
That's our

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Uh, the story

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Simplified, simplified, simplified version

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Of course, in the atmosphere

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It will have

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
The difference in the ocean

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And then it will have different

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Uh, background

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Atmospheric circulation

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
And then it will have

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Maybe there are a lot of people doing air glue

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Uh, there will be different physical phenomena

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Will affect

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's the change of the heat generation

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But what I'm talking about here is a bit like his

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Is that you can do everything

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Ignore the parts that can be ignored

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
What you can get is

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
This system I just talked about

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
That right

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
This is a picture from the textbook

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
What it describes is

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Its y-axis is the height

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Then its x-axis is from 90 degrees south to 90 degrees north

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
So it's a

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Uh, I put every

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
The upper temperature of the latitude is

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Average value

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
So this is the latitude above

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Then the following is the latitude

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Then we can see the latitude value

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
It's just that it's not very clear

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
But its latitude

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
In fact, it is increased by the height of the water, so it means that

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
We are in the channel or in the heat generation atmosphere

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
The temperature is increased by the height of the water

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Which

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Uh, in line with what we just saw

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
This condition

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The temperature is increased by the height of the water

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
What about the following picture

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Is quite low temperature

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Then we can see that in the heat generation area

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
In fact, it's all the same value

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
It means

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
In the heat generation atmosphere

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Its relative temperature is actually

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
A constant is a constant with the height

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That means most of the time it is maintained

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
In a state that has just been adjusted

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Or it's a neutral state

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
There must be a process

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
In the process is

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Uh, solar heating or other non-thermal processes

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Put

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
This atmosphere becomes unstable

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Then it is adjusted by the flow

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Stable

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Then this picture tells us that in fact

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
This flow is in

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
It is very common in the heat generation atmosphere

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
It's just that it's a very common phenomenon

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
That's why

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
My research is to study the process of wet flow

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
How is it

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
it is good

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
The next page is

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Uh, this page is

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I call it magic step

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Just

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Uh, we want to understand this system

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
But the atmosphere system is actually very complicated

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
I just said

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
If you want to consider everything

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
You want to consider

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
You want to consider

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Uh, water, you want to consider B, you want to consider rain, you want to consider radiation

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
All this process you will

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You will write out a super complicated

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Mathematical model

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Then you will

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
A super complicated fluid model, you have to consider the density, you have to consider all kinds of changes

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
But I actually went back to it

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm in the traditional flow problem

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Plus

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
A simplified state equation

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
To describe that if today

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Produce

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
When it is saturated

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
How will its heat release change?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
This simple equation

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Replaced by a very complicated thermal equation

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Or replaced by a very complicated

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
The process of microphysis is to simplify everything

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Simplify to me

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's only saturated and then it's unstable

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
In this state

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
To write out

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
This equation

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Give

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Give

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It's just a little bit more information

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
This time it's not a fluid

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It's just that it's simplified like this

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Then it is driven by buoyancy

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
The whole system

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Then we

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Uh, this

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
This, this is to use the temperature and the relative temperature to adjust its buoyancy

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
That

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That's not it

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
This is not

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
This is not the original form in my original paper

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But it's very close

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
We can look at that form

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Then he also

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
For super super good people in thermodynamics

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
This is not a very exact

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
This is not

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
A very exact equation

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
and so

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
If you need more details

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That's what we'll discuss later

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Then why can we do this

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Why can we do this equation

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Can help us understand

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
It should be said

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Or what kind of simplification did I do?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
That's what we just said

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
The atmosphere is actually on the ocean

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Then he has the top of the fluid

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Then he is

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
There is no lid on the top of the fluid

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But I put the fluid in two lids

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Oops

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Put it in two lids

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Then I add

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Plus the process of condensation

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Then I add the unstable

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
This fluid

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Unstable conditions

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
This condition is not a condition

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Unstable condition

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
This state

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I gave him a relatively low temperature

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Then he is

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
The low temperature is greater than zero

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Give him this condition

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Then if it meets some conditions

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
It will produce

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
That is, it will be saturated and release heat

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Simply put

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Inside my model

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
If it is saturated, it will go

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Its buoyancy is determined by its relative low temperature

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
So it is unstable

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
If I say my model

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I judge it is

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
It is stable without saturation

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
So this

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
To some extent

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It meets the condition of instability

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
This state is

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Stable without saturation

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Stable with saturation

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Then this

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
What about such a fluid

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
In fact, it will

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It needs a distribution

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
It won't be a

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
It's me today

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Just pull a balloon up

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
I know that there is saturation here

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
There is no saturation here

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
It will be a

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
It is

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
It will be a

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Distribution

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Some places have flow

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Some places have no flow

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
It is going down

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Some places are going up

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Then there is an animation on the bottom page

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
This is my simulation animation

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Then I think this animation can give you some

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The idea is to know

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
What is this flow

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
That's the same as if

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
This is the same as what we know

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
The atmosphere model is quite similar

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Or if it is

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
A little bit like the weather phenomenon we know

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
At the beginning I gave some

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Just random perturbation

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Then after a while

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
It will have a flow

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
In this process

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
By the way, let me describe

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
What is my model

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
This is my

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
The equation above me just now

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Is to use

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Uncompressible package

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Uncompressible program to

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Solve the above equation

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Then this

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
The program is

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Can have

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Is adaptive mesh

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I'm not sure what to say

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
It can be mesh

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Detailed to

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Can have dynamic mesh

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Then it is in

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Ccse developed by Perkin Lab

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Then if

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
For those of you who have studied the numerical method

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
It is the numerical method of

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
The

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Then

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Solve

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Under the condition that it is uncompressible

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
We use approximate projection

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Is to use a method to solve

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Just

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Solve this limitation of uncompressible flow

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Then we can see

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
This is the addition of rotation

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
So

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
So after a while

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Numerical simulation

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Then the random flow we just talked about

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Will become

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It's like a typhoon

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
This kind of spiral

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
What about this spiral

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
In fact, it is

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
There are many similar places to typhoons

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Then it will

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
It will also die

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Then it will grow a new flow

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Then it has

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Is that it has an upper and lower layer

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
We can talk about the upper layer area

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
The upper layer area is the typhoon

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That lower layer area is

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's just that there is no water here

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
The place is its lower layer area

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
That

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
This simplified model

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I'm not sure if I can convince everyone

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
It is to some extent

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Captured a lot of atmospheric features

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
That

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
We use

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
To understand this simplified model

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
To understand that

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
The original atmosphere

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Or what is the atmosphere

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Come

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Come and do further research

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
That

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Let's go to the next page

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I haven't jumped to the next page yet

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Then we have some more

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Simple

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
It should be said that it is not simple

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Anyway, it is more

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Uh

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
A more static picture to see

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Look at what my simulation results tell us

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Or

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
What are these things

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Is related to atmospheric

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Similar

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
That

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The two on the left are

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Uh

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
A time screenshot

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
That left

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Uh

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
What about this A picture

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It is not

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
No rotation

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
The right one has rotation

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Then we can see that there is no rotation

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
It will have

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Is the ascending area

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
There are some currents in

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
In

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
In

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Inside my simulation area

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Then there is another place

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Is the descent area

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
This way

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Then the other side of the picture is

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I put the rotation into my

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
In the simulation conditions

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
It will produce a vortex like a typhoon

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Good

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
You will see a few

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Several such

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Vortex

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Okay, then I put these vortexes

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Go to the mirror

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
Is to do

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Along its

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Half into the average

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
We can see a lot

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Some features like typhoons

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Let's take a look at the above

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
This picture

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
It is

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
It is

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
The color is the vertical speed

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
So it will have

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The speed of the center rise

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
It will also have

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
There is a descent in the center

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
It's a bit like a typhoon

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Typhoon eye

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
The other one

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Is contour

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Its horizontal line

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Is

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
The content of liquid water

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
So it rises in the center

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
There are more liquid water

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
So this is like us

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
I don't understand typhoons

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
We have also seen the satellite image of typhoons

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Is in the center of the typhoon

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
There will be a lot of clouds

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
There will be a lot of water and a lot of rain

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
So this is to some extent

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Close to our understanding of typhoons

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
What about the next one

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Is

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Uh, it's a typhoon

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Mirror wind and oblique wind

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Is

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
There is a lower layer

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
The color is the mirror wind

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
It has

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
The lower layer is from the outside

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Into the typhoon center

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
The wind

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Then it will decrease with the height

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It will fly out from the upper layer

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
The upper layer flows out

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Then this is accompanied by

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Is the oblique wind

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
That this

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
In the atmosphere

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
It meets some

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Uh, what is this

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Is the slope wind

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
The slope wind

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
What is the slope wind

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Is the slope wind

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
The

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
The

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
The model is like this

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
What about the third picture

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
It is

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Uh, it's quite unsteady

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
With its angular momentum

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
That in

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
There is a famous paper in the atmosphere

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It has a narrative

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Say it is

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
A narrative

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Uh, an ideal spiral

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Its angular momentum

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
With its relative unsteady

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
To some extent

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Just his

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
The line must be relatively parallel

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
That

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
In this result

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
In this part

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
It is also relatively parallel

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
So it means that this spiral

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It is with

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
It is quite similar to the ideal typhoon model

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
it is good

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
it is good

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
This is the last picture with information

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
This picture is also a little bit complicated

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
But

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Uh, I think the reason I want to show this picture is because

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Because we talked about so much in the front

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Wei Wen talked so much about injury

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
That this picture is actually the concept of application injury

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
To divide my level

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
That is, I put the injury of each level

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Every block of different injuries

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Collected

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Then go and say

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
My

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
The atmosphere of my different injuries

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
In the end, the blocks of different injuries

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
How is it distributed

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Okay, what about this one above?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
The above one is

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Uh, its distribution

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
There is a white line here

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
If you can see it, it is

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
It is

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Uh, the condensation line

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
That is, if I am in

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
The upper right of this line represents these air

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Is condensed

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
These blocks are condensed

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Then there is no condensation below

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Then we can find out

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
In

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
If there is no rotation

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Inside the case is

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Uh, this

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
This kind of

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Under this state

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Most of it

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
The air is not condensed

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Then there will be a small part of it

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Is condensed

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Uh, the condensed air is relatively small

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Then

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
In addition, if there is a spiral

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
It has more

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Less proportion

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
There will be an upward spiral

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Then there are more parts of the lower layer

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
So its upper layer

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
The upper and lower layers are more open

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
This is the lower layer area

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Then this is the upper layer area

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Then there is no

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
The upper layer area without rotation is here

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
So its upper and lower

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
The upper and lower areas can be separated

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Then below this is a

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
In uh

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
A fairly low temperature

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
It can distinguish its upper and lower

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
What is it like in a vertical movement

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
that

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Uh, when there is a rotation

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
His upper body is

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
More will not be

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Uh environment to

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Mix is if he

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
It should be said that his upper body movement is better protected

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
So his upper body

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
It's just that his heat transmission efficiency is

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
More effective

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Then this

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
This way of analysis is actually

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Is a

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
I think it's a bit smart

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
No, it's not

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Because this is not my way

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
This is my boss's way

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
He provided everyone with a

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Provided everyone with a

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
To understand from the point of view of injury

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Hey, what about our big team

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
that

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Cut back on the idea at the beginning

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Just when i have

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Something with a bigger benefit

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Or something with a bigger injury

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
When the block is running up

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
That

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
The smaller block of the injury is running down

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
But he has one

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Is relatively wet

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
The air block has more potential to run up

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Relatively dry block

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
He just runs down

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
This picture tells us to some extent

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
This thing

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Okay, today

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
I think my sharing is probably here

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Then there are a few things to remind everyone

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Is lapse rate

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Is

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
The value reduction rate is directly affected

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Directly related to our climate change

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Is if you

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Just said

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
If these things don't make sense to you

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Then we can still go back to one thing

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
That is, lapse rate is actually

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Our background

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Our

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Stability

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Our physical structure is there

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
He won't change because of climate change

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Add two degrees

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
That

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
So

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Lapse rate is really

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Directly related to climate change

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Then the second thing is

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Uh

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Just now we talked about heat and air

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Is a relatively complex process

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Is that he has

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Various things

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Then the stability of light is so complicated

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
You can imagine

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
If we consider all kinds of different physics

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
For example, consider radiation

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Consider microphysics

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Consider gas

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
How complicated it can become

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Then I will

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
My research is counterproductive

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I will take all these complicated things

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Take it all

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Then

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
After simplifying this mode

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Then use numerical simulation

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
To solve

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
To

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
To solve this equation

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
To understand that this

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Rise and fall

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
How to distribute

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Then this mode

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
He has another advantage

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Is that he can make it soundless

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
The analysis becomes simpler

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
That

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Of course I don't want to talk about this today

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
This part

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
But it is

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Is a simplified mode

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Then he can give us a lot

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Different information

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Then the last one

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Take home message is

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Uh, wet flow

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
The thing is

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Wet things go up

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Dry things come down

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
That uh

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
In case this

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
This sentence doesn't make sense

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
It doesn't make sense to everyone

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Is that we have a cloud

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
The place is rising

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Then there are many places

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
It's downstream

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
It's downstream

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
The place is much more than the place that rises

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Then this is a feature of wet flow

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
That

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Uh, maybe some friends who do flow

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
He will say

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
His flow is

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
The rise and fall are symmetrical

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
That wet flow is

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
It's not symmetrical

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And the wet flow has a very clear boundary

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Cut up the rise and fall

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
The more you cut

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Your wet flow

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Then my speech is here

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Then thank you very much

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Thank you for coming

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Then thank you very much

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Friends who helped me watch the video

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
such

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Thank you for your speech

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Thank you

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Is there anyone here who wants to ask questions?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Anyway, everyone can ask directly

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You can chat directly

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Yes yes yes yes yes

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
I have a question

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Hello

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Hi

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
That you just said

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
This thing

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
With your temperature

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
In the case of climate change

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Um

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Is it that it won't change?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Wet flow will not change

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
It's kind of like you're getting warmer

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
But your wet flow rate is still there

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
That is, it

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The wet flow rate comes from the physics equation

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
It won't change because of your temperature increase

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's kind of like

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Like first derivative

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
That is, you are dividing

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
To determine its gradient

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
That's it

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
This is my understanding

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
I don't know

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
I instinctively think

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I don't quite agree with this sentence

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
because

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Our atmosphere

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Unless you are an ideal atmosphere

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
It's dry

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Of course it's dry and hot

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Yes

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Especially in hot areas

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
There is water

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
The water will change as the climate changes

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Yes

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
So you are in the atmosphere

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
The distribution of water will also change in the atmosphere

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Yes

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
I think I think

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
When there is wet

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
The thing when it's wet is

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
It's different

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I agree

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That is, if there is

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
The process of water

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
This thing is completely different

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Yes

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Yes

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It should be said that this is why

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
This is why

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Wet flow is very complicated

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
So why

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Why do I want to simplify this model

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
To see

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
If I only look at

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Only look at

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Only look at the simplified

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
The buoyancy structure

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
What will it be

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Will

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
What are the different things

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
OK

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Then I think this sentence should

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Your take-home message

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
The first sentence should be

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
The dry

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Left side

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Dry right

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
It won't change

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Yes

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
It's a major issue

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Yes

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
So it's dry

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
It won't change

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
But if it's visual

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
If it's hot

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Yes

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
It will change

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Yes

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
That's right

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
No change

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Then we can go back to your

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Is that the projection of the simplified model just now?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
it is good

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Come here

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yes

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Ah

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So your model is

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Assuming

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
In a

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
In an unstable environment

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
That's right

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Then

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Ah

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
If

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
In the process of a block rise

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
As long as it

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Fluid

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
As long as its water reaches

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The amount of water that can hold its temperature

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Yes

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
It will be condensed

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Yes

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
When the condensation occurs

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Ah

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
In fact

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
In fact

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
It's not that complicated

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
I'm just thinking

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
I'm just thinking

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
This is the 1960s

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
That

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
That

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
You know that very simple

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
That one

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
What's the difference in flow parameters?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
I

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
I think

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
I think it's a bit

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I'll just talk about my concept

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
It's just

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It's actually a little bit simpler than you just said

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I think

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
I think it's a little bit simpler than what I just said

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Because my

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I give my

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
The upper and lower boundaries are actually in a state of saturation

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Then

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Ah

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Then

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
There is a condition that I just mentioned

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
If it is saturated

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
There is a buoyancy below

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
This equation

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
In fact, it is

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
It is

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
If it is saturated

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
It is the visual heat

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
If it is not saturated, it is the dry heat

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
The process of dry heat

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
So it's actually

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
It's actually not that I

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
It makes it easier to judge the saturation

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
It's so simple that there's only one maximum to judge this thing

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
So

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Then

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Then what do I want to do?

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Then

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Because the boundary conditions are fixed over there

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's not like I'm giving it

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
It's not like the traditional atmospheric mode

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I'm giving the temperature to the humidity

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
The volume to decide

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Hey, my atmospheric mode is exactly what I gave

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
How many

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Things are in the mode

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
In fact, it is

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
I

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
It's a bit like I'm giving

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm giving

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Then I give

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
In fact, I am giving benefits

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It was originally written with benefits

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
This is why I want to do benefits in the first page

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
It is

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Use benefits to drive the whole mode

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Then I give the volume of benefits to decide

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Hey, it's not stable

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And then in the case of instability

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
How do I distribute things

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You've already published this result, haven't you?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Hey

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
In the province

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I got minor revision

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
So

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
OK

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Maybe I'll have to look for it later

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
To understand the details

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Yeah, I think we can

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Hey, will you go to that?

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Hurricane Conference

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Which one is it?

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Hey

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
May

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
The beginning of May is the Tropical Meteorology

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay, let's talk about it then

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
OK

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Thank you

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Yeah, this one

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
This

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
I think it's

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
He simplified

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Too many things

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
With

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
He even

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
He even

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Should be

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Just

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
He is much more simplified than the cloud

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
such

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Is there any problem here?

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
If not

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
I can ask

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Just on this picture

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
why

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
I want to understand

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
This is Tropical Meteorology

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Why are the upper and lower boundaries saturated?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You have to calculate it as saturated

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Calculated as saturated

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Isn't it raining already?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Hey

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Hey

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Hey

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Hey

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Isn't it raining already?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Hey

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Hey

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Hey

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Hey

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Hey

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Is it Rainy here?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Hey

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Hey

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Hey

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Hey

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Hey

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Hey

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The floor

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Hey

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Hey

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Hey

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
It's raining

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
So it's a bit like

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Because it can simplify a little bit of the problem

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
So let it become a little bit more simplified

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Then

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Another more practical reason

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Is that we found out in the previous research

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
If the lower boundary is saturated and the upper boundary is not saturated

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Its stability is actually relatively stable

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
It will be stable in the end

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Then its simulation is relatively boring

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
It won't have a stable flow

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
So why do we set the upper and lower boundaries to be stable

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
One reason is that it can produce a more interesting result

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Then another reason is that it can simplify

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
It can simplify what we are doing

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
It can reduce a variable when it is analyzed five times

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Sorry

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Because I don't understand at all

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
So what I want to understand is

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
This is more in line with the actual physical situation

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
The bottom is the sea

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Then the top

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
The bottom sea is saturated

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
This I seem to understand

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Yes yes yes

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Then the top

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
It's actually not that consistent

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
To be honest, it's not that consistent

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
But

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
But I should say that I can add a little more

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
The reason it is consistent is

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
If you look at this cloud

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
If it goes up to the top

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
To some extent

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
If there is a cloud, it is still relatively saturated

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
So if the upper boundary is saturated

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
It didn't lose too much

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Is related to what we originally assumed

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
If there is still a cloud on it

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It is basically saturated

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Of course, in the real atmosphere, it is the top of the stream

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Its water volume is relatively difficult

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Through the top of the stream to the bottom of the stream

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Of course, you should say that in this situation

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
If there is a lot of water on the top of the stream

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
There are a lot of clouds like this

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
In fact, it is not too far from the saturation

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
So in fact, having a cloud means that it is already close to saturation

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
It should be said that there is a cloud

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
In fact, it is called that it is over-saturated

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
It will produce clouds

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
The process of the water vapor that I just omitted is

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
When I reach the saturation condition

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
In fact, many times

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Its water droplets will not freeze

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It still needs to freeze

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Water will freeze

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Drops

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Then we have here

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
In fact, there is an assumption that I did not mention

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
It is assumed that

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Water is produced as soon as it reaches saturation

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
In fact, this is done

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Many people in the micro-physical process

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
They will not make this assumption

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh understand

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
Then I still have one more thing to understand today

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I'm sorry, I have a lot of questions

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Recently all asked

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Because my question should be more obvious

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I'll ask him first

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
The first one is why

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
Your atmospheric simulation is incompressible fluid

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
In fact, this is also a very good question

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Because in atmospheric

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
When we just talked about the cloud mode

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It actually does not use incompressible

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
But it will use an elastic

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It will make the density vertical

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
This situation

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
That is

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
But it is basically incompressible

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
If you do

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
When that compressible analysis

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
You will find that the compressible amount

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
In the system

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Can

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
The contribution is very small

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
So it contributes less than

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
10-2

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So this result is what we do

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Because when you do

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
When you go to do compressible fluid

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
The price you need is very high

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
For example, your time step will become very small

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Then what you can solve becomes a lot less

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
So rather than

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Spend a long time

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
To do

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Compressible to do that simple calculation

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Why don't we take this compressible

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
We can do a longer time

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
So a lot of atmospheric

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
These discussions

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Are all using incompressible

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Gas?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
They have

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
This is also a good question

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
When doing incompressible

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
In fact, there are different levels of incompressible

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Some people's incompressible

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Is divergent u is equal to 0

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Then some people's incompressible

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Is

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Divergent rho u is equal to 0

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Is that it puts density

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Vertically distributed

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
This phenomenon

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
What is u?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
u is

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Speed is its three-dimensional speed

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Its speed

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Has

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
The density has

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
This is the second

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Relatively complicated

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Then there is

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
There is also

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Divergent u is equal to

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Its

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Incompressibility

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Related to the release of heat

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
This is a little more complicated

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Then there is

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
If you say

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Its

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Related to heat

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
This is usually called pseudo-compressible

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
So it will have different levels of simplification

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Of course, the more you consider

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
The more difficult your numerical model is

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Never thought

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Gas can use incompressible

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
To consider

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
It has a little bit

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
It should be said that if you really use compressible

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
You can do a lot of things

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Then

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
In fact, after talking about compressible

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It has more simplification

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
If your model is

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Hydrostatic

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Accurate

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
If you do it

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Will simplify more

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
The time you can simulate is longer

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
But of course it is

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
You take this advantage

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
You have to sacrifice something

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Then in my question

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Its problem is not very good

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
It is a large area of ​​level

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
But its vertical movement is very important

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
So this is why

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Choose such a simulation

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It will choose

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
For example, its horizontal grid

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Is 1km x 1km

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
But its vertical may be a few hundred meters

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
The last one I want to know

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Why

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Stable

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Corresponds to

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
There is a video in front of you

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Adiabatic process

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It means it is stable

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Do you want to talk about this?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
This

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Adiabatic

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
My understanding is thermal

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
What does it have to do with stable?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Let me think about it

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
If it is

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
In fact, we have

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Equation

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
We put hydrostatic plus

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Adiabatic process

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
We deduce the lapse rate

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
If you have hydrostatic plus

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Hydrostatic plus

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Add that

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Adiabatic

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
You will get this dry lapse rate

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
In dry lapse rate

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Your block can move up and down

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Then it won't

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Its movement is the same as the adiabatic process

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Is consistent

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
If your vertical distribution

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Is the distribution of the adiabatic process

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Then it is up and down

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
In neutral state

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I moved block A to block B

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I found that these two blocks are the same

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It means it won't

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Change position

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
It won't run away

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
It means it is relatively neutral

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
But if you run to stable

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
In stable case

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
You exchange blocks

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
It will return to its original position

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
It means it is stable

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Dry lapse rate is a

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Criterion

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
If you are more than dry lapse rate

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
It will become more unstable

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
So

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
If you are less than dry lapse rate

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
It is relatively stable

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
So lapse rate is like

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Stress hole

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
If you are less than this stress hole

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It is unstable

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It is stable

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
So you mean

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
When in a stable case

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
You just

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Take a piece of air from the sky

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Its

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It will float

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
It is the same

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
If it is dry lapse rate

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
It is the same

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
You have a profile

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
If it is dry lapse rate

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
If you take a normal air

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Because it is stable

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So you take an air from the sky

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
You wrap it with a balloon

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Because when it comes down

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It will compress

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It will compress into a smaller air

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
When you bring it to the ground

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Because it passed the cooling process

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Its cooling will be more

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Because it is stable

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
The air will float

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
The air will float

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
You mean

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
The condition is

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
You

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
You put

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
15°C

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Put it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
200

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
2 km

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Its buoyancy is equal to 0

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
These two things are the same

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
This can be inferred

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Yes

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
If

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Let me think

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
If you are on the lapse rate

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
The whole block

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Its buoyancy is equal to 0

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
It will not

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
It is not very good

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
It is trying to stabilize

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Its buoyancy is equal to the weight of the block

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Yes

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
This is quite interesting

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
You can look it up

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Yes

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
If

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
If your institute has a book

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
You can refer to it

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
It is called atmospheric thermodynamics

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
The series of books

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
My question is finished

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Thank you

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Is there any professional question here?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
No?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I will turn off the recording

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Thank you

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Thank you
