1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,540
Thank you everyone for coming to the speech on January 22, 2022.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,140
Today's speaker is Dr. Zheng Huaijie.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:25,800
He obtained a master's degree and master's degree from Taiwan University between 2010 and 2013,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,440
and then stayed for a while at NTU Haiyan.

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,440
Later, in 2015, he was a Ph.D. student at Cornell University's Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science.

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Last year, he obtained a Ph.D. degree and joined the research team of Fernando Perez from the University of California, Buckeye, California.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,940
He is now implementing a plan, which is the topic he is going to talk about today, the Joe Piter Meets the Earth plan.

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:06,940
He will talk about how to use these softwares in atmospheric and geoscientific applications.

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,940
Let's welcome Dr. Zheng Huaijie to give a speech.

10
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,940
Everyone can turn on the microphone to encourage our speaker.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Thank you for your introduction.

12
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,940
Let me share my screen.

13
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Can you see it?

14
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:44,940
Thank you again for your introduction.

15
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,940
Thank you for coming to listen to my speech.

16
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,940
My name is Zheng Huaijie.

17
00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:03,940
The topic I want to talk about today is the Joe Piter Meets the Earth plan I am implementing as a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.

18
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,940
I have posted a link to the video in the chat room.

19
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,940
If you are interested, you can read it yourself.

20
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,940
But what you see should be the same.

21
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,940
The main goal of this plan is to build the first software ecosystem.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,940
If you hear anything you don't understand, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,940
Because there may be some Korean words.

24
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,940
I'm not sure if you can understand.

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,940
So please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Why can't I use it?

27
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Today, in the next hour or so, I will divide the content into five parts.

28
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,940
First, I will add some things, including what I am doing now and what I was doing before.

29
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,940
How did these things lead me to this plan?

30
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,940
Before I talk about Joe Piter Meets the Earth, I will talk about what Joe Piter is.

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,940
What kind of challenges does earth science currently face?

32
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,940
Finally, we will discuss what the goal of Joe Piter Meets the Earth is and what we have accomplished so far.

33
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,940
The last part is our future prospects and plans.

34
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,940
And we see some efforts being made in the geoscience community.

35
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:36,940
My own field of research is geoscience, geophysics, earth physics, and geospatial deformation.

36
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,940
Here is a demo.

37
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,940
I will tell you what my research plan is doing.

38
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,940
You can imagine that there is an iceberg in front of you.

39
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,940
There will be some ice cracks on the iceberg.

40
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,940
As the iceberg flows, these cracks will change its position.

41
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:04,940
If you have a satellite today, you can take a picture of the iceberg every once in a while.

42
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:14,940
In this way, you can look at these pictures and calculate the movement speed of each crack on the iceberg.

43
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,940
In this way, you can calculate the movement speed of the entire iceberg.

44
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,940
This example is one of my many research plans.

45
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,940
Although most of my research plans are not complete, most of them are like this.

46
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,940
It is to use a very rich set of satellite data to monitor the changes in the ice circle.

47
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:46,940
This ice circle includes the ice on the earth, including the sea ice, and even the ice on other planets.

48
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,940
Most of these changes are physical changes.

49
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:57,940
For example, the speed of the iceberg, the change in the water time, the change in the water time of the iceberg, or other physical parameters.

50
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:07,940
These parameters have a very deep connection to the entire field of earth science, especially the field of global change.

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:18,940
When I joined Cornell in 2015, I started to put my research center on ice science.

52
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,940
I have been doing this for about 6 or 7 years.

53
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:35,940
When I was using these satellite data, I found that the scale and the amount of data we used was so huge.

54
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Traditional analysis methods sometimes seem to be less efficient.

55
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:53,940
I have been thinking about how to maintain the efficiency of analysis and academic communication while using a lot of data.

56
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,940
For me, the answer is open science.

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,940
This is the era of big data.

58
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Open science means that all the details of your research should be as open as possible to the public.

59
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,940
For example, open your data so that others can easily access it.

60
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Upload your original code or city code.

61
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
Everyone can Google your tool as long as they need it.

62
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Even when you have some research results, you can upload your research results.

63
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Whether it's a picture or a video, upload it.

64
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Even cooperate with the media to promote your research.

65
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,940
These things are all open science.

66
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Although it sounds simple, it's actually quite difficult to do.

67
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:52,940
Because you will find that when you really want to open all your things, data, city code, notes, and results, there will be some challenges.

68
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,940
These challenges are why I joined the Jupiter Meteors team and why I am doing this project now.

69
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,940
So let's talk about Jupiter first.

70
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
How much do you know about Jupiter?

71
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,940
This is a public opinion survey.

72
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,940
If you have seen the chat room, I have already posted a link.

73
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,940
You can rename or type your name.

74
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
It doesn't matter, I won't confirm.

75
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,940
But you can choose how much you know about Jupiter.

76
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Let me know about everyone's background.

77
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:38,940
It seems that everyone has heard of Jupiter.

78
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:50,940
About two-thirds of people have used Notebook or Jupiter Lab.

79
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,940
One-third of the people are using it every day.

80
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,940
It seems that everyone has a certain degree of understanding of Jupiter.

81
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Oh, I have increased to 7.3.

82
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Thank you for your vote.

83
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Everyone voted, so let's move on to the next one.

84
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
There will be other questions later, so let's move on to the next video.

85
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,940
If you want me to define what Jupiter is,

86
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:28,940
I would say that Jupiter is actually a homework system for quantum mechanics.

87
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,940
A homework system means that it can help you complete a task you want to complete.

88
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,940
Of course, your task may have a lot of different work elements.

89
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:46,940
Jupiter provides different tools to help you meet different needs in your task.

90
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Let me give you an example.

91
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Let's say you have a research idea in your mind.

92
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Then it starts to take shape.

93
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Then you start to explore.

94
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Hey, does this research idea make sense?

95
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,940
You may want to use your computer to download some data.

96
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Then write some programs to analyze.

97
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Initial analysis to see if things are what you think they are.

98
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,940
When you are sure that this project is developable,

99
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:27,940
you may want to use more resources, such as computing resources.

100
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Or you may want to find other co-authors to implement this project.

101
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
To analyze large amounts of data.

102
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Jupiter's tool is to tie all these things together.

103
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,940
So that when you are looking for data,

104
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,940
or when you are doing mass computing,

105
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,940
or when you are cooperating with others,

106
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
you can have a common platform to communicate with each other.

107
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,940
You will notice that I put IPython in the center circle.

108
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,940
This is because IPython is actually the predecessor of Jupyter.

109
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,940
IPython was designed by Fernando Pérez 20 years ago.

110
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
The original purpose was to write code.

111
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
When you are analyzing data,

112
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,940
you want to be able to present what the data looks like in real time.

113
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,940
This concept was invented with IPython.

114
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Then it gradually became popular.

115
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Now we put this project in the next generation of Jupyter.

116
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,940
When we design Jupyter,

117
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:53,940
in addition to allowing Jupyter tools to allow you to analyze data science,

118
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,940
we also have a very big goal.

119
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,940
We want to be able to communicate with others very well and efficiently

120
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,940
at any stage of the user's use of these tools.

121
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,940
For example, Jupyter Notebook is a file.

122
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
You can easily copy it to others.

123
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Then others can get the file directly.

124
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
If you have used JupyterHub,

125
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,940
it is actually like a server.

126
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,940
Everyone can log into this server as a different user.

127
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,940
They will save the same image interface.

128
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,940
This interface is based on JupyterLab.

129
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,940
On this platform,

130
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,940
they can use the same data freely.

131
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
You can develop different cities.

132
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,940
Others in your team can easily see your city

133
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
and communicate directly.

134
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
So for some people,

135
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Jupyter provides these tools

136
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,940
to promote a very good community discussion.

137
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Some people think that Jupyter actually represents

138
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,940
a community formed by people using Jupyter.

139
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Among so many tools,

140
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,940
Jupyter has a core tool called Jupyter Notebook.

141
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
It used to be called IPython Notebook,

142
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
but now it's called Jupyter Notebook.

143
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Now that you've used it,

144
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
let's jump over to it.

145
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,940
It's basically a file.

146
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,940
You can save it with a browser.

147
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,940
After saving,

148
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
you can see that

149
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
this is a professional format

150
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
for displaying text and mathematical formulas.

151
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
In the same file,

152
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
you can construct your city code.

153
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,940
You can write city code and execute it.

154
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
You can display interactive results.

155
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
You can adjust the parameters here.

156
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,940
You can see what the final image looks like.

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
The last step is

158
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,940
to simply pass the entire notebook to others

159
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,940
so that they can 100% re-study it.

160
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Here's a picture

161
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
to give you a little insight

162
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
into how Jupyter Notebook

163
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,940
achieved this goal.

164
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,940
First, when you open a notebook,

165
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,940
it's actually the notebook's service

166
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,940
that turns your computer into a server.

167
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,940
Users need to use

168
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,940
a browser and HTTP protocol

169
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,940
to store the content on the server.

170
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,940
The user's operations

171
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
on the server

172
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,940
will be recorded in the notebook file.

173
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,940
When the user needs to compute,

174
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,940
the server will call a computing core,

175
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,940
which is the kernel.

176
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,940
This core may be Python,

177
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,940
but in fact,

178
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,940
if you have a good setup,

179
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
it can also use other cores to compute,

180
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,940
such as R, C++, or even Julia.

181
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
In the most general use case,

182
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
your notebook server

183
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
is installed on your own computer.

184
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Your notebook file is also on your computer.

185
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
But we can also use the same logic

186
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
to install the server

187
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,940
on cloud computing resources

188
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
or even on HPC,

189
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,940
which is a supercomputer.

190
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
In this way,

191
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,940
these cloud computing resources

192
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
or supercomputers

193
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
can be upgraded

194
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,940
to become your data processing center.

195
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
You can directly log in

196
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
to these cloud computing resources

197
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,940
and open your program.

198
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,940
You can get or read data

199
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
and analyze it

200
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,940
directly on the same interface.

201
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
In this way,

202
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
your personal computer

203
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
is a place

204
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
where you can save

205
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,940
typing and reading results.

206
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Most of the computing

207
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
is done on the cloud.

208
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
This is what we hope to achieve

209
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,940
through Jupyter Notebook.

210
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
That's all for Jupyter.

211
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
It's very simple.

212
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Next, I'd like to ask

213
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
how well you know about

214
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
earth science.

215
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
There are five statements here.

216
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,940
They are shallow and deep.

217
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Please choose one

218
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
according to

219
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
your knowledge level.

220
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh, it seems

221
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,940
the result is a little weird.

222
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
It seems that

223
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
your knowledge about

224
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
earth science is

225
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
scattered.

226
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
It's on average

227
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,940
between A and D.

228
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Some people seem to

229
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,940
be familiar with earth science.

230
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
But some people

231
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
may not know

232
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
what we are doing now.

233
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
But it doesn't matter.

234
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Next,

235
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
I won't tell you

236
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
what earth science is.

237
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
But what I want to say is

238
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
what challenges we face

239
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
as earth scientists.

240
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
And how we can solve

241
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
these challenges

242
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
through Jupyter.

243
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Have you finished voting?

244
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
OK, let's move on

245
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,940
to the next video.

246
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
For most people,

247
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
when it comes to earth science,

248
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
you may think

249
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
it's just a group of scientists

250
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
going out into the wild.

251
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
They collect samples,

252
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
bring them back to the lab,

253
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
analyze them,

254
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
study them,

255
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
and then write a paper.

256
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
That's it.

257
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
That's right.

258
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Traditionally,

259
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,940
earth science

260
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
is basically like this.

261
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
For example,

262
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
this picture.

263
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
I took this picture

264
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
7 or 8 years ago

265
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
with a Japanese

266
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
volcanic scientist,

267
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
Shogo Kimura.

268
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
We took this picture

269
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
when we were doing

270
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
field research in a big oil pit.

271
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Traditionally,

272
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,940
there's not much information

273
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,940
about earth science.

274
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Because the information

275
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
has to be obtained

276
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
from the wild.

277
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,940
Most of the information

278
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
is written on your notebook.

279
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Just a few lines.

280
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
And then you go back

281
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
to the lab and process it.

282
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
But with the emergence

283
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
of new technology

284
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
and new methods,

285
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
for example,

286
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
like this one.

287
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
This picture,

288
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,940
although this picture

289
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
is very old,

290
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
it's already 7 or 8 years old.

291
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
But when we were

292
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
out in the wild,

293
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
we actually used

294
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
instrument support.

295
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
We wanted to measure

296
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
the temperature of the surface

297
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
of a big oil pit.

298
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
So we brought

299
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
a infrared camera.

300
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
The information

301
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,940
involved in the infrared camera

302
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
is not at all like

303
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
the information

304
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
you would write

305
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
on a wild notebook.

306
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
You will find that

307
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
this information

308
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
is already digitized

309
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
at the very beginning.

310
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
And it can provide

311
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
some information

312
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
that is continuous

313
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,940
in time and space.

314
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,940
That is to say,

315
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
the size of the data

316
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
itself

317
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
will become very large.

318
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,940
It used to be one or two strokes,

319
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
but now there are several,

320
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
just different dimensions,

321
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
and then several megabytes

322
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
or several gigabytes of data

323
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
waiting for you to analyze.

324
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
This is just

325
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
the part of the field investigation.

326
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
But now

327
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,940
we have some technology

328
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
that allows us

329
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,940
to collect data

330
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,940
without going out in the wild.

331
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
For example,

332
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,940
you can use a drone

333
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,940
or a higher-end,

334
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
or farther,

335
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
satellite data

336
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
to help you analyze

337
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,940
what is happening on Earth.

338
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,940
For example,

339
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
now,

340
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
a satellite,

341
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,940
a Earth observation satellite,

342
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
can produce

343
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
several TB of data

344
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
every day.

345
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Think about it,

346
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
we have dozens of

347
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Earth observation satellites

348
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
flying in the sky,

349
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
and then

350
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
we also observe

351
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
for a long time,

352
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
not just one day,

353
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
but also several decades,

354
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
even several years.

355
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
So,

356
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
the amount of data

357
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
added up

358
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
is so huge

359
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
that no one knows

360
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
how to deal with it.

361
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
This is a problem

362
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
that observers

363
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
will face.

364
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
On the other hand,

365
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
simulators

366
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
actually

367
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
have the same problem,

368
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
because they will say,

369
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
wow,

370
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
now I have so much data,

371
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
so I can improve

372
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
the resolution of

373
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
my Earth model.

374
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
I can analyze

375
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
for example,

376
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,940
what happened

377
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
in a few days,

378
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
a few minutes,

379
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,940
a few seconds,

380
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,940
or

381
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
what happened

382
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
in a few meters

383
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
or a few centimeters

384
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
.

385
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
Then,

386
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
they can improve

387
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
the accuracy of their models,

388
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
and then

389
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
this large amount of observation data

390
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
can be used to verify

391
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
whether their models

392
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
are accurate.

393
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
But no matter which one,

394
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,940
whether it is observed

395
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
or simulated,

396
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
you have to deal with

397
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
and analyze

398
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
such large-scale data,

399
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
you have to have

400
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
relative computing resources.

401
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
Not to mention,

402
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
there may be many types

403
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
of data

404
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
in Earth science.

405
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
For example,

406
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,940
if you are a

407
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Earth observation satellite today,

408
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
if you have a camera

409
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
installed on it,

410
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
then the data you collect

411
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
is basically

412
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
a photo,

413
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
a video,

414
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,940
a bit like a

415
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
telescope,

416
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
like this picture on the left.

417
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
It's a video,

418
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
uh,

419
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
not a video,

420
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
sorry,

421
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
a photo.

422
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
But,

423
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,940
there are also other types of data

424
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
that you may be able to collect,

425
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
for example,

426
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
you may be able to collect

427
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
some geographical space data,

428
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
and then they have

429
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
so-called,

430
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
uh,

431
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
maybe their

432
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
scattered

433
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
bit by bit

434
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
all over the place,

435
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
and maybe they can

436
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
form a certain

437
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
shape,

438
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
like a line,

439
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
or a polygon,

440
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
and so on.

441
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
What about

442
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
the different data structures?

443
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
How do you

444
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
put them together

445
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,940
and analyze them?

446
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
This is what

447
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Earth scientists

448
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
are currently

449
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
trying very hard

450
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
to solve.

451
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
And,

452
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,940
these,

453
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
and most of these

454
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
different types of data

455
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
have so-called

456
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
background data,

457
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
which is

458
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
called metadata

459
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
in English.

460
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
Uh,

461
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
its concept is,

462
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
uh,

463
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
for example,

464
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
let's make a satellite image today.

465
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
This satellite image

466
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
actually has other data,

467
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
such as,

468
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
uh,

469
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,940
which satellite shot it,

470
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,940
when was it shot,

471
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
and then,

472
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
what was the

473
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
angle of the orbit

474
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
at that time,

475
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
uh,

476
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
and other orbit parameters,

477
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
and then,

478
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
which wave

479
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
was the image taken in,

480
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
was it a visible wave,

481
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
or a infrared wave,

482
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
and so on,

483
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
and so on,

484
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
and so on.

485
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
Any data

486
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
about this image

487
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
is considered

488
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,940
background data.

489
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Now,

490
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
these background data

491
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
may not have

492
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
much impact

493
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
when you

494
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
make a satellite image,

495
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
but if you

496
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
tell others today

497
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
how to

498
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
re-study,

499
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
or

500
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
what you need to

501
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,940
consider when you

502
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
make a result,

503
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
what you need to

504
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
pay attention to,

505
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
then you may

506
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,940
have to flip the

507
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
background data.

508
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
In other words,

509
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
in most cases,

510
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
these background data

511
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
are actually

512
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
to be passed

513
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
along with

514
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
your data.

515
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
So,

516
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
when we

517
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
communicate,

518
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
when we

519
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
do academic communication,

520
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
how do we do

521
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
this?

522
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
To be honest,

523
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
I don't know

524
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
if it's true,

525
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
but some people

526
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
say that

527
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
scientists on

528
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
Earth spend

529
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
about 80% of

530
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
their time

531
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
looking for

532
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
data.

533
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
Here,

534
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
I want to

535
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
give you

536
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
an example.

537
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
This is

538
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
a screen

539
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
screenshot.

540
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
I want to

541
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
use this

542
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
screenshot

543
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
to share

544
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
with you

545
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
that

546
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
finding data

547
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
is really

548
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
difficult.

549
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
It sounds

550
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
simple,

551
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
but it's

552
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
not.

553
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Here,

554
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
I want to

555
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
find

556
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
data on

557
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
the

558
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
surface

559
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
reflectance

560
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
rate.

561
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
I want to

562
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
find out

563
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
the surface

564
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
reflectance

565
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
rate

566
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
of Taiwan

567
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
at a

568
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,940
certain

569
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
time.

570
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
I know

571
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,940
there is

572
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
a device

573
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,940
called

574
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
MODIS

575
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
that can

576
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
observe

577
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
this

578
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
data.

579
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
MODIS

580
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
is a

581
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
website

582
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
called

583
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
NASA Earth

584
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
Data.

585
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
It is

586
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
completely

587
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
open.

588
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Anyone

589
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
can download

590
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
this

591
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
data

592
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
if they

593
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
know

594
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
how to

595
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
search

596
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
and store

597
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,940
data.

598
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
The problem

599
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
is that

600
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
this

601
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
interface

602
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
is really

603
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
complicated.

604
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
First,

605
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
you need to

606
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,940
go to

607
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,940
Earth

608
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Data

609
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
and

610
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
search

611
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
for

612
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
this

613
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
data.

614
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
Why is there

615
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
so many

616
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
data?

617
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Because

618
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
MODIS

619
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
is a

620
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
satellite

621
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
camera,

622
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
but

623
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
when

624
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
processing

625
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
data,

626
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
there are

627
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
many

628
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
levels.

629
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Each

630
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
level

631
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
has

632
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
different

633
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
scientific

634
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
values,

635
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
so

636
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
they

637
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
classify

638
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
them

639
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
in

640
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
different

641
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
ways.

642
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
So

643
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
first of

644
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,940
all,

645
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
you have

646
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,940
to know

647
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
the

648
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
name of

649
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
this

650
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
data

651
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
very

652
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
clearly.

653
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Then,

654
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
of course,

655
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
731

656
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
data

657
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
levels.

658
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Then,

659
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
you can

660
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
draw

661
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,940
where you

662
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
want to

663
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
search on

664
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Earth.

665
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
For

666
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
example,

667
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
I put

668
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
this

669
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
data

670
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
in

671
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
my

672
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,940
computer.

673
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Then,

674
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
you have

675
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
to know

676
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
which

677
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
time and

678
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
which

679
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
time point

680
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
I want to

681
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
capture.

682
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
Then,

683
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
press the

684
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
download

685
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
link

686
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
one by one

687
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
and

688
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
download it

689
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
to your

690
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
computer.

691
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Finally,

692
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
put these

693
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
files in the

694
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
same

695
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
folder one

696
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
by one

697
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
and

698
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
download it.

699
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
In

700
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
my

701
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
case,

702
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
it may

703
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
take two

704
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
to three

705
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
days,

706
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
or even

707
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
longer.

708
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
And

709
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
this is still

710
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
a relatively

711
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
relaxed

712
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
situation.

713
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
If

714
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
you want to

715
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
find

716
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
less

717
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
open

718
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,940
data

719
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
today,

720
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
for

721
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
example,

722
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
German

723
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
or French

724
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
space

725
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
races,

726
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
you

727
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
can

728
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
search for

729
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
this

730
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
content.

731
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
So,

732
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
we have

733
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
these

734
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
difficulties,

735
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
which

736
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
leads me

737
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,940
to say that

738
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,940
I personally

739
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
think that

740
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
data

741
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
science,

742
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
including

743
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
how to

744
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
obtain

745
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
data,

746
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
and

747
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
how to

748
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
process and

749
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
analyze

750
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
these

751
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
data,

752
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
data

753
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
science

754
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,940
itself

755
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
is a

756
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
very

757
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
complex

758
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
field.

759
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
So,

760
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
I

761
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
will

762
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
hold

763
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
this

764
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
conference

765
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
once in

766
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
the United

767
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
States.

768
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,940
There

769
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,940
will be

770
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,940
thousands or

771
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
tens of

772
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
thousands of

773
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
researchers

774
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
attending

775
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
this

776
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
conference

777
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
and

778
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
presenting

779
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
their

780
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
research.

781
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
At

782
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
this

783
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
conference,

784
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
there

785
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
will be

786
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
scientific

787
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,940
collaboration

788
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
or

789
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
if NASA

790
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
has a

791
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
new

792
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
data machine

793
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
and

794
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
NASA

795
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
people

796
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
come and

797
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
tell you

798
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
how to

799
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
use it.

800
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
But

801
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
last year,

802
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
there were

803
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
two

804
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
workshops

805
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
related to

806
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
data

807
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,940
science.

808
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
One

809
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
was

810
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
how to

811
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
use

812
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Python

813
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
to

814
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
analyze

815
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
data.

816
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
I

817
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
personally

818
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
think that

819
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
this

820
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,940
phenomenon

821
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
happened

822
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
recently.

823
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
It

824
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
happened

825
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
less than

826
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
one or

827
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
two years

828
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
ago,

829
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
maybe

830
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
2020 or

831
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
2021.

832
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
But

833
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I think

834
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
this is

835
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
the current

836
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
trend.

837
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
In the

838
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
future,

839
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
this trend

840
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
will only

841
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
increase

842
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
as

843
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
time

844
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
goes

845
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
by.

846
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
So

847
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
I

848
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
think

849
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
this

850
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
trend

851
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,940
will

852
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,940
only

853
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
increase

854
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
as

855
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
time

856
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
goes

857
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
by.

858
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
So

859
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
I

860
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
think

861
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
this

862
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
trend

863
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
will

864
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
only

865
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
increase

866
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
as

867
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
time

868
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
goes

869
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
by.

870
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Thank

871
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
you.

872
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Thank

873
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,940
you.

874
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
So

875
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
speaking of

876
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
this,

877
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
I would like to

878
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
ask everyone

879
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
what do you think

880
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
is the most difficult

881
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
thing to do

882
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
in a research

883
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
plan?

884
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Is it

885
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
looking for

886
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
data?

887
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Or

888
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
analyzing

889
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
data?

890
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Or

891
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
promoting or

892
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
sharing

893
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
research

894
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
results?

895
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Or

896
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
you are

897
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
not

898
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
doing

899
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
research at

900
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
all?

901
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
I

902
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
see

903
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
about

904
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
half of

905
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
you

906
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
think

907
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
writing

908
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
articles,

909
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,940
promoting

910
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
or sharing

911
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
research results

912
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
is the

913
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
most difficult.

914
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Half.

915
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
There

916
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
are

917
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
really

918
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
a lot.

919
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
It's

920
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
already

921
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
more than

922
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
half.

923
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
And

924
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
looking for

925
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
data is

926
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
about

927
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,940
three times.

928
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
And

929
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,940
the rest

930
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
is

931
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
analyzing

932
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
data.

933
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
It looks like

934
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
everyone has

935
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
different ideas.

936
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Then

937
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
these three

938
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
aspects of

939
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
research are

940
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
difficult for

941
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
some people.

942
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
I have more than

943
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
half

944
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
who think

945
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
promoting and

946
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
sharing research

947
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
results are the

948
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
most difficult.

949
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
That's

950
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
right.

951
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
Personally,

952
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
if I had to

953
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
choose,

954
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
I would

955
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
probably

956
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
choose C

957
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
or A.

958
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
I'm not

959
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
sure.

960
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
The

961
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
above

962
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
questions

963
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,940
are what

964
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
Jupyter Meteor

965
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
wants to

966
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
solve.

967
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,940
Let me

968
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
look at

969
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
Jupyter

970
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,940
again.

971
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
Jupyter

972
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
itself is

973
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
an ecosystem.

974
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
In

975
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
simple terms,

976
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
in addition to

977
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Jupyter's

978
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
own tools,

979
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
there are

980
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
many other

981
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
tools.

982
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
They may

983
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
not be

984
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
developed by

985
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
the Jupyter

986
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
team,

987
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
but

988
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Jupyter

989
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
team

990
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,940
often uses

991
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,940
them because

992
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
they can

993
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
assist

994
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
them in

995
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
your

996
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,940
research process.

997
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
There are

998
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
different

999
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
areas.

1000
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
How to

1001
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
say?

1002
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
For example,

1003
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
you may

1004
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
use Python

1005
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
to write

1006
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
your program.

1007
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,940
When you

1008
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
use it,

1009
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
you may

1010
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
use some

1011
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
core components

1012
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
of Python.

1013
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
For example,

1014
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
you may

1015
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
use

1016
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
SciPy or

1017
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
you may

1018
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
use some

1019
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
more professional

1020
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
components.

1021
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
For example,

1022
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
if you want to

1023
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,940
do parallel

1024
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
computing,

1025
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
you may

1026
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
have heard of

1027
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Dask or

1028
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
have used

1029
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Dask.

1030
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
If you

1031
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
want to

1032
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
do image

1033
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
processing,

1034
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I think

1035
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
you may

1036
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
have used

1037
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Scikit-

1038
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
image.

1039
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
In addition

1040
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
to these

1041
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,940
professional

1042
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
components,

1043
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
there are

1044
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
some

1045
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,940
components

1046
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
that

1047
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,940
are used

1048
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
for those

1049
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
who are

1050
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
dealing with

1051
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
astronomical

1052
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
observations.

1053
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Syntax

1054
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
is used

1055
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
for those

1056
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
who are

1057
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
doing

1058
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
earth

1059
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
physics.

1060
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
It is

1061
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
used for

1062
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
those

1063
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
who

1064
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
are

1065
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
calculating

1066
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
geosystem

1067
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
or

1068
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,940
something

1069
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
like that.

1070
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
These

1071
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
different

1072
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
components

1073
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
have different

1074
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
areas

1075
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
and

1076
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
we

1077
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
say

1078
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,940
it is

1079
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
an ecosystem.

1080
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,940
In terms

1081
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
of geosystem

1082
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
research,

1083
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
we will

1084
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,940
find that

1085
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
geosystem

1086
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
research

1087
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
also has

1088
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
different

1089
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
areas,

1090
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
just like

1091
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
other

1092
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
research.

1093
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
For

1094
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
example,

1095
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I call it

1096
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
life cycle

1097
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
here,

1098
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
because

1099
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
I found

1100
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
that this

1101
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
is actually

1102
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
related to

1103
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
time.

1104
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
So

1105
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
if you

1106
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,940
are

1107
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
doing

1108
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
geosystem

1109
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,940
research,

1110
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
you

1111
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
need to

1112
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
collect

1113
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
a lot of

1114
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
data.

1115
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Whether

1116
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
you are

1117
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
going out

1118
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
to collect

1119
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
data or

1120
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
you are

1121
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
directly

1122
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
collecting

1123
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
data on

1124
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
the Internet

1125
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
to see

1126
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,940
if there

1127
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
is

1128
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
any

1129
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,940
data

1130
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,940
that

1131
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,940
is better

1132
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
than

1133
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
what

1134
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,940
you

1135
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
are

1136
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
collecting.

1137
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
So

1138
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
you

1139
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
need to

1140
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
collect

1141
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
a lot

1142

1144
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,940

1154
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
and

to solve.

1190
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
And

1191
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
If you

1196
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
you might

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
want to

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
Jupyter NB Viewer

1201
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
so that

1202
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
other people

1203
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
can see

1204
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,940
your

1205
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
notebook.

1206
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,940
And

1207
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
lastly,

1208
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
if you

1209
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,940
need to

1210
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
teach,

1211
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
you might

1212
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
want to

1213
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
use

1214
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
JupyterHub

1215
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
so that

1216
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
students

1217
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
don't

1218
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,940
have to

1219
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
provide

1220
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
their

1221
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
notebook

1222
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
and

1223
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,940
it can

1224
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
be used

1225
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
for

1226
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
teaching.

1227
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
So

1228
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
we see

1229
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
geological

1230
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
research

1231
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
is

1232
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
actually

1233
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
a very

1234
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
interesting

1235
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,940
field.

1236
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
So

1237
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
we

1238
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
thought

1239
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
that

1240
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
we

1241
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
can

1242
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
promote

1243
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
our

1244
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Jupyter

1245
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
Ecology

1246
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
so that

1247
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
it can

1248
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
be used

1249
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
by

1250
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
future

1251
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
generations

1252
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
for

1253
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
geological

1254
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
research.

1255
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
On the

1256
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
other hand,

1257
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
we can

1258
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
get feedback

1259
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
from

1260
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
geological

1261
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
researchers.

1262
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
For

1263
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
example,

1264
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
if they

1265
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
think

1266
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
this

1267
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
tool

1268
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
is good

1269
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
or

1270
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
hard to

1271
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
use,

1272
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
they

1273
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
can

1274
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,940
let

1275
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,940
the

1276
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
development

1277
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
team

1278
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
know

1279
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,940
that

1280
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
this

1281
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
tool

1282
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
can

1283
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
be used

1284
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
by

1285
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
future

1286
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
generations.

1287
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
So

1288
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
we

1289
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
started

1290
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
this

1291
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Jupyter

1293
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
project.

1294
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
I

1295
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,940
joined

1296
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
this

1297
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,940
project

1298
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
last

1299
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
year.

1300
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
You

1301
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
can

1302
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
see

1303
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
the

1304
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
people

1305
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
in this

1306
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,940
project

1307
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
are

1308
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940

1309
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
and

1310
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
physicists.

1311
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
They

1312
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,940
have

1313
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
different

1314
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
perspectives.

1315
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,940
Some

1316
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
are

1317
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940

and

1319
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,940
physicists.

1320
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
Specifically,

1321
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
we

1322
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
want to

1323
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940

1327
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940

1330
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
We

1331
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
want to

1332
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
use

1333
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
these

1334
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940

1335
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
to

1336
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940

as

1340
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,940
efficient as

1341
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
possible.

1342
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
We

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
the

1408
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
ESSOAR

1409
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
archive,

1410
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
so

1411
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
you can

1412
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
check it

1413
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,940
out

1414
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
at

1415
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
any time

1416
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
through

1417
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
this

1418
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
link.

1419
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
But

1420
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
you can

1421
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
see

1422
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
the

1425
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
on

1426
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
the

1427
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,940
next

1428
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
page.

1429
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
This

1430
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,940
is the

1431
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
page I

1432
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
want to

1433
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
show you

1434
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
today.

1435
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,940
This

1436
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
is

1437
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
the

1438
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,940
page.

1439
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,940
You

1440
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
can see

1441
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,940
that

1442
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,940
this is

1443
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
actually

1444
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
a

1445
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
page

1446
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
built

1447
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,940

1448
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
GitHub.

1449
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
It

1450
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
looks like

1451
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
a document

1452
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
that

1453
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
I

1454
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
wrote.

1455
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
It

1456
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
is actually

1457
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,940
a

1458
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,940
compilation of

1459
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
many

different

notebooks,

1462
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
which means

1463
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
that

1464
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
every page

1465
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
you click

1466
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
here is

1467
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
actually

1468
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
originally

1469
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,940
a

1470
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,940
notebook.

1471
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
You

1472
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,940
can see

1473
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
that

1474
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
it has

1475
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
a lot of

1476
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940

1477
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
telling

1478
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
you how

1479
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
to get

1480
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
the

1481
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
content

1482
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
you

1483
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
want.

1484
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Jupyter

1485
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Book has

1486
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
a button

1487
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
called

1488
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
finder

1489
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940

upper right

1491
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
corner.

1492
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,940
You

1493
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
can

1494
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
turn

1495
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
this

1496
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,940
GitHub

1497
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
page

1498
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
into

1499
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
a

1500
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
page

1501
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
where

1502
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
you

1503
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
can

1504
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,940
run

1505
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,940
code

1506
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,940
directly.

1507
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
But

1508
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
it

1509
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
takes

1510
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
a

long

1512
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
time.

1513
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
Let's

1514
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
take a

1515
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
look.

1516
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
You

1517
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,940
can

1518
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,940
imagine

1519
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
that

1520
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,940
when

1521
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,940
I

1522
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,940
was

1523
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
reporting

1524
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940

I

1530
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
could

1531
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
tell

1532
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,940
most

1533
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
of the

1534
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940

1535
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940

Book.

1538
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
But

1539
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,940
when I

1540
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,940
was

1541
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,940

conference,

1547
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
I

1548
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,940
could

1549
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,940
use

1550
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940

1552
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
or

1553
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,940
my

1554
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,940
laptop

1555
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,940
to

1556
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
show

1557
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,940
them

1558
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
the

1559
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940

1560
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,940
of the

1561
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940

1562
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,940
and

1563
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,940
show

1564
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
them

1565
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
the

1566
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
details

1567
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
of the

1568
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,940
code.

1569
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,940
So

1570
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
you

1571
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,940
can

1572
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
run

1573
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
the

1574
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
final

1575
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
code

1576
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,940
again.

1577
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
You

1578
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
can

1579
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,940
change

1580
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
the

1581
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,940
content

1582
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
like

1583
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
blah blah

1584
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
blah.

1585
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
You

1586
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
can

1587
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
change

1588
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
the

1589
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
content

1590
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
directly.

1591
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
That's

1592
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
about it.

1593
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Let's

1594
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,940
go back

1595
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
to the

1596
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,940
video.

1597
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
Now

1598
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,940
we can

1599
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
have a deeper

1600
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,940
and more

1601
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
efficient

1602
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
academic

1603
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
exchange.

1604
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Here's another

1605
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
example, but

1606
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,940
I'm not going

1607
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,940
to show

1608
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
too many

1609
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
examples.

1610
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
This

1611
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,940
example is

1612
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
an article

1613
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
I

1614
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
submitted

1615
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,940
last year.

1616
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
It's still

1617
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
in the

1618
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,940
draft.

1619
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,940
The

1620
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
screen

1621
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,940
you see

1622
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
now is

1623
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
actually

1624
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
GitHub's

1625
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
page.

1626
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
The

1627
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,940
supplementary

1628
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
material.

1629
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,940
All of

1630
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
this article's

1631
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
supplementary

1632
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
material is

1633
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
actually on

1634
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
GitHub.

1635
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,940
And

1636
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
it's

1637
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
compiled

1638
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
in the

1639
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Driftbook

1640
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
format.

1641
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,940
So

1642
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,940
you can

1643
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
see

1644
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
like

1645
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
this

1646
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
page

1647
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
is

1648
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
saying

1649
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
if

1650
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
you want

1651
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,940
to

1652
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
reproduce

1653
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
this

1654
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
article's

1655
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
material,

1656
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
you can

1657
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
just

1658
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
execute

1659
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
it and

1660
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
it will

1661
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
take the

1662
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
material you

1663
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
want to

1664
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
draw

1665
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,940
from the

1666
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
supplementary

1667
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
material

1668
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
from

1669
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
other

1670
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,940
articles.

1671
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,940
In other

1672
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,940
words,

1673
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,940
when we

1674
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
use these

1675
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
tools

1676
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
to publish

1677
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
articles in

1678
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
the future,

1679
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
the

1680
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
process,

1681
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
the

1682
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
format,

1683
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
and

1684
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
the

1685
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,940
material

1686
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,940
will

1687
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
be

1688
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,940
connected

1689
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
to your

1690
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
article,

1691
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
so they

1692
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
will

1693
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
have a

1694
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
DOI.

1695
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
In other

1696
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
words,

1697
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
the

1698
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
materials you

1699
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
publish

1700
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
will not

1701
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
disappear

1702
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,940
in the

1703
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
vast

1704
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,940
ocean

1705
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,940
of the

1706
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
Internet

1707
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
as

1708
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
time

1709
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
goes by.

1710
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,940
Okay,

1711
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,940
so

1712
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
my main

1713
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
question

1714
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
is,

1715
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
what does

1716
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,940
a DOI

1717
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,940
mean?

1718
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
I actually

1719
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
don't know

1720
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
what DOI

1721
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
is.

1722
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Okay,

1723
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
thank you for

1724
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
asking.

1725
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,940
DOI

1726
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,940
stands for

1727
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,940
digital

1728
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
identification.

1729
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
You

1730
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
can

1731
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
imagine it

1732
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
as

1733
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,940
something like

1734
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,940
the concept

1735
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
of

1736
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,940
a

1737
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
lock number.

1738
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
However,

1739
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
in the

1740
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,940
Internet

1741
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,940
world,

1742
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
for example,

1743
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
you may have to change

1744
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
your website

1745
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,940
due to

1746
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
funding or

1747
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,940
other factors.

1748
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,940
Even publishers

1749
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,940
may change

1750
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,940
their website

1751
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,940
from time to

1752
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,940
time,

1753
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,940
so if

1754
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
you save

1755
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
an article

1756
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,940
in the

1757
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,940
website,

1758
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
you

1759
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
may be

1760
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,940
able to

1761
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
do it

1762
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,940
this year

1763
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,940
or next

1764
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,940
year,

1765
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,940
but

1766
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
it

1767
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
may

1768
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,940
fail

1769
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
ten years

1770
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
later.

1771
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,940
The

1772
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
identification code

1773
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
will not

1774
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,940
change

1775
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
according to

1776
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,940
the

1777
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,940
publisher's

1778
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,940
website.

1779
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,940
In other

1780
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,940
words,

1781
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,940
if you

1782
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
register a

1783
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,940

1784
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,940

1785
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,940
today,

1786
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,940
the identification

1787
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,940

1788
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,940
that is,

will not

1794
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,940
change

1795
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,940
according to

1796
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,940
the publisher's

1797
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,940
website.

1798
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,940
You

1799
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
can connect

1800
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,940

1802
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,940

1803
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,940

and

1807
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,940
it will

1808
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,940
be

1809
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
the

1810
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,940
actual

The

next

1818
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,940
question is

1819

1855
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,940
They

1856
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940

1868
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Then

1869
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,940

they

1878
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,940

1888
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
There are

1889
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,940
two places.

1890
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
One is

1891
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Zenodo

1892
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,940
that I

1893
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,940
just

1894
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,940
said

1895
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,940
is provided by

1896
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,940
CERN.

1897
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,940
The

1898
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,940
other one

1899
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,940
is also

1900
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,940
done by

1901
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,940
the

1902
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,940
Europeans

1903
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,940
called

1904
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,940
Pangea,

1905
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,940
but

1906
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,940
its

1907
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,940
content

1908
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,940
is the

1909
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,940
same as

1910
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,940
this,

1911
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,940
but

1912
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,940
there are

1913
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,940
different

1914
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,940
services

1915
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,940
provided

1916
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,940
by

1917
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,940
Pangea.

1918
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,940
Let me

1919
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,940
briefly

1920
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
explain

1921
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
that.

1922
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,940
What we

1923
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,940
talked about

1924
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,940
before was

1925
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,940
the main

1926
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,940
purpose of

1927
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,940

1929
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
and

1930
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,940
what we

1931
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,940
have done

1932
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,940
so far.

1933
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,940
Next,

1934
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,940
I want to

1935
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,940
talk a little

1936
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,940
about

1937
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,940
what we

1938
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,940
are going

1939
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
to do in

1940
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,940
the future

1941
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,940
and

1942
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
what happened

1943
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
in the

1944
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,940

1967
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
We

1968
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,940

2033
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,940
to

00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,940
This

You

and

2081
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,940
you

2082
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,940

2089
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,940
This

2090
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,940
feature

2091
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,940
is

2092
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,940
already

2093
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,940
very

2094
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,940
big.

2095
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,940
We

2096
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,940
find that

2097
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,940
sometimes it

2098
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,940
is even

2099
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,940
more than

2100
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,940
one

2101
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,940
scientific

2102
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,940
research

2103
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,940
talk,

2104
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,940
not

2105
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,940
two

2106
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,940
scientific

2107
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,940
research

2108
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
talk

2109
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,940
that

2110
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,940
can

2111
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,940
cover.

2112
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,940
So

2113
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,940
a few

2114
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
years

2115
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
ago,

2116
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
there

2117
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
was

2118
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
a

2119
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,940
project

2120
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,940
called

2121
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,940
Jupyter

2122
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Hub.

2123
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,940
Their

2124
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
purpose

2125
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,940
is to

2126
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,940
design

2127
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,940
the

2128
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
next

2129
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,940
generation

2130
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,940
of

2131
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940

2133
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,940
and

2134
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,940
Jupyter

2135
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,940
Book.

2136
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,940
They

2137
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
also

2138
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
conducted

2139
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,940
many

2140
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,940
teaching

2141
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,940
and

2142
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,940
promotion

2143
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,940
activities

2144
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
and

2145
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,940
hope

2146
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,940
to

2147
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,940
bring

2148
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,940
the

2149
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
next

2150
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,940
generation

2151
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,940
of

2152
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,940
Jupyter

2153
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,940
Hub

2154
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,940
to

2155
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,940
the

2156
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,940
world.

2157
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,940
One

2158
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,940
thing that

2159
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,940
makes us

2160
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,940
very happy

2161
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,940
is that

2162
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,940
in the

2163
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
first two

2164
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,940
years,

2165
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,940
the

2166
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
whole

2167
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
geological

2168
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,940
community

2169
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,940
began to

2170
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,940
notice

2171
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,940
this

2172
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,940
Jupyter

2173
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,940
ecosystem

2174
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
and

2175
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,940
started

2176
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
to

2177
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
learn more

2178
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
about

2179
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,940
it.

2180
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,940
So

2181
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
GMVDU is

2182
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,940
a

2183
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,940
geological

2184
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,940
teaching

2185
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,940
website.

2186
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
You can

2187
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,940
see that

2188
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
their

2189
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,940
website is

2190
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,940
also

2191
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,940
written in

2192
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,940
the

2193
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,940
form of

2194
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,940
Jupyter

2195
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
Book.

2196
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
They

2197
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,940
have some

2198
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,940
very cool

2199
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,940
content.

2200
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
For

2201
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
example,

2202
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,940
there is

2203
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
an app

2204
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,940
here.

2205
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,940
I'm not sure

2206
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,940
if it takes

2207
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,940
some time,

2208
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,940
but if you're

2209
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,940
interested,

2210
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,940
you can

2211
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,940
try it.

2212
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,940
Then I

2213
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
won't operate

2214
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
here.

2215
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,940
Oh,

2216
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,940
okay.

2217
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,940
Then you can

2218
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,940
move around

2219
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,940
here and

2220
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,940
see what

2221
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
interesting

2222
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,940
things happen.

2223
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,940
So,

2224
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,940
on the

2225
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,940
other hand,

2226
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,940
in addition to

2227
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,940
these research

2228
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,940
communities,

2229
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
we are also very

2230
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,940
excited to

2231
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,940
say that

2232
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,940
there are more and

2233
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,940
more business

2234
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
communities

2235
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,940
recently.

2236
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
For example,

2237
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,940
Microsoft

2238
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,940
launched a

2239
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,940
plan called

2240
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
Planetary Computer

2241
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
in 2020.

2242
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,940
What

2243
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,940
they

2244
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,940
actually want

2245
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,940
to do is

2246
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,940
provide

2247
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,940
Microsoft's

2248
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,940
budget

2249
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,940
resources

2250
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,940
to the

2251
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,940
geological

2252
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,940
community.

2253
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
Their

2254
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,940
stock price

2255
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,940
has increased

2256
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,940
significantly.

2257
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,940
With these

2258
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,940
business communities,

2259
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,940
I personally

2260
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,940
think that

2261
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,940
the investment

2262
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,940
of these

2263
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,940
business communities

2264
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,940
can make

2265
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,940
this Jupiter

2266
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,940
ecosystem more

2267
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,940
perfect and

2268
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,940
truly become

2269
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,940
the data

2270
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,940
analysis standard

2271
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,940
for geological

2272
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,940
research in

2273
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,940
the next

2274
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
era.

2275
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,940
That's

2276
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,940
my

2277
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,940
share

2278
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,940
for today.

2279
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,940
Thank you

2280
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,940
all.

2281
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,940
If you have any

2282
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,940
questions,

2283
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,940
please

2284
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,940
let me know.

2285
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Thank you,

2286
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,940
Huaijie.

2287
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,940
Do you have

2288
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,940
any questions

2289
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,940
you want to

2290
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,940
ask?

2291
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,940
Can I

2292
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,940
ask a question?

2293
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,940
Sure.

2294
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,940
Who was

2295
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
that?

2296
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Me.

2297
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,940
I'll

2298
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
go first.

2299
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
Hi,

2300
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,940
Huaijie.

2301
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,940
I'm

2302
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
Wangjie.

2303
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Hi.

2304
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,940
I actually

2305
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,940
have a

2306
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
very

2307
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,940
basic

2308
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,940
question

2309
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,940
that I

2310
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,940
want to

2311
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,940
ask.

2312
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,940
What

2313
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,940
is the

2314
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,940
basic

2315
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,940
question?

2316
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,940
How

2317
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,940
does a

2318
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,940
Jupiter

2319
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,940
user

2320
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,940
get into

2321
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,940
a

2322
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,940
developer?

2323
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,940
I'm

2324
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,940
curious about

2325
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
this.

2326
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,940
I'm a

2327
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,940
heavy

2328
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,940
Jupiter

2329
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,940
user,

2330
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,940
but I

2331
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,940
always feel

2332
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,940
that there

2333
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,940
is a

2334
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,940
big

2335
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,940
red

2336
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
line for

2337
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
developers.

2338
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,940
I'm

2339
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
curious

2340
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
about

2341
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
how

2342
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,940
you

2343
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
get

2344
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
into

2345
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
this

2346
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,940
red

2347
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
line.

2348
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Thank

2349
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,940
you.

2350
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,940
For me,

2351
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,940
I think

2352
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,940
Jupiter is

2353
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,940
pretty

2354
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,940
grassroots.

2355
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,940
They

2356
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
have a

2357
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,940
very active

2358
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,940
community

2359
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,940
interaction.

2360
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
Some

2361
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,940
software

2362
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,940
don't

2363
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,940
have that

2364
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,940
strong

2365
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,940
connection

2366
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,940
between

2367
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,940
developers and

2368
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
users.

2369
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,940
But

2370
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,940
Jupiter

2371
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,940
has a

2372
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,940
very active

2373
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
community

2374
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,940
interaction.

2375
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,940
I think

2376
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,940
if you're

2377
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
interested in

2378
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,940
developing

2379
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,940
Jupiter,

2380
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,940
I think

2381
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,940
you can

2382
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,940
start by

2383
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,940

2384
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,940

2385
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,940
group.

2386
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,940
Jupiter

2387
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,940
itself

2388
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,940
has a

2390
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,940
In addition

2392

00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,940
you can post

They

2399
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
also have

2400
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,940

2403
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,940
They

2404
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,940
have a

group.

2407
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,940
Okay.

2408
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,940
Here

2409
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940

2411
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,940
In

2412
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,940
addition to

2413
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,940
the

2414
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,940
discussion,

2415
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,940
let me

2416
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,940
see.

2417
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,940
I

2418
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,940
find

2419
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,940
something.

2420
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,940
Yes,

2421
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,940
that's

2422
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,940
right.

2423
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:40,940
So,

2424
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,940
in addition

2425
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,940

2426
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,940

2427
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,940
they also

2428
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,940
have some

2429
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,940
discussion groups.

2430
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,940
In these

2431
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,940
two places,

2432
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,940

2434
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,940
many

2435
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,940
users

2436
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,940
will

2437
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
post

2438
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,940
questions

2439
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,940
and answer

2440
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,940
questions.

2441
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
You will

2442
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,940
see many

2443
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,940
developers

2444
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
coming and

2445
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
going.

2446
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,940
So,

2447
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,940
I think

2448
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,940
if you

2449
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,940
want to

2450
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
go from

2451
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,940
users to

2452
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,940
developers,

2453
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,940
the first

2454
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
step is

2455
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
to

2456
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,940
establish

2457
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,940
your

2458
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,940
team.

2459
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,940
And

2460
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,940
then you

2461
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,940
can feel

2462
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
which

2463
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,940
questions

2464
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,940
they really

2465
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
want to

2466
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,940
solve now.

2467
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,940
These

2468
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,940
questions

2469
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,940
may be

2470
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,940
very

2471
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,940
detailed,

2472
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,940
but

2473
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,940
these

2474
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:31,940
detailed

2475
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,940
questions

2476
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,940
are

2477
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,940
easier

2478
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
for

2479
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
developers

2480
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,940
to

2481
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,940
handle.

2482
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,940
Through

2483
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,940
these

2484
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,940
detailed

2485
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,940
questions,

2486
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,940
you can

2487
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,940
get

2488
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,940
a better

2489
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,940
understanding

2490
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
of

2491
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,940
the

2492
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,940
problem.

2493
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,940
So,

2494
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,940
I think

2495
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,940
that's

2496
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,940
all.

2497
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,940
Thank you.

2531
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,940
In the last

2532
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940

2533
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
how do you

2534
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
share

2535
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,940
your

2536
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
research

2537
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
from

2538
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,940
your own

2539
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
research

2540
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
from the

2541
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,940
program to

2542
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,940
a readable

2543
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,940
page or

2544
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,940
a Jupyter

2545
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,940
book?

2546
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
For

2547
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,940
example,

2548
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,940
you

2549
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,940
just

2550
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,940
quickly

2551
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,940
looked at

2552
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,940
a lot of

2553
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
GitHub

2554
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,940
or

2555
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,940
your

2556
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,940
Jupyter

2557
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
book.

2558
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,940
I

2559
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,940
want to

2560
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,940
ask,

2561
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,940
for

2562
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,940
example,

2563
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,940
how do

2564
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:18,940
you define

2565
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,940
or how

2566
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,940
does your

2567
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,940
workflow

2568
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
work?

2569
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,940
How

2570
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,940
do you

2571
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,940
combine

2572
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,940
your

2573
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,940
work

2574
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,940
and

2575
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,940
your

2576
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,940
GitHub

2577
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,940
and

2578
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,940
publish?

2579
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,940
What

2580
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,940
tools

2581
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
are

2582
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,940
needed?

2583
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,940
How

2584
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,940
do you

2585
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
combine

2586
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,940
your

2587
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,940
work and

2588
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,940
your

2589
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,940
GitHub?

2590
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,940
I

2591
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,940
think

2592
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,940
we don't

2593
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,940
have the

2594
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,940
most standard

2595
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,940
answer yet.

2596
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,940
We

2597
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,940
want to

2598
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
now,

2599
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,940
we

2600
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,940
think there

2601
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
is a

2602
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,940
way to

2603
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
do it.

2604
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
For

2605
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
a

2606
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
research

2607
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,940
team,

2608
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
they can

2609
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,940
have a

2610
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,940
shared

2611
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,940
work environment.

2612
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,940
This

2613
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,940
work

2614
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,940
environment

2615
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,940
is

2616
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,940
JupyterHub.

2617
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,940
You

2618
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,940
can install

2619
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,940
JupyterHub on

2620
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,940
your

2621
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,940
computer

2622
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,940
or

2623
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:17,940
a

2624
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,940
cloud

2625
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,940
resource.

2626
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,940
In

2627
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,940
this way,

2628
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,940
all your

2629
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,940
research

2630
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
materials,

2631
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
code,

2632
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,940
data,

2633
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,940
etc.

2634
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,940
are

2635
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
basically

2636
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,940
in the

2637
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
cloud.

2638
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,940
You

2639
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,940
don't

2640
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,940
need

2641
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,940
your

2642
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,940

think that

3368
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,940
JupyterHub

3369
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,940
has a

3370
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,940
community

3371
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,940
called

3372
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,940
EarthCube.

3373
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,940
I

3374
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,940
think that

3375
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,940
you can imagine it as

3376
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,940
an organization

3377
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,940
under NSF.

3378
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,940
I just posted a link.

3379
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,940
You can see what they are doing.

3380
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,940
They are

3381
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,940
an organization

3382
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,940
that

3383
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,940
applies for funds from NSF.

3384
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,940
They invite

3385
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,940
other people

3386
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,940
to join their organization.

3387
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,940
They invite other people to join their organization.

3388
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,940
These plans are related to

3389
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,940
data, tools,

3390
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,940
and research.

3391
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,940
These plans are related to

3392
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,940
data, tools, and research.

3393
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,940
They save money for these plans.

3394
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,940
It's like

3395
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,940
indirectly

3396
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,940
applying for

3397
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,940
funds from NSF.

3398
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,940
applying for funds from NSF.

3399
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,940
You mean that

3400
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,940
EarthCube's funds

3401
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,940
are not entirely from NSF?

3402
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,940
I think that

3403
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,940
their funds

3404
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,940
are entirely from NSF.

3405
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,940
I think that

3406
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,940
their funds are entirely from NSF.

3407
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,940
I think that

3408
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,940
their funds are entirely from NSF.

3409
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,940
EarthCube's organization

3410
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,940
is based on

3411
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,940
one of NSF's plans.

3412
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,940
You can see the number of plans.

3413
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,940
You can see the number of plans.

3414
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,940
They are using

3415
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,940
this kind of funds.

3416
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,940
But there is still a problem.

3417
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,940
But there is still a problem.

3418
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,940
There is a problem

3419
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,940
that I think is interesting.

3420
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,940
A few days ago,

3421
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,940
EarthCube had a meeting.

3422
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,940
They discussed that

3423
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,940
if there is a data repository

3424
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,940
how can the traditional

3425
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,940
way of applying for funds

3426
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,940
to maintain the data repository

3427
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,940
to maintain the data repository

3428
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,940
to maintain the data repository

3429
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,940
If we really follow

3430
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,940
the traditional way,

3431
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,940
we will definitely run out of funds

3432
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,940
and the plan will be terminated.

3433
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:04,940
I don't think

3434
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,940
they have a very good answer

3435
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,940
I don't think they have a very good answer

3436
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,940
because no matter what the answer is,

3437
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,940
it takes a lot of effort,

3438
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:14,940
but it is a very difficult challenge

3439
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:14,940


3440
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,940
and you can ask

3441
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,940
if they can change this.

3442
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,940
if they can change this.

3443
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:20,940


3444
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,940
It takes a long time

3445
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,940
before you can do it.

3446
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,940
It takes a long time before you can do it.

3447
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,940
It is not like the short-term

3448
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,940
or two to three-year preservation

3449
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,940
That's about it.

3450
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,940
That's about it.

3451
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:36,940
We are still figuring out more.

3452
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,940
We are still figuring out more.

3453
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,940
Thank you for your research.

3454
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,940
It is true that

3455
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,940
we need someone to do this.

3456
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,940
It is true that we need someone to do this.

3457
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:48,940
It is true that we need someone to do this.

3458
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,940
Someone just posted

3459
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,940
Thank you.

3460
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:54,940
NASA is a

01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,940
I think

3462
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,940
it is a

3463
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,940
very forward-looking organization

3464
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,940
on this issue.

3465
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:04,940
They announced

3466
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:06,940
a plan

3467
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,940
last year or the year before

3468
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,940
that after a certain year

3469
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,940
that after a certain year

3470
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,940
all the data of NASA

3471
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:16,940
must meet the standards of Open Science

3472
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,940
must meet the standards of Open Science

3473
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,940
must meet the standards of Open Science

3474
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,940
including the data before

3475
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,940
and the data now collected

3476
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,940
must be in line with

3477
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,940
the data now collected

3478
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,940
This requires a lot of people

3479
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:32,940
to do it.

3480
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:34,940
to do it.

3481
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,940
to do it.

3482
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,940
Do you have any questions?

3483
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,940
Do you have any questions?

3484
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,940
Can I ask a question?

3485
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,940
Go ahead.

3486
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,940
I have two questions.

3487
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,940
The first one is

3488
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,940
I have left the country

3489
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,940
I don't know if I mentioned it last year.

3490
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,940
I am sorry if I did.

3491
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,940
I am sorry if I did.

3492
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,940
I first learned Python

3493
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,940
and then I started using Jupyter

3494
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,940
and then I started using Jupyter

3495
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,940
and then I started using Jupyter

3496
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:06,940
demo

3497
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,940
demo

3498
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,940
demo

3499
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,940
demo

3500
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,940
In science complex

3501
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,940
In science complex

3502
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,940
In science complex

3503
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,940
With Jupyter

3504
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,940
Take Python script code

3505
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,940
and Use metadata plot

3506
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,940
and Use metadata plot

3507
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,940
and Use metadata plot

3508
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:36,940
In this comparison

3509
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,940
In this comparison

3510
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,940
What do you think is the advantage?

3511
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,940
Or the interaction?

3512
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,940
Because interaction has other tools

3513
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,940
we can use

3514
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,940
I haven't found out

3515
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,940
I haven't found out

3516
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,940
why we should use Jupyter

3517
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,940
and not Python script

3518
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,940
and not Python script

3519
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,940
And use command line

3520
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,940
to draw, and plot

3521
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,940
And the second question

3522
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,940
is about data structure

3523
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,940
Because you mentioned

3524
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,940
there is another

3525
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,940
data structure in D-technology

3526
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:12,940
called X-array

3527
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,940
And

3528
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,940
I know the data format

3529
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,940
of HDF5

3530
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,940
Because what I'm doing now

3531
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,940
is more about earthquake science

3532
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:24,940
And when we collect data

3533
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,940
there will be

3534
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,940
large size

3535
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,940
and time

3536
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,940
So the data structure

3537
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,940
is a big problem

3538
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,940
HDF5 is very efficient

3539
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,940
So I want to ask

3540
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,940
When you use X-array

3541
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,940
What are the advantages

3542
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,940
compared to HDF5?

3543
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,940
Or why

3544
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,940
HDF5 used a long time

3545
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,940
in geophysics

3546
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,940
It looks like the format you are used to

3547
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,940
Why not use X-array?

3548
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,940
And

3549
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,940
To answer

3550
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,940
the question

3551
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,940
If you want to promote a tool

3552
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,940
How to promote a tool?

3553
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,940
Convince people it's fast

3554
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:08,940
And they will use it

3555
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,940
I was convinced

3556
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,940
Our research team

3557
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,940
My boss

3558
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,940
asked me to find

3559
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,940
a suitable database

3560
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,940
The database I used was SQL

3561
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,940
So I talked about SQL

3562
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,940
But later I found

3563
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,940
Many people only use HDF5

3564
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,940
I was thinking

3565
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,940
How come I never heard of SQL

3566
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,940
SQL is so fast

3567
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,940
Why use HDF5?

3568
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,940
After using it

3569
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,940
I found HDF5 is faster

3570
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,940
and has advantages

3571
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,940
So I was convinced

3572
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,940
If you want to promote

3573
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,940
Let it know how fast it is

3574
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,940
So the above two questions

3575
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:50,940
Please answer

3576
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,940
Ok

3577
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,940
The first question

3578
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,940
Is to ask

3579
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,940
What are the advantages of Jupyter compared to PythonScript?

3580
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,940
The second question

3581
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,940
is

3582
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,940
What is the second question?

3583
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,940
The second question is the data structure

3584
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,940
Why there is an X-array

3585
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,940
X-array VS HDF5

3586
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,940
Ok

3587
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,940
The first question

3588
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,940
I have two different answers

3589
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,940
The first answer is simple

3590
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,940
Jupyter Notebook

3591
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,940
Compared to PythonScript

3592
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,940
It can contain more files

3593
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,940
When you write PythonScript

3594
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,940
You can only put

3595
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,940
You can only put

3596
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,940
files in the folder

3597
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,940
But

3598
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,940
And the format of the file

3599
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,940
can only be in text

3600
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,940
It can't be in some

3601
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,940
For example, LaTeX or pictures

3602
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,940
But in Jupyter

3603
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,940
You can put

3604
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,940
But in Jupyter

3605
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,940
You can put

3606
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,940
You can put

3607
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,940
You can use different

3608
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,940
Markdown format to write

3609
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,940
Then you can

3610
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,940
You can use LaTeX to mark your

3611
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,940
Mathematics

3612
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,940
You can even insert a picture

3613
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:08,940
Insert a video

3614
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,940
Insert different links

3615
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,940
These extra things

3616
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,940
Can be used in a better way

3617
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,940
To explain why you want to

3618
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,940
Or when your format

3619
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,940
After a picture

3620
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,940
You can directly explain below

3621
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,940
What happened in the picture

3622
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,940
The advantage is

3623
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,940
In the format block

3624
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,940
Jupyter Notebook will display the result directly

3625
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,940
This is also a general PythonScript

3626
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,940
Can't do

3627
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,940
So simply put

3628
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,940
Jupyter Notebook

3629
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,940
Can make you do

3630
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:44,940
In

3631
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,940
When writing your format

3632
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,940
You can put all your

3633
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,940
Explanation

3634
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,940
To be included

3635
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,940
This is a simple answer

3636
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:56,940
The complicated answer is that we want to

3637
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,940
Through Jupyter Notebook to change

3638
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,940
After we write

3639
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,940
The standard of academic articles

3640
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,940
Especially in

3641
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,940
Ah

3642
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,940
Or in that

3643
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:10,940
Supplemental information

3644
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,940
Then I just had something

3645
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,940
Ah

3646
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,940
I recently uploaded an article

3647
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,940
Here I am still writing

3648
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,940
Not yet published

3649
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,940
But his

3650
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,940
Supplemental information

3651
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,940
In fact

3652
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,940
In fact, there are many notebooks

3653
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,940
In the past

3654
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,940
In an era without notebooks

3655
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,940
If you really want to upload the format to others

3656
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,940
Then there will be a format and an article

3657
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:38,940
Then maybe add a lot of

3658
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,940
The picture of the format

3659
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,940
Then we can put it all together in a document

3660
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,940
Then arrange them so that

3661
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,940
The reader can be more accurate

3662
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:48,940
What happened in these things

3663
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,940
Then others can

3664
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,940
Easier to follow

3665
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,940
Ah to execute

3666
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:56,940
To review your results

3667
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,940
This is the first question

3668
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,940
The second question is

3669
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,940
Ah

3670
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,940
In my opinion, HDF5 and

3671
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,940
Xray actually

3672
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,940
It's not a conflict between the two

3673
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,940
HDF5

3674
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,940
Ah

3675
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,940
Its advantage is

3676
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,940
Ah

3677
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,940
Ah

3678
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,940
With reading

3679
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,940
It is

3680
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,940
The data stored in the structure

3681
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,940
So reading is fast

3682
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,940
Then you have to

3683
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,940
Draw a few layers of data at any time

3684
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,940
Then Xray

3685
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,940
It's actually on the data

3686
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,940
Optimized especially in

3687
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,940
If you use Xray

3688
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,940
To read a array

3689
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,940
Then

3690
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,940
This array can be easily cut into several

3691
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,940
Different small arrays

3692
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,940
Then each array is sent directly to the different

3693
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,940
Ah

3694
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,940
Different parallel processing workers

3695
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,940
Then start parallel processing directly

3696
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,940
So I would say the two of them

3697
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,940
There are different interests in data analysis

3698
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:00,940
It's not

3699
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,940
It's not a set of conflicts

3700
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,940
OK

3701
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,940
I just had a notification on my phone

3702
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,940
So I just interrupted you

3703
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,940
I just heard you say

3704
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,940
So you think Xray is mainly because it can

3705
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,940
Parallel processing in this regard

3706
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,940
Is it like this?

3707
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,940
Ah, I didn't say it was an advantage

3708
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:20,940
I said they were dealing with different things

3709
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,940
Oh, OK

3710
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,940
Because HDF5 can actually

3711
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,940
Use parallel processing to read

3712
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,940
The data inside

3713
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:30,940
Does that make sense?

3714
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,940
The difference is even smaller

3715
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,940
No, Xray

3716
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,940
The data structure processed by Xray

3717
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,940
Only Array

3718
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,940
Oh, OK, I understand

3719
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,940
So

3720
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,940
But it's for Array

3721
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,940
This data structure has done a lot of optimization

3722
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,940
OK

3723
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,940
So yeah, so I still think

3724
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,940
They are actually two different things

3725
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,940
You won't hear that someone is in Xray

3726
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,940
Put a bunch of metadata

3727
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,940
Oh, I understand

3728
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,940
Thank you

3729
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,940
Thank you

3730
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,940
Can I ask another question?

3731
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,940
OK

3732
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,940
Please

3733
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,940
In the chat

3734
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,940
I put a link

3735
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,940
In the chat

3736
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,940
It's a github data website

3737
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,940
Very suitable for

3738
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,940
The audience to directly read

3739
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,940
Your stuff

3740
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,940
Is that version directly from github

3741
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,940
You can turn it into that format

3742
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,940
Or is it another design?

3743
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,940
Yes

3744
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,940
It is

3745
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,940
An automated process

3746
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:38,940
Directly from that github

3747
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,940
Turned into a version suitable for reading

3748
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Can I share my screen?

3749
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,940
To explain this question

3750
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,940
You may need a screen

3751
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,940
OK

3752
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,940
This is my

3753
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,940
Check where my github is

3754
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,940
Suppose this

3755
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,940
Suppose this

3756
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,940
Suppose there is a

3757
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:02,940
Github storage

3758
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,940
So if I want to automatically

3759
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,940
Turn this storage into

3760
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,940
Github page

3761
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,940
Then I am through

3762
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,940
A github action

3763
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:14,940
The script does

3764
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,940
So you go here

3765
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,940
You can see what I did

3766
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,940
Then there will be some

3767
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,940
Things you will see

3768
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:24,940
Every time you submit

3769
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,940
Then there will be a github action

3770
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,940
Execute here

3771
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,940
This action is actually

3772
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,940
Automatic

3773
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,940
Put in

3774
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:36,940
What's in the github folder

3775
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,940
To compile

3776
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,940
The github page you see

3777
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:42,940
If you are interested

3778
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,940
You can ask me how to do it

3779
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,940
But if you want to know

3780
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,940
What is in this action

3781
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,940
There is a

3782
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,940
The folder is called

3783
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,940
You can see here

3784
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,940
There is a build

3785
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,940
This is probably

3786
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:00,940
You want to let this github action

3787
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,940
Execute the necessary settings

3788
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,940
That's about it

3789
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,940
Simply put, that's it

3790
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,940
So you need to have this workflow

3791
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,940
You need to have a folder

3792
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,940
Tell this workflow how to compile

3793
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:14,940
Your file

3794
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:16,940
That's it

3795
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,940
I think this

3796
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,940
This thing feels like

3797
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,940
A lot of areas will be interested

3798
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,940
It looks like

3799
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,940
Everyone here should be quite interested

3800
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:28,940
I would suggest you

3801
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,940
For example, we invite you

3802
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,940
To open a workshop during the summer vacation

3803
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,940
To teach everyone how to do this

3804
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,940
Sure

3805
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,940
Of course

3806
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,940
Everyone is very interested

3807
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,940
Share

3808
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,940
Current practice

3809
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,940
OK

3810
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,940
Maybe there are a few other things

3811
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,940
You can

3812
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,940
Anyway, I may contact you later

3813
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,940
No problem

3814
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,940
Is there any problem here?

3815
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,940
Jack said thank you for sharing

3816
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:12,940
Thank you everyone

3817
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,940
Thank you everyone for being there until the last moment

3818
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,940
Thank you very much

3819
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,940
It's really interesting

3820
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,940
OK

3821
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,940
That's the end of our speech today

3822
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,940
That's the end of our speech today

3823
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,940
Thank you very much

3824
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,940
Then we will meet again later

3825
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,940
No problem

3826
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,940
If you are interested

3827
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,940
If you have more questions, please contact me

3828
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,940
I will post my email here

3829
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,940
Quickly

3830
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,940
Thank you

3831
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,940
So you can know

3832
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,940
How to contact me

3833
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,940
