00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to today's TerraTalk. I am today's host, Zhang Yan-Yong.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a speech.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Today's topic is from the base to the surface.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
The impact of aquatic plants on the surface of the environment and sedimentary sediments in the environment.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Chen Qian-Yong.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Dr. Chen Qian-Yong is currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
Her main job is in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability Project.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
Her Ph.D. is in the UIUC Archaeology Department.

01:00.000 --> 01:15.000
Her main focus is on Interfacial Gas Transfer and Sediment Dynamics in Environmental Flows with Aquatic Vegetation.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
She is currently in Oak Ridge.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Of course, she does a lot of modeling and numerical simulation.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Before she came to the UIUC and got her Ph.D.,

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
she got her Bachelor's Degree in Physics from Tsinghua University in Taiwan.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Then she got her Master's Degree in Fluid Mechanics from NTU.

01:43.000 --> 01:58.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Chen Qian-Yong to give us a wonderful speech.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Thank you for the introduction.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
My name is Chen Qian-Yong.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Oak Ridge National Lab.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
I am honored to be able to give a lecture on Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability on Taira's platform.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
As I mentioned earlier, I expect the audience to be from all walks of life.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
So I will try to make my presentation as general as possible.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
I hope that everyone will be able to understand some of the topics in the Hydropower Resilience and Sustainability project.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
I will mainly focus on the research topics during my Ph.D.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
I will introduce how hydropower resilience affects the surface of the environment, and the mechanism of subsurface sedimentation.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
I hope to make some small extensions and introduce some of the most popular research topics in our field.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
As I mentioned earlier, I hope the whole process will be easier and more discussionable.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I will briefly introduce my background.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I graduated from Tsinghua University and majored in physics.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I went to Taiwan University to major in fluid mechanics.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
After that, I moved to Illinois.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I majored in soil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I am a Ph.D. in hydropower engineering.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I just finished my master's degree last month.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
So I just moved to the National Laboratory of Hydropower in Tennessee for the first week.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
I am a Ph.D. in environmental sciences.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
My research during my Ph.D. is mainly focused on hydropower.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Although I am now at Oak Ridge, which is famous for numerical simulation,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
my work during my master's degree is mainly numerical simulation.

04:14.000 --> 04:22.000
However, during my Ph.D., I mainly do experiments and image processing.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Basically, I will place different hydropower structures in my hydropower experiments.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
or I will simulate hydropower in a real environment,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
and see how it affects the flow of water.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Then we will use high-resolution laser imaging to do hydropower testing.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I will explain the more detailed experiment settings and methods later.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
My main field of research is applied in environmental fluid mechanics,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Before I get into my research topic,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I want to spend some time to introduce

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
what the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering is doing.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I also want to explain what the Department of Applied Environmental Fluid Mechanics,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
fluid flow experiments, and theory in ecological hydropower are.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I hope to give you some basic concepts.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
You may have some questions about why I am studying applied fluid mechanics in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Because people generally have an impression of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
that it is about building houses or buildings.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
In fact, it is not like that.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
The Department of Applied Environmental Engineering has a very wide range of things to study.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
For example, if you can see the English name of its department.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It is called Schedule of Engineering,

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
In fact, in Chinese, we should refer to it as Civil or Jameson Engineering.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Then in Taiwan, generally speaking,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
we separate the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering from the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Then, like TAIWEN and JIAUCHEN State University,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
there is a Department of Applied Environmental Engineering

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering lacks Opining Institute,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
a branch of the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Then ChengDinh University,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
even has a department of Applied Environmental Engineering.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
In addition, the Department of AppliedEnvironmental Engineering is allowed to study mainly heavily in China,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
In fact, like in the United States,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
generally speaking, the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering and the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering are integrated into a department.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
So we call it Civil and Environmental Engineering.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
In the field of Applied Environmental Engineering,

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
in fact, it includes structures, geotechnical,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
or transportation, etc.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Then the field of Applied Environmental Engineering is mainly divided into water quality, air pollution, and green energy.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
Among them is the water resource engineering, natural disasters, climate change, etc.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
are all in the field between Applied Environmental Engineering and Applied Environmental Engineering.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
In fact, there are a lot of professors in the Department of Applied Environmental Engineering in the United States

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
are engaged in research on this area.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
OK, good.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Here I want to ask you a question.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I just talked about water resource engineering,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
which is the field of my Ph.D. main focus program.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
generally speaking, you will think of what it is about,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
what this field is doing.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
That is, everyone can express their own impression.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
what do you think of?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Does anyone want to share?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Let me talk about it first.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
OK.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I may be a little awkward.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
What I think of intuitively is to build a water dam,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
or to build a channel, something like that.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yes, yes.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yes.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
OK, does anyone else want to share?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
When it comes to water resource engineering,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
what do you think of?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
OK.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Everyone may be a little shy.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
In fact, I just talked about building a water dam and then a channel.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
That's right.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
This is indeed what water resource engineering is doing.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, roughly speaking,

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I like it very much.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Our university has a course

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
called Water Resource Engineering Discussion.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And in this course,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
when the teacher is talking,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I like to use this picture

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
to roughly explain what water resource engineering is.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Basically, it actually

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
puts all the water,

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
that is, the water cycle in the natural world,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
to do research on each different component.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I personally like to divide it into

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
four different sub-fields,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
such as aquatics,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
groundwater,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
aquatics,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
water resource planning,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
and management.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
As I mentioned earlier,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
building a water dam or a channel

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
is more like aquatics.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Because you may have to calculate some fluid mechanics

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
to know that

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
what you are going to build

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
for your dam and base.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So it's actually a bit cross-referential

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
because you still have to

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
do some structural engineering

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
with the traditional earth and wood.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Because they understand the structure

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and we understand fluid mechanics.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
But water resource engineering is actually mainly

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I like to divide it into these four.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm actually mainly focused on

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
environmental fluid mechanics.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And this thing can actually be said to be

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
one of the components in fluid mechanics.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
But it can also be said to be

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
a university door that comes out independently.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Environmental fluid mechanics

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
is actually mainly about

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
how matter

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
spreads and spreads

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
in the natural world.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
This natural fluid can be water

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
and it can also be air.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
For example, the emission of factory smoke.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And then there's the construction of a water reservoir.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And then the impact on natural water flow.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And then there's the waves of the ocean

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
and the sea cycle.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Or even the typhoon.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Because I just mentioned that

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
your natural fluid can be water

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
or air.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
So typhoon

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
These are actually

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
environmental fluid mechanics

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
research areas.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
And then I've been talking about

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
a fluid phenomenon.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
It's turbulence.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It's called turbulence in English.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
This Chinese can actually be called turbulence

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
It can also be called turbulence.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So if you've ever been on a plane,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
you must have heard of it.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
We often have turbulence on the plane.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
What about this turbulence?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
In fact, in fluid mechanics,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's also a very popular

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It's also a very important topic.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Like the famous physicist

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Richard Feynman

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
once said

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Turbulence is a

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's been around for over a hundred years.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And then it hasn't been completely solved.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
A complex physical problem.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So what exactly is turbulence?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Turbulence can be said to be a kind of fluid

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Fluid state

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
What about when the flow rate is very small?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Fluid is a layer-by-layer fluid.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
They don't mix with each other.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
And then this state

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
We call it a flow.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
But when you

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
When the speed of the object increases,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
The flow of the fluid

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
There will be a wave-like pendulum.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And then the frequency of the pendulum and the government

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
The flow rate will increase faster and faster.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
So when the fluid reaches

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
When it's past the transition stage

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It will enter

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
A state called turbulence

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
When it reaches this speed

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
In fact, you can find that the flow becomes

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It's no longer clear.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
You can't track

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Every flow

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It's from the beginning to the end

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
How does it flow in the middle?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And then there will be a lot of small whirlpools in the flow.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Then these whirlpools

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
We call it turbulence or turbulence.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
The scientist here

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Propose a parameter

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
It's called Reynolds.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And then use this parameter

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
We can assess

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That's how messy this flow is.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
It's basically a

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
The ratio of fluid inertia to fluid viscosity

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So the bigger the Reynolds number

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It means that the fluid is more chaotic.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
A simple example is a bee and water.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Like bees, we can know

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
It's very viscous.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So it's your molecule.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's your Reynolds number.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The Reynolds number is very small.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So basically

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
We say honey

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
This kind of thing

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
It's not so messy.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Not turbulence

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
But like water

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Especially in a natural environment

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Like a waterfall

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Basically because it's very viscous

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
So once your inertia is very fast

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Your Reynolds number is big

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
You'll find that it's basically very messy.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And then it's easy to produce this kind of turbulence.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
In the natural world, in fact,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Most of the fluids belong to turbulence.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So turbulence is studying environmental fluid mechanics.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Is a very important indicator

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Yes, and then like a river.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And then the volcano erupts

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
In fact, it's all a kind of turbulence.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
A phenomenon on the environmental fluid

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Yes, so my research is basically

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
The concept of fluid mechanics and turbulence

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Applied to ecological fluid mechanics

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
What is ecological fluid mechanics?

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
It is to explore the interaction between fluid mechanics and ecology.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So it can be roughly divided into three major areas.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
One is fluid mechanics

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
One is what we call geological geometry and ecology.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Interaction between each other

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Interconnection and influence

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Just give a simple example

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
It's like if I have some beavers.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
That's what we call the water in the river.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
That should be in Chinese.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Because the beaver basically builds the water dam.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
We call it beaver dam

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Once this beaver

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It belongs to an ecological phenomenon

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
And then these animals are in the river.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Built a dam

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
After the dam is built, it will change the fluid.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Change the fluid

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It may change the entire river bed.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So the whole geological geometry will change

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
After the geological geometry changes

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It may come back to affect you.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
This reasonable ecology

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Because you have changed the geological

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Maybe it's more suitable for them to survive.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
So it becomes more

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Or become more unsuitable for survival

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Then they will become less

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So it's actually a mutual

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
How to say

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
An ecological chain that affects each other

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Ecological geometry is currently in the water resource project

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It's a relatively new

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And a more and more popular field

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Mainly because people began to realize

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
The importance of many ecological projects

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Like the redwood forest on the bank of the river

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
The existence of redwood forest

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
It helps to naturally block the waves

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Then reduce the erosion of the river

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
From the perspective of biodiversity

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
At the same time, it can also provide different species

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
An ecological habitat

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
At the same time, the large trees on the bank of the river

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Also play a similar role

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Okay, so much

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I hope to take advantage of the time in front

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Have a little concept with everyone

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
What I did

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
What kind of field

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Now it's time to enter my topic

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
My doctoral research

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Mainly doing experiments

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
To explore

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
When I have these aquatic plants in the water

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
It's not looking at the river now

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Is looking at aquatic plants

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
What about those plants

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
How to change the flow of water in physics

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And then change the flow of water

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Nisa's whirlpool and the glory of the air

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
But in fact

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
The bottom bed of Nisa

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And the transmission

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
And the glory of the air

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It's always been an environmental scientist

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
A very concerned research topic

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
That's because Nisa's flush and transmission

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It's going to change the river for a long time

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Or wetland or river

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Or the terrain of the coast

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
In fact, in these places

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Many different aquatic plants grow

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And then the other side is

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
The amount of water

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
In fact, this importance

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Basically everyone should be very clear

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
We can simply use

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
These two pictures as examples

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Like the left picture

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
It means that the amount of water is relatively low

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
The right picture is a fully nourished lake

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
So we can clearly find

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
When the amount of water is low

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
This lake will greatly limit

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
The development of the entire creature and the entire ecosystem

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
On the contrary, it is a system

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
In an environment where nourishment and air exchange are strong

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
The development of aquatic life will be relatively smooth

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
And the ecosystem will be more diverse

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
In addition

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
The transmission between air and water

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
It will also affect the entire regional climate model prediction

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Like IPCC

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
We call it the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
The study report in 2001

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It specifically pointed out that

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
River, lake, etc.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
The water and air exchange in the inland water area

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
This is on the water and air exchange

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
There is a large proportion of this emission

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
So it takes more research

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
To make further and more accurate estimates

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And then do some more accurate

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Modeling to do the whole

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Especially the correction of the regional climate model

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
But the important thing is

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
In the case of inland water

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
In fact, aquatic plants play a very important role

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And their distribution is very wide

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
But past research

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
In fact, there is no consideration of the existence of aquatic plants

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Most of the time, it's just a simple stream

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Then in a river with nothing at all

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Run

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
In fact, more and more scientists have found

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
This kind of simplification is actually not very

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Does not match the real nature

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
So there are those errors

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
So in the past few decades

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
In fact, many geophysicists

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
They will start

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Find a way to discuss

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Aquatic plants affect the environment

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The impact of this stream

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Then we can roughly put

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The impact of aquatic plants is divided into two categories

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
That one category is when we

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
When there are plants in the water

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It will block the whole stream

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
The whole operation

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So it will reduce the flow rate of the river

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Then change the flow of the entire river

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
The second point is that it has changed the flow

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
So the turbulence in the water will increase

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Here is a simple example

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It can be seen from this video

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
When a stream flows from left to right

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Then if there is a pillar in the middle

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
When it's in the middle

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Behind this pillar

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
There will be two turbulent currents in different directions

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
At the same time

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Assuming that there are many in the water

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
A plant group like this

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Then the whole stream will basically be

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Various turbulence

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And become very chaotic

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
In addition, past research has also proposed

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
That is, with the density of the plant group

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And the proportion of plants immersed in the water

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
The strength and characteristics of the flow

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And the flow will be completely different

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
The so-called immersion ratio refers to

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
The proportion of plants in the water

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So it can be from

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
It's completely in the water

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
We call it Emergent Vegetation

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's the whole thing that emerges in the water

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
And then it's submerged in the water

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
That's Submerge

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Under different immersion ratios

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It will produce

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
The size of the vortex

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
And the whole

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
The flow will be completely different

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
The main generated turbulence

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Can be divided into two according to their magnitude

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
One we call

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Stem Scale Turbulence

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
That's mainly the turbulence in the video

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's like

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Behind each plant

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Generate horizontal rotation

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
This vortex

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So then the scale of this vortex

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's with my plant

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
This pillar

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Uh, the plant is called the meridian

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
But if it's a pillar

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It's related to its diameter

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes, so we call it

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Stem Scale Turbulence

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
The other one is

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
When my whole plant group

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Dive into the water

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Just like this picture

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
When you dive into the water

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
The top of the plant group will be because

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
The speed of the upstream and downstream water flow is different

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Because there is no plant on the top

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So its water flows faster

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
The downstream

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Because there are obstacles

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
So the water flow is slower

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
What about the upstream and downstream flow differences

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Will produce a

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Vertical ratio

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It's a vertical

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Rotating vortex

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
What about this vortex

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Its magnitude is

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
It will be bigger

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Compared to my plant root

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
What caused the stem scale to be bigger

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
That's what we call

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Uh, Canopy Scale Vortex

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
And then these two magnitudes of the vortex

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Will be in the water

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Transmitted to the surface of the water

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Or even the bottom of the bed

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
To affect the water surface

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
The rate of erosion

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
With the bottom of the bed

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
The whole mechanism of sandblasting and floating

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yes

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
What about the main purpose of my research

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Is to do experiments

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
And then to understand

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Is the aquatic plant

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
How to influence

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
These two questions

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Is

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
It first changes the flow

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And then how does this flow affect

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
That's

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Uh, our Air Water

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Gas Transfer

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
And that's

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
The suspension of my bottom bed

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yes

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay, so what's next

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm going to introduce a little bit

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
My experiment method and settings

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Oh, yeah, that's it

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I don't know if you have any questions

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
That is

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
If you have any questions

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
You are welcome to interrupt me at any time

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That is

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Because it may be different fields

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And then sometimes it's too fast

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Is to put some

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Maybe general

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
General people don't understand

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Things to say

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Just bring it directly

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
So if you have any questions

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You are welcome to interrupt me at any time

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yes

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Uh, I have a question

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Ok

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Is

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Maybe before you start

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
This kind of rigorous

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Before the lab experiment

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
There will be some

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I have a question

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Is

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Uh, you do research in this area

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
In addition to

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Physics

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
And this kind of physical

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Basic science

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
To understand

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You will need to understand

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Aquatic plant

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Is it biological

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Or plant-related

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Background knowledge

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Basically

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
If

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
You have this knowledge

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
That's probably the best

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Because

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Uh

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
For example, when we set up the experiment

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
We will think about it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Uh, my plant

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
That one

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
What am I going to use to represent the plant

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That's like my experiment right now

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm using

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
I'll talk about it later

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I'm using a harder one

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
That kind of acrylic

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That hard

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Acrylic

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
It can represent

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Is a special plant

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
It's the plant

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
The plant is harder

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
That plant

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Harder

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
The state

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
We can have

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
There are several special species

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
And then if you understand this ecology

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
You will know

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
OK, these species

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Where is it mainly distributed

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Like a river mouth

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Or a more upstream river

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So we can use this knowledge

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
To design our experiment

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Let it go as far as possible

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Just in physics

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
With

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
With real

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
To match

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
It's either

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
It's you

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
It depends on whether you want to be flexible

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
The

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Aquatic plant

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Or

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Say

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
The kind of plant

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Yeah

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
So

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Uh, for me

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I dare not say

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I know a lot about ecology

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Because I am also

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I started to get in touch with this field during my PhD

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
So I started to go

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
With

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's like talking to ecologists

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So actually this is also quite

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
It takes a combination of cross-fields

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Actually in

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Uh, after the speech

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
I will

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Share some

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Very interesting topics

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Is that we have some

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Cooperate with biologists

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
And then do fish

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
With

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
With

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Water research

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I will add this later

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Um

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Understand

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Thank you

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
This is a very

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It's a very good question

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Ok

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Ok

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Then

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I will continue

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
So now I'm going to talk about my experiment

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Settings and methods

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
So basically

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
The aquatic plant I use

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Is a

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Circular aquatic plant

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
What about the water flow

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Is driven by two different

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Uh, the plate rotates in different directions

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
To drive

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
And then we can use

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Control the speed of the plate rotation

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
To control the flow of different water flows

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
That

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
This one

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Is my aquatic

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Uh

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Is the photo of the experimental aquatic

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
So basically

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
This is not very big

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
It's the whole

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Uh

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
The section of the test

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It's about 200 centimeters long

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
And then the whole width

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
It's actually only 15 centimeters

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
So in this experiment

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I just mentioned

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I use a lot of acrylate

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
To simulate a plant with a higher hardness

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
That experiment

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
In fact, I also have

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Do experiments with softer plants

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
But in this study

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
We mainly focus on

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I mainly want to share with you today

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Is

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Simulate some of the results of harder plants

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
In addition to that, we are at the bottom of the bed

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Also laid a 10-centimeter layer of sand

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Is to simulate

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Is the natural river

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Natural river state

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Because there will be sand at the bottom of the bed

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Otherwise, how do I see the whirlpool of sand

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Yes

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
So I just

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I also laid a layer of sand

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
And then finally

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I put it

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Uh

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Test

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Is to test

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Water flow rate and

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Measurement instrument of nutrient concentration

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Let me tell you a little bit about it

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
I use it to measure

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Uh, the water flow rate tool

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
We call this system

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Called PIV

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
The full name is Particle Image Velocimetry

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So the whole system is basically

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Made up of three important components

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Is

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
First of all, we have to put it in the water

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
We call it Neutral Volume

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Powder particles

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
The so-called Neutral Volume means

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Uh, the density of its particles

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Has to be about the same as water

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Then it can float evenly in the water

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
And flow along the water

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Then we need a high-intensity laser

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
To illuminate these powder particles

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
And then finally

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
A high-speed camera

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
To capture

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Each time point

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The location of each powder particle

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
That's like

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
This picture is

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Uh, my whole raw image

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Photos taken

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
So these points

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
The highlights are actually those powder particles

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
And then what happens next

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Once we have each time point

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
After the location of each powder particle

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
We can compare

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
It's the first two

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Uh, in the first two images

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Different time points

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
The relative location of the powder particles

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
And then calculate

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
The direction and distance of these particles moving

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
And then we'll

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Because we know

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
We can shoot us

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Uh, it's the camera

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
The time frame

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
The frame rate

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So we know the frame rate

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
We know how much time it takes

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Between each frame

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
And then we have this

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Displacement

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
We can go

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Calculate the speed of its movement

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And then with these fluids

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's these fluids

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
The movement speed of the powder particles

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
We can use it to represent

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It's different locations

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
The flow rate of the water

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
As for how to measure the rate of surface oxidation

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
We are in the water

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Put it in what we call

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
This chemical substance called hyaluronic acid

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
That hyaluronic acid

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
It will, uh, melt in the water

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
To react with the oxygen molecules in the water

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And then it consumes the water's oxygen

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And then when the oxygen in the water is exhausted

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
What about the time?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We can use the right picture

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It's this picture

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Uh, the oxygen concentration

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
To monitor the entire process of reoxidation in the water

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
And then

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
And through

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It's the time it takes to reach the saturation concentration

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
To calculate the whole

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The rate of surface oxidation

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
How much

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
That

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
In addition to oxidation and flow rate

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
What about

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
We're going to set up another set of experiments

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
To calculate the entire bed

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's, uh,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
The concentration of nitrogen in the water

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
How to do it

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
We are through lighting

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
And then by the brightness of this image

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
To distinguish

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
It's the position of the nitrogen particles

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
And then calculate

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
It's the concentration of different nitrogen particles in the water

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
That's like this video

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
We can see

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
The nitrogen particles that are suspended

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It's going to be on the white projection screen

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
It's a little bit of a reflection

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And then we can set a threshold

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And then we're going to determine that every pixel

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
It's

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
What's its intensity

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
And then this threshold

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
If it's higher than this threshold

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Then these

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
These pixels we'll

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Just treat it as

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Uh, water

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Because it's white

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
But if it's lower than this threshold

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It means it's this little bit

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Particles

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
And then we're going to set it up

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
It's the nitrogen particles

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
And then

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
And then you can calculate

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
The entire water

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
The concentration of nitrogen in this water column

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Okay, so

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Uh, according to the PIV

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
We measured

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
We got the two sides of the flow

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
And then there's the image analysis

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
To analyze the concentration of suspended nitrogen

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
That's why

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
With these two things

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We can try to answer the first question

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Is

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
How does the aquatic plant affect

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
The bottom layer of the river

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Before we discuss this question

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Let's first understand

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
How does the river wash the bottom layer

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
The nitrogen is washed up

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
What is the mechanism of this nitrogen suspension

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
In fact, this principle

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Uh, it's a little bit like this

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
When the storm comes

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
How do people get blown up

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, it's

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Uh, it's actually the speed of the fluid

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
It's about the pressure

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So we can put the picture

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
What about this object in this picture

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Imagine it's a person

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Or nitrogen particles

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
That's because the bottom layer has friction

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
So generally speaking

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
When you get close to the bottom layer

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
The flow of wind or water is relatively small

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
The further away from the bottom layer

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
The higher

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
In fact, it flows faster

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
When the fluid is through the human body

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Or when the nitrogen particles

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The upper flow rate is faster

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
The lower flow rate is slower

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So, uh, it's actually like

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
How does the plane take off

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
This Bernoulli

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Uh, this principle is a bit similar

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
That

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
The pressure above will be smaller

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
The pressure below is greater

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
So provide a

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Because of this pressure

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
It provides an upward force

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
But

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
What we need to understand is

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
General air and water

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Basically

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
It's a chaotic mess

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
That's what I just mentioned

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's like a typhoon

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
The wind basically

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
It won't keep blowing

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
That's what we look at

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
In terms of speed profile

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
In fact, this profile

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It's an average speed profile

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
When the wind speed is low

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
People basically don't move

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
It's a momentary rush

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
To blow people

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Just give

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Blowing is

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Uh, even leaving the surface

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
So there's actually more research

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Point out that

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
What about the mechanism that actually starts the nitrogen floating

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's a momentary high-intensity water flow

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That's what we call

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
The nest flow or the mess flow

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
What about the general river flow

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
The mess flow is mainly caused by the friction of the bottom bed

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
And we're going to go through this

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The mess flow generated by the friction of the bottom bed

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
With its own

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Nitrogen is the speed of the sink

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
To make a balance between the two

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And then we can push out a

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
To predict a different flow rate

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
The profile of the river's nitrogen concentration

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Then it's like this profile

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Basically, it's based on this theory

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
It's been pushed out

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And then with the previous experiments

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The density of these nitrogens

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
It's basically a match

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
But I just mentioned a little bit

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
What about the past model

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Only suitable for considering

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
There is no aquatic plant

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
There is no structure

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Once there is a aquatic plant in the water

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
That's like I mentioned before

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
The whole flow will change

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
So what about my entire speed profile

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
It won't look like this

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
That's from recent research

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
It's when there's a plant in the water

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Ah, this theory of nitrogen selection

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
The model is not suitable

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
That's because the old model only considers

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Just like I just mentioned

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Only consider the bottom bed

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
The effect of the friction of the bottom bed

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
What about the picture on the left

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
The horizontal axis represents the size of the bottom bed

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
And then the vertical axis represents the flow rate of the river

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
That's a very obvious trend

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
You can see that when the flow rate of the river is greater

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
The more nitrogen is transmitted downstream

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
But that's what we found

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
What about these color data points

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
It means that there is a plant

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
So this prediction mode

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
It can only be in line with

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
These points are without any plants

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
So this thing tells us

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
When we have aquatic plants

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
We must consider at the same time

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
The flow rate produced by aquatic plants

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So if we look at the picture on the right

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
It's when we consider the bottom bed sensitivity at the same time

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
What about the flow rate produced by plants

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
These data in the case of plants

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
It matches the model of this theory that we modified

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
In addition to this

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
What about the overall flow rate effect

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's not just two plus

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
In fact, in addition to considering the bottom bed sensitivity

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
In addition to the flow rate produced by aquatic plants

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
The interaction between the two flows

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
It will produce an additional flow structure

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That's what we call Coherent Structure

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
What about this structure

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
It's usually in the back of the plant

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Or the place before and after

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And then close to the bottom bed

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
So this animation on the left is

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
One of our experiments

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Red means faster

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Blue means slower

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Then we can find that the inside of the plant group

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It's the inside of these pillars

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The water flow is actually very chaotic

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And then when you get close to the bottom bed

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
There will be some high-speed water flow

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
It's the red part

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
And then with more sand grains

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
So we have to put this model

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
What we call Coherent Structure

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
This kind of interaction can also be considered

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
So we are based on the plant

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The average speed of the internal water flow field

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
A new theoretical model

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And then the whole river

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Divided into two layers of structure

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
What about the average speed of the upper layer

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Close to the fixed value

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
So we call it the average speed layer

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
And then in this layer

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It's basically the sensitivity that can be ignored

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
So in this layer

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
The main mechanism of sand grains is from

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
We just mentioned that the gold of the plant

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
The back of this

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
This kind of water level flow

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
What about the water flow at the bottom

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
We call it the boundary layer of the bottom bed

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
So in this layer

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
It's the mechanism of sand grains

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
It's actually mainly from the bottom bed sensitivity

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
And the gold of the plant

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
And I just mentioned

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The Coherent Structure of the interaction between the two

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So all three of them have to be considered

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
At the bottom of this place

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
And then finally

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
What about the new theoretical model

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
With us in the water

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
What about the data obtained from the experiment

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
The three pictures represent

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
The density of sand grains under different currents

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
The circle is our experimental data

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And the virtual line is our theoretical model

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
So the new theoretical model is roughly

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It's in line with the experimental data

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
So we can look forward to

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
This new theoretical model

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Can replace the old model

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
It helps people to be more accurate

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
To predict

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It's in the case of aquatic plants

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
The density of sand grains

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
This will help us

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
The whole river, lake, wetland

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Those sand transmission

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
And the geological environment

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
There is a more accurate prediction and understanding

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Okay, so we're done with the bottom bed

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And then we go back to the surface

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
We're going to see

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
The flow structure produced by the plant group

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
How does it affect the surface of the water

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
The process of gas transmission

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
What about the gas transmission of the water table

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
It's mainly controlled by three big mechanisms

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
And one of them is

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
I've been emphasizing

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It's the structure in the water

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
That is, the vortex in the water

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Wait a minute

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
My pointer seems to have run away

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Okay, that's it

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
What about the other two main mechanisms

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
It's the wind on the surface

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
The mechanism of this blow

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
And then there's my wave motion

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
It's my wave

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
But in general

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
In larger water bodies

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Like lakes and oceans

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Water table wind and waves

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
It's the main influence

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Surface gas transmission and erosion mechanism

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
But for smaller water bodies

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Like rivers or smaller lakes and ponds

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
In fact, the flow structure in the water

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It's the main influence mechanism

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
And that's what I'm going to do

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
The main part of the study

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
What about the old theory

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
In fact, it's mainly for simplified rivers

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
That is, again

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That is, they ignored the water body influence again

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And this model is

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
It's like this

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
What about the surface of the water

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
There's a very thin layer of fusion

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
And then the air in the water table

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
You can use this

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
This mix

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
In this fusion

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
By spreading

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
From the surface through the fusion

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Transmitted to the water

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
And the flow produced by the bottom layer

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
That is, the whirlpool in the water

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
There's a certain chance

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Transmitted to the water table

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
And then to increase the entire surface layer

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The spread of fusion air

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
And then it increases the whole air

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
The speed of transmission in the interface

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
What about this model

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It must be based on different flows

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Make some assumptions to estimate

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That is, the water

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The time period of the whirlpool transmission to the surface

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That is, behind us

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
This TS

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
What about this TS

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
It basically follows different flows

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And there are different estimations

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So in the case of plants

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
We have to do more for this old model

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Especially this TS

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
To make further corrections

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
In order to discuss the distribution of different plant groups

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
The impact on the flow

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
We experimented with three different plants

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
That is, one is what we call fully emergent

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It's basically my emergence ratio

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
That's one

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And then there's the other half

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Half of it is in there

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And then there's the main part

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Most of it is in there

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
These two situations

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
So there are three different kinds

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
And then we also set

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The density of two different plant groups

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
The main reason is like I mentioned before

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Is that the difference in density and density

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Will directly lead to different flows

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And then it affects the structure of the entire fluid

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
And the transmission rate of the surface gas

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And then there's the experiment of each group

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
We also control the flow of different water

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
And then reach different Reynolds numbers

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
And then we're going to talk about the structural characteristics of the flow

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It's a little stuck here

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay, so this is our

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
PIV primitive image animation

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
And then from this animation

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
In fact, we can already see

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
That's the difference in the flow rate

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Under different immersive ratios

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Like the picture on the left

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
It's fully emergent

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
And then we can see

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
These pink particles

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It's going to be a little messy

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
There's one behind the plant

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
We can actually see

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
It has a kind of vortex

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A vortex of rotation

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But in the other two

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
It's the immersion ratio

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
When it's less than one

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
We can see that

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
It's above the plant group

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
There will be a more vertical motion

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And then we're going to

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Do the flow rate analysis for it

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And then it's even more obvious

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
It's in a fully emergent situation

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Basically, the flow is very messy

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And then the entire flow rate

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
The profile is basically the same

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
But when I was in the water

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
What about the bottom and the top

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
There will be a very obvious difference

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So you can see that the top is basically red

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
It means that the flow rate is faster

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
What about the bottom

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Our flow rate is slower

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
The profile of the average flow rate

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
It's even more obvious

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
You can see this feature

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
In addition to the data of the speed plant

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
We can further use this speed plant

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
To calculate and quantify the flow rate

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The strength in each flow field

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
The blue area represents

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
The area with a stronger strength

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
And the red one means that the flow rate is weaker

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
So when the growth ratio is 1

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's in a fully emergent situation

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The main flow comes from the stem scale

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That's what I just mentioned

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And then the distribution of these flow rates

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
It's basically relatively even

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
It also represents the flow rate of the entire flow field

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
It can be represented as

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Use the average value of the flow field

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
To represent

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Because it's basically distributed more evenly

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
But when the growth ratio is less than 1

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
The top of the plant group

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Because of the difference in flow rate between the two layers

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
It produces a very strong canopy scale

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
It's more dominant in the whole system

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
So at this time, the entire flow rate of the flow field can be used

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
The maximum value of the flow rate

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
That is, it is usually at the top of the plant group

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
To represent

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Make a more dominant value

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
Then go back to our Modify model

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
So according to the result of our experiment

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
We use different characteristics

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
The strength of the flow to change the original theoretical model

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Then I don't think I'm going to do it one by one

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Just explore the details of the theory

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Then I quickly summarize this point

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
That is, when the ratio of the plant group is 1

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
In a fully emergent situation

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
We use the average strength of the flow rate of the entire flow field

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
To estimate the previous one

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
That is, the time of this stream transmission mentioned earlier

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Then finally get this new Modify model

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
When the ratio of the plant group is less than 1

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
We use the maximum flow rate of the flow field

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
To estimate the time of this stream transmission

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Then finally we compare the theoretical model

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
The prediction and experiment data of the theoretical model

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
The left picture represents the case where the ratio is 1

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
The right picture is less than 1

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Then the horizontal axis represents the strength of the water flow

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
The strength of the flow structure

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Then the vertical axis represents the gas transmission

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
That is, the rate of oxidation

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
So the general trend is

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
The stronger the flow rate in the water

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
The faster the oxidation rate of the water table

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
But there is an interesting phenomenon here

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
We can find that in two cases

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
When the Reynolds number is less than a certain value

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
The rate of prediction of the entire model will be slower

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
It's slower, sorry

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Then when the Reynolds number is greater than a certain value

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
The rate of prediction is shakier

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Do you remember the beginning

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I mentioned it when I introduced the flow

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
The so-called Reynolds number

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
It is a parameter used by scientists to describe how chaotic the flow field is

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
What about the range of different parameters?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
It can describe whether the flow field is in the flow

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Overflow or flow state

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
So this result tells us

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
What about the mechanism of the transmission of the entire surface of the gas

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Will be affected by the flow state of the flow field

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
The flow state of the flow field is changed

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
So let's summarize

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
The whole study tells us a few points

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
That is, the technical message

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
The first point is through our research results

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
We can know the existence of aquatic plants

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
First of all, it will reduce the flow rate of water

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
But at the same time, it will also increase the structure of the flow in the water

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Just make the water more chaotic

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Then it leads to sedimentation, subsoil sedimentation, whirlpool

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
There is also an increase in the transmission rate of surface gas

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
In addition, we are based on different plant groups

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
The ratio of sedimentation and water flow interaction

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
The flow of this structure that produces different levels

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
We can propose a new physical model

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Then consider the impact of aquatic plants

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Then more precisely

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
To predict the mechanism of subsoil sedimentation and surface gas transmission

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Then these information

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
We hope that in the future

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
It helps to assess more accurately

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Ecology and the plan of aquatic engineering

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
With this whole image

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
It's 9.50 now

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Generally speaking, the speech is about an hour

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Is it?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yes

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
OK, I should have a little time at the end

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
So I'll take this time

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
To share some other interesting things

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
During the PhD

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
In addition to the previously mentioned

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Smaller aquatic plants

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
We are also using larger aquatic plants

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Like this kind of aquatic plants to do experiments

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Then we set the density to be higher

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Then the number of more aquatic plants

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
To explore the structure of the water flow and the problem of gas exchange at a larger scale

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I hope that we can discuss

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
The physical model proposed by the previous small-density experiment

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Is it the same

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Suitable for larger environments

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
After all, because our ultimate goal

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Is to apply this model

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
To the real-world environment of rivers and lakes

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Because we also know that experiments

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Always simplify

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
The phenomenon of the whole natural world

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
So if you can make your scale bigger

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Then make it closer to the natural world

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
It means that your model will be more convincing

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Yes, of course, we also hope

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Is that there can be some limited measurement data

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Then compare it with the data we experimented

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
Then expand the range of the whole model

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
To the scale of the real field

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
In addition, we also found

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Is that the position of the plant group

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
In fact, it will also affect the whole

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
The transmission of geothermal sand and the evolution of the terrain

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Like the image on the upper right

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
The pillar is randomly placed

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Then the pillar at the bottom right is regular

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Is what we call staggered

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
This kind of regular placement

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Then we compare the two videos

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It can be clearly found that

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
When the pillar is randomly placed

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
The bottom bed will flow like a wave

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
It's like a wave

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
But when the pillar is placed in a regular way

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
The bottom bed changes

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But it doesn't evolve like the wave above

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It's just a layer of sand

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
It's just a continuous downward transmission

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Then the other is the video on the left

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It shows that the sand particles

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Is that it follows

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
The flow structure produced by the plant in the water

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
There are different modes of movement

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Like some of them

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
We can see that it is going down along the whole bottom bed

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Some of them are what we call saltation

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It's a bouncing transmission

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Then some of them are directly suspended

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Then take it along the water

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
In fact, these are all very interesting

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
More basic physical problems

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Some scientists are also discussing

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Particles

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
How is it in the fluid

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
With the flow of different structures

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
To move

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
These basic problems

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Then during my doctoral class

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I was very lucky to participate

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
In addition to aquatic plants

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
We also discussed

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I just mentioned a question

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
In addition to discussing plants

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Also discuss the flow of water

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
The impact of another aquatic plant

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
That is fish

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
So the origin of the whole plan

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Let me introduce you a little bit

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
The origin of the whole plan

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Because of the West Coast of the United States

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
The current ecology

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Is seriously affected by foreign species

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That foreign species is Asian carp

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Asian carp

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Asian carp basically

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Midwestern

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
There is no land

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
So they react very quickly

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Then it will harm

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Some local species

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
So some biologists in the United States

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
They want to try to use

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Natural law

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
To naturally reduce the reaction of Asian carp

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Instead of just going straight

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Because now

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Basically advocate the so-called

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Natural process

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
On the way

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Cooperate with biologists

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
In the U.S. Geological Survey

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Is to put real fish eggs

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
To our aquatic plants

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Then our aquatic plants

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
This time the aquatic plants are used

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
We call it Turbulence Tank

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It is a

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
About one meter by one meter

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Then we can see

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
There is an iron grid

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Then there is a motor above

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Can control the vibration of this grid

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Then through this vibration

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Different intensity of turbulence

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Then we can see

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
When I know different turbulence

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
What is the survival rate of these fish eggs

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Because we know

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
The stronger the turbulence

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Basically speaking, the film of the fish egg

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
It is very likely to be destroyed

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Basically their hatching rate will be lower

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
So we do this

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Do this experiment

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
To explore

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
What is the survival rate

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Based on different scales or different intensities

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
This kind of turbulence

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Then provide some biologists

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Some insight to do some ecological work

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Then we also set different structures

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Like a stone

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
To simulate the flow of different environmental water

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Then we

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
The research here is for

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Just hatched

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Larvae

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Then there is the fish egg that I just mentioned

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Then look at

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
When there is a stone and then there is a stream

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
When it flows

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
These larvae

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
What kind of place do they like to stay

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
From here

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
We can clearly see

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
There are two large parts

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
One part is at the top

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
The other part is behind the stone

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Mainly because behind the stone

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Basically it flows slower

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
So those larvae

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
If you stay here

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Will be safer

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Then basically its survival rate will be higher

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
If it is higher

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The place above

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It basically flows straight down

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
But it is less

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
It's just above the stone

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Because here is basically

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
We just mentioned

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Like the turbulence of Caton-Piscot

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
In addition to the larvae

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
We also do adult fish

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Do adult fish

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Research on the reaction of different flow factors

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
In the video

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
We set up a

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Just a bigger pillar

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Then we can find that most of the time

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
This fish

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
He would prefer to stay behind this column

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Can be broadcast again

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Then we can see

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
This fish will follow

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Is the tail of our pillar

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
This tail

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
And then basically

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
It's like this

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
It can save its swimming energy

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Then

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Basically what we are doing here

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Are some more preliminary research

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
In the future

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Of course, more experiments are needed

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
To do further research

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Under various flow conditions

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Beneficial to the environment of fish

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And then

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
To better predict the ecology of fish

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
And development

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
During my Ph.D.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I am more fortunate to participate in these

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Quite interesting

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Different

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Biological-related topics

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I think

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
The time should be almost

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
So

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Thank you

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
My advisor during my Ph.D.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Then there is my whole

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Research group at UIUC

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Then basically my funding is from

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
My boss NSF's plan

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Then there is Taiwan and UIUC

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Joint fellowship

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
That's the last

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Q&A time

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
See if you have any questions

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Then I am also happy to

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Share more

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Information to everyone

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
If you are

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Environmental science or even ecology

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
If you are interested in water resources

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
You are welcome to contact me

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Ok then

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
That's it

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Oh, before everyone

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Before asking questions

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Please turn on the microphone

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Then we applaud again

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Thank you for bringing us

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Today's wonderful speech

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Thank you

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Ok

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Then welcome everyone to ask questions

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
You can directly turn on the microphone to ask questions

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Or type in the chat

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Or there is an icon next to it

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Then

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Let me ask a question first

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I am for

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Implement this model

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
You are a little curious

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Just because

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
After all, every river is different

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Or you design an experiment

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
The size of his tank

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Should be

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I hope it will be much bigger than you

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Implement this

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Analytical model

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
So it will

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Like a river

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
You won't make this thing

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Small to

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
H2O molecule

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Then you mentioned in it

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You will judge that there are plants here

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
No plants here

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
How far is the plant from the water

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So I may not catch it

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
But my guess is

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
This length scale

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
It's probably the same as the plant

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Is it about the same size?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Basically my scale

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It should be a plant group

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
So it's not just a group

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
A group of plants

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
So basically it should be

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Because my experiment is basically

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Your plant

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
There must be no way to implement

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
It's as much as reality

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It must be a

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Limited situation

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
But it should be noted that

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Because my tank is basically limited in size

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
So I can think of it as

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
A scale dump

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Physical model

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
So I'm on both sides here

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Basically belong to a

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Average scale

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
So you can think of it

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
As a plant group

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
For example

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
This experiment

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
You can think of it as a

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Very small river

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And there are these plants in it

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Like I just mentioned

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
How can I make sure

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I'm here

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
This thing

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Can really be applied

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
In fact, there is still a gap between this

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Because

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
In practice

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
It must be a simplified model

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
There are actually a lot of

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Empirical parameters

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
But these parameters

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
For us experimentalists

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
This parameter is all inside

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
It means we

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Physical based model

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Because basically

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Although my river is bigger

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But it still follows the same

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Fluid mechanics mechanism

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
But my empirical coefficient may be different

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
But I can make sure

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
My model

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
If it is based on this physics

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Then my river will also

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Follow this mechanism

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
So this is what I just mentioned

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
We hope to be able to do

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Larger model

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
How much is the difference between this

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Empirical coefficient

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
With my small river

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Then if we have

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Some limited measurements

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
We can be more clear

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
The curve of this empirical model

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Then these things

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Can actually be used as

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
A numerical simulation

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because basically

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
We have to do more

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
There must be no way

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So we have to rely on simulation

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
There must be someone

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Challenging

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
How can you ensure

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
The result of my simulation

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
With real experiments

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Or the real environment is the same

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
So at this time

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
You have to rely on experimental validity

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Then give it some useful parameters

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Let it do more

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Prediction

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Correct

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know if I answered your question

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Basically part of the answer

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Answered my second question

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
My first question is completely answered

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
My next question is actually

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
If you want to put your model today

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Throw in a simulation

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Then for example, I will

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Simulate a river

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Is there such a plan?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Which one is safer to do experiments?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
You have a plan to take data

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Then compare

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Simulation

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
My previous group is currently

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
No

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Because my previous group is basically

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Mainly focused on aquaculture experiments

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
But we have

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Other schools are talking about cooperation

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Some other schools

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Their group

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Their strong point

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Is doing limited survey

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Then they may be near the school

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
There is one

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
There may be a similar type of river in the campus

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Then they may

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Use that river as a sample

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Then go there to pick up points

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Want to compare with our experiment

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Then basically

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Simulation now

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Is already

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
It's amazing to calculate

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Complex

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Fluid problem, but it still has a limit

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I just talked about it

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Completely

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Copy the real situation

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Especially aquaculture

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
How do you put

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Aquaculture

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Implement to your model

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
So this is why

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I just said that we can provide useful parameters

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
So basically

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I just mentioned that aquaculture has two main

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
One is to reduce flow

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
So it will provide a drag

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Then that drag

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I can give it a drag coefficient

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Then the other one is that my aquaculture will produce a flow

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
What about the flow

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
You can also give it another parameter

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Then throw these two parameters

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Into my numerical simulation

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I can go through

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Actually

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Build a grid

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Build these vegetation

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
I can do parameterization

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
To get close results

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
This is the current

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I know numerical model

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
What they are doing

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
So they still need

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
This data we experimented

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
To give them useful parameters

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Then let them do simulation

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I understand

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I think it's very interesting

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Do you have any other questions

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I have a question

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Yes

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Actually I'm curious

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
What you will do in

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Aquaculture

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Because you will

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
You will do numerical simulation in aquaculture

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Related things

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I should do simulation

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Yes

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Then your simulation

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Actually I have a follow-up

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Previous question

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
You talked about

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
You are in the system

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
You will have a

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Similar

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Basically you see yourself

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Average scale

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
In fact, many simulation methods

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Will use multi-scale

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
You may have different

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Dynamics

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Dynamics

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
But you

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
May look at the problem

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I don't know

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
In aquaculture

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Multi-scale simulation

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
How far

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
This question is very good

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I answer first

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
What I want to do in aquaculture

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Basically I should be in aquaculture

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Do simulation

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Because there is a good

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Calculation computation resources

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
But I may

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Sorry

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I may not continue

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I should not continue to do experiments

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Because they seem to be there

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
As far as I know, there is no experimental equipment

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Yes

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
As for doing simulation

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I'm not sure if I can do aquaculture simulation

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm still

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Because I just uploaded

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So I still don't know

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Not yet

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Future topic

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
But about you just mentioned

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Multi-scale problem

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Because basically I

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I used to have similar experiences

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
In fact, doing

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Simulation of aquaculture

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
A very important problem is that I just mentioned

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Turbulence model

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Because Turbulence is basically very small

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
So if I want to be precise

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
To

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I want to be precise to simulate this

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Turbulence flow

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
My grid must be thin enough

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
The result of the physics I came out

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Physics

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Meaning

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But there is a problem

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
My grid must be very thin

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
But if I have to do like

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Large-scale simulation

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I can't have so much resources

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Because I want to be very thin and I have to

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Really big domain

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Then my computation cost is very large

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
So

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
They will do some of the parameters I just mentioned

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Process

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
When I have a small AD

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
How will my AD affect the flow

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Then it may affect its drag

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It may affect the flow of energy

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Then I use this

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Parameterization to give

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
To the large scale model

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
To do simulation

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Then I can skip the small scale simulation

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Directly use large scale

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Then you just talked about multi-scale

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Now there is indeed

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Because some people found out

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I'll go back to a picture

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I mentioned it earlier

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I remember there is a picture

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Is in

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Wait a minute

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Find it

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
This

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
OK this

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We can see

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I just mentioned

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Most of the rivers

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
The flow is at the bottom

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because the friction of the bottom bed

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
This is produced by the gravity

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So the flow here is very strong

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Now the scientists have found

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I just use the parameterization process

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
To do the whole river

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Simulation may have some errors

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Because if they

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Want to see more detailed things

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
In the bottom part of the bed, they use large scale

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Basically your grid is too thick

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
The things you see

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It must not be thin enough

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
They are doing multi-scale

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
They put the bottom bed

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The grid is very thin

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Then I can solve it

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Really solve this

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The flow of air

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But what about the grid above me

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I know their flow is not strong

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So they can directly use

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Parameterization to transmit

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So just do it

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
To merge

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
There is indeed such a

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Simulation

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
In fact, this can also be applied to the atmosphere

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Because if you want to do the boundary layer

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Is that I am far away

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
The atmosphere on the surface

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Basically they are doing

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Large AD Simulation

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So they are not solving

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They are also a parameterization process

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Then it's not really solving

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Very close to the surface

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But if they want to see

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
For example, these urban buildings

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
The shape of these currents

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
They may put

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The grid inside is very thin

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Then rely on parameters

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
To transmit this information from the bottom bed

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
From the bottom to the top

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I don't know if I have answered your question

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
But this question is very good

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It is indeed the current scientists

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Especially

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
People doing application math

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
What are you doing

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Because they are good at doing some

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Network grid

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Network grid information

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
There is no problem

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I don't know if anyone else has any questions

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
If there is no problem

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I am the host of today's speech

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Let's talk a little bit

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Is in the chat part

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You can see that I just put it up

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Join members

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Then there is also tracking our Facebook

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Then how to get today's

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Participate in this talk badge

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Method of some links

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Then at the same time

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
There is also a proof of participation

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
The keyword used today is also typed on it

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
That is valid within two hours

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Ok, before we finish

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Please turn on the microphone

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Warm applause again

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Thank you for bringing us today's wonderful speech

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Thank you for your participation

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Welcome everyone

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
If you have other questions

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You can contact me by email

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I am very happy to share with you

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
My research

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Thank you

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Ok, now I put that
