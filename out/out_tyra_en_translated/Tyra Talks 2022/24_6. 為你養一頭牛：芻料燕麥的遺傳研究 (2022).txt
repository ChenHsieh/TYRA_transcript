I graduated from NTU's Agricultural Department.
I'm not here to promote NTU's Agricultural Department,
but I just want to let everyone know
why I do this
and what kind of background it has with us.
So, many people may not have heard of NTU's Agricultural Department.
Many people have heard of Yuan Yi Department
or other Department of Insectology,
or the Department of Science and Technology in the Agricultural Department.
But you may not know much about the Agricultural Department.
But for me,
I think the coolest thing about the Agricultural Department
is that it studies
how to understand the science of our crops.
So, you see, I put here
some of the main grains in the world,
and some of the grains that Taiwanese may not be so familiar with.
For example, corn is very familiar to everyone in Taiwan.
Wheat may not be so familiar.
There are all kinds of beans.
So, it should be wheat.
Then,
Taiwan may be more familiar with rice, rice,
or potatoes, which are not commonly eaten, but may be the main potatoes.
In fact, these are all in the field of agricultural research.
So, what we can study includes their genetics,
that is, we can study which genes have which functions
that may help these plants grow more.
We know which genes make these plants bloom early,
bloom late,
and which genes make it more resistant to water,
drought, or other pathogens.
This is what the genetics want to find.
Another part is biology.
There is another group of teachers and students in the Agricultural Department
who want to know, for example,
how the plants react to water.
It may make it grow taller,
or it may have some compounds in it
that can fight these pathogens.
Or, for example, when there is not enough nutrients,
what method does it need to use
to make these plants grow better in this bad environment?
The last part is statistics.
Statistics is because we need to do experiments,
but we need to have a conclusion that
the results of the experiments I did today
are true or false.
Is it because I just did a lot of experiments,
and I just saw this result,
or is it really because some species may really grow taller than other species,
or some species really produce more rice than other species?
We need to use statistics to verify our results.
So these are what the Agricultural Department does.
But for me, I think the most interesting thing is
how we improve different crops.
So, like we just talked about,
corn, rice, these are what Taiwan often does.
Just like Taiwan has been doing a lot of improvement factories,
we use different ways to improve these crops.
This is what I'm most interested in in the Agricultural Department,
and honestly,
this is also a topic under this framework.
In fact, the improvement of crops is not just what we think of now.
For example, we may want higher corn,
sweeter corn, or richer rice,
or more nutritious rice.
These things were actually done by people
thousands or tens of thousands of years ago.
So in the picture on the left,
you can see that this T-head is actually the ancestor of corn.
Then you will see that the one on the right is our current corn.
You can see that corn used to be a lot different from now.
There used to be a lot of branches,
and each branch would bloom.
Now the corn is a branch,
and there are only two of them.
Maybe one or two of them is the portion of the corn,
which is the part of the corn that we often eat.
So this is actually what the farmers or people in the past
were doing to improve the corn.
So through selection in the field or in nature,
they found that some corn could only grow one tree,
and then they would leave it and continue to grow it,
to see if they could continue to see this kind of performance in the next generation.
Gradually, after generation after generation of selection,
we let the corn from this kind of
originally only one,
one piece,
and then there are several seeds,
slowly become what we see now.
And the old corn,
it actually has a very hard shell on the outside.
In fact, it is very difficult to eat when eating.
That's how it is.
After many generations of selection,
it slowly became what we see now.
This corn has only one main piece,
and then there is a very full portion of corn,
and then there are a lot of granules on it.
This is through generation after generation of selection,
we select those corn that are closer to what we want generation after generation,
and then pass it on to the next generation,
to slowly improve this corn
to the ideal state we feel now.
So it's actually similar on the rice.
If you look at the earliest rice ancestors,
it's actually like grass.
It's laid on the ground,
and then its seeds may have different colors,
such as red or deep purple,
just like the purple rice you see now.
But that color may be on its shell.
The rice we eat now is the white rice inside after the shell has been peeled off.
But in fact, it has its shell on the original rice.
The shell of the rice that was grown before may be red,
because when it fell into the soil,
it would not be so obvious,
and it would not be eaten by birds and so on.
In addition,
the earliest wild rice
may still have a very strong landing.
After it blooms,
it will easily fall off from its shell.
So as long as you peel it off,
the seeds will fall off.
This is to make it easier to spread
and pass on when it is in the wild.
But this thing will be very inconvenient for our people to harvest.
Just like the 10-year-old rice,
after you harvest it,
you may only harvest 50% of the rice,
but the rest of the percentage will all fall into the field.
There is no way to harvest,
and it becomes the yield that you can easily harvest.
So,
like this,
this kind of feature with a high landing
has also been regarded as a target for selection for a long time.
We will start to select those mature rice
that are easier to stay on the rice plant.
Then keep it and continue to plant it.
I hope to see the rice that we grow generation after generation.
After maturing,
its shards are left on it instead of falling off.
So this is actually
from a long time ago.
After we started planting these crops,
people thought about improving the crops.
So it has evolved to the present.
In fact,
the matter of crop improvement is
very common,
very common in our various environments.
For example,
the photo I want to put here is
the different shapes of each tomato.
So you can see that there are different colors,
different fruit shapes,
and different hardness and different shapes.
This tomato is actually
the diversity of tomatoes themselves.
In fact,
the wild tomatoes outside
have these different polygons.
It's just that we cut it all up now.
Then you can see that
even in this species of tomatoes,
it also has such different characteristics.
What does this mean?
This means that
you have this diversity.
In fact,
we can use a lot of things.
For example,
today,
everyone thinks that big tomatoes can't be eaten.
Then we start to
start to breed tomatoes
with smaller fruit shapes.
We find smaller tomatoes
in this way.
Then continue to breed.
Let the later generations of tomatoes become smaller and smaller.
It becomes closer to what we think
is just the amount of a meal.
Or you think that
if you see red tomatoes
on the table today,
it doesn't look good.
But in fact,
there are these yellow tomatoes in the wild.
Then we will try to
breed these yellow tomatoes
with red tomatoes.
Can we leave some yellow tomatoes?
Then it becomes a fixed species.
After that,
when we eat tomatoes,
there will be red and yellow.
Or everyone knows that
if you want to eat fries,
some people will eat ketchup.
These ketchups are actually
selected by special selection.
Because it needs to be able to
be processed.
Yes, it may need
some time to process.
In addition, you may expect
ketchup to have some
special flavors.
So you will need to
take some special-flavored tomatoes
and fry them
to breed some
special-flavored tomatoes
suitable for processing
into ketchup tomatoes.
So in short,
our idea of
plant improvement
is actually
to use these
different types of species
that we already know
to use this
different arrangement
to combine the features we want
and then breed these
species that we think
people want.
So why are we
looking at
Taiwan's oats today?
This...
This...
Okay, so...
In Taiwan, if you
buy a can of milk,
about 2 liters of milk,
you have to pay $158.
But after I came to the US,
I was surprised.
Why? In the US,
this is about 4 liters of milk.
It only costs about
$100.
This is the price before tax,
but as long as it's about
$100,
you can buy the same amount of milk.
This price difference...
When I came to the US,
I was surprised.
Why is Taiwan's milk
so expensive?
I know that in Taiwan,
for example,
Taiwan's market is relatively small.
Or in Taiwan,
Taiwan's cows are imported.
Cows may not be native to Taiwan,
so it's more difficult to take care of them.
But why is it so expensive
to raise cows in Taiwan?
And then,
how come the production cost
of these fresh milk
is so high in Taiwan?
So actually,
Taiwan's fresh milk
Taiwan's fresh milk
production cost is very high.
Of course,
it doesn't matter
the various reasons I just mentioned.
For example,
Taiwan's market is relatively small.
Or Taiwan's milk cow...
Taiwan's environment is hotter,
so it's not suitable for milk cow production.
These are all related.
But from the perspective of agriculture,
there is one thing
that we can...
that we can
take advantage of,
which is
the issue of pasture.
In Taiwan,
there are a lot of these
livestock industry,
such as
sheep
and cattle.
In fact,
they need a lot of
pasture every day
to feed
these animals.
So,
for example,
if I remember correctly,
the amount of pasture
for sheep and cattle
is actually ten times less.
For example,
if your sheep
eat five kilograms a day,
your cow
will eat 50 kilograms of grass a day.
So,
in fact,
these cows and sheep
have to eat every day.
In addition to eating feed,
they must also need
some
fiber.
Whether it's dry grass
or fresh grass,
these cows can eat it.
In addition,
since they are all animals,
they can't just eat that feed.
That feed is
without fiber.
There is no way
for them to reproduce.
So,
you must provide
some
fresh grass
or dry grass
so that these cows can eat
and then reproduce.
This is one of the
normal
breeding
recipes
they normally
feed.
But the problem is
that
you can see
the news
I got today
says that
currently,
the imported
pasture
is 12 yuan per kilogram.
If you produce
Taiwan's own
pangula grass,
it's about 6 to 7 yuan.
It means that
the imported
is actually
twice the price of Taiwan.
This is actually
the news
of 2016 and 2017.
As far as I know,
the price of
Taiwan's imported
pasture
has always been
higher and higher.
The reason is, of course,
regardless of
the cost of transportation,
the price of oil
is getting higher and higher,
or the cost of
production abroad
is getting higher
and higher,
etc.
So,
the price of
imported
pasture
has always been
higher and higher.
So,
Taiwan has always
hoped that
we could
produce our own
pasture
to meet
the needs
of Taiwan's
own
pasture industry.
But you can see
that
it seems that
Taiwan can
rely on
different types
of grass
or different
types of grass,
or like
corn can
also be
one of the
sources of
feed.
So,
why does
Taiwan still
need to
rely on
these
imported
pastures?
The reason is
that
when you
plant
those
pasture
plants,
they need
enough
dryness.
So,
in Taiwan,
for example,
the area with
the most
pastures
is in
Yunlin and
Chiayi.
So,
they can
plant some
dry grass
that they
eat.
But
when they
harvest,
for example,
if they
plant in
summer,
they may
encounter
typhoon season.
So,
if they
plant in
winter,
they
may encounter
typhoon season.
So,
the reason
why
we need
to
rely on
these
imported
pastures
is because
of the
weather.
Even if
you have
some grass
that can
grow in
summer,
when it
grows in
the winter,
it
may not
grow
in the
summer.
So,
one of the
reasons
why
Taiwan
cannot
grow
grass
in a
stable
way is
because
it is
too wet
and
cold
in
the
winter.
So,
we
cannot
find
grass
that
can
grow
in
the
winter

So,
we
have
a small
pocket on
top of
it,
and
we
wrap it
in a
transparent
plastic bag
to
keep
the
seeds
moist
so
that
they
can
grow
in
the
winter
smoothly.
So,
when you
put it
in the
water,
it will
quickly
absorb
the
moisture.
When
the seeds
germinate,
they
can
grow
in
the
water
and
absorb
enough
moisture
to
grow.
So,
we
plant
different
seeds
in
different
environments.
So,
we can
make sure
that
at least
when I
let them
germinate
and measure
their
growth rate,
they will
grow in
the same
environment.
I can
control
the factors
of this
environment
so that
everyone
can compare
on the
same
scale.
So,
this is
one
seed at
a time.
I
put them
in the
germination
gap
so that
they can
grow
in
the
same
way.
When
we were
testing,
if you
just
put the
seeds
in
the
growth
gap,
we
can
measure
their
growth
rate.
So,
we put
them in
the
germination
gap
one
by one
and
let
them
grow
in
the
same
way.
When
they
grow

we
put
