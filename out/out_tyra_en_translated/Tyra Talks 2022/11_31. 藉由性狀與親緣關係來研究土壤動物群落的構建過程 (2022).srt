1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
From now on, we'll move on to the recording part.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll put this speech on YouTube as well.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Please go there to replay it.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Ding, please share your screen.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Okay, before I share my screen,

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
let me tell you who I am.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm Chen Dingwen.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you for the introduction.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm Dingwen Zhang, also known as Chen Dingwen.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think TARA is an interesting organization.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I like its purpose and purpose.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's to help young people in Taiwan

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and young scholars to have a platform

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,500
where we can communicate with each other

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
and get to know what everyone is busy with

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
and what research they're doing.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Why do I know about TARA?

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
It's because I saw it on Facebook.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,500
I don't know why, but one day,

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
this ad popped up and I thought,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is this a young scholar from Taiwan?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
It's T-Y-R-A.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
A is association, R is researcher.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
T-Y-Y is what?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Young scientist?

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Young researcher.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Y is young.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
T is Taiwan.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
I thought, as a young scholar from Taiwan,

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I should join a group like this.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
When I was a kid,

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,000
I spent most of my high school and college years in Taiwan.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I only had the chance to do research in Europe

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when I was a doctor.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
To me, TARA is a whole new world.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,000
I know that most of TARA's members

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
are from the U.S.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I wanted to meet friends from the U.S.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to see if they were doing ecological research like me

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,500
or if they were interested in soil,

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
or if they were doing research on evolution.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
I really wanted to meet these people,

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
so I joined this group and joined their activities.

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
For example, they have a teacher-student program.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,500
In this program, they help young people in Taiwan

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
and those of us who have gone abroad to study.

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
We help them on their way to study abroad,

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,000
so that they can make a difference.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We can also share with them

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
what we have learned and experienced

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
during our journey of studying abroad.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that they don't go down the wrong path

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
or find a better way

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to explore their future career development.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OK.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is a brief introduction to TARA.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to start my speech.

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
I don't want to make this

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
a formal and serious presentation.

61
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,500
If you have any questions

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
during my presentation,

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
you can ask me anytime.

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Of course, I know that

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
there may not be any formal questions.

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I also have a small request.

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
If you don't mind,

68
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
could you please turn on your camera

69
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
so that I can see your faces?

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
OK.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you don't mind,

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
could you please turn on your camera

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so that I can see your faces?

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to know if you find this part

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
particularly difficult to understand,

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
or if you find this part particularly boring,

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
or if you find this part particularly interesting.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can explain further.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you don't mind,

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
could you please turn on your camera

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
so that I can see your faces?

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OK.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to start my speech.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
First, I'm going to share my screen.

85
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm going to try to

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm going to try to

87
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
make good use of my time.

88
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I know that we only have one hour today.

89
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What do you see now?

90
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Do you see

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
the screen that I'm sharing?

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Lin, do you see the screen

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
that I'm sharing?

94
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Lin, do you see the screen

95
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
that I'm sharing?

96
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Lin, do you see the screen

97
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
that I'm sharing?

98
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
OK.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What you see now is

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the structure of the root of the plant

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
under the ground.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When you zoom in,

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
what do you see?

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Have you ever thought about this question?

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are there any creatures

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that we don't know

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
or haven't seen?

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm a soil ecologist.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm particularly interested

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in the evolution of

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
soil animals.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At the same time,

113
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm a mentor.

114
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm a mentor.

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I joined Taira's

116
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
mentor project.

117
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I also teach some college students,

118
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
even PhD students.

119
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm also a podcaster.

120
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm actually running a podcast

121
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
in 2020.

122
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
It's a bit scientific,

123
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
but it's called

124
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Do You Read Paper?

125
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
It's about soil ecology.

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Some of you may know me

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I'm glad you can

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
participate in my speech

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and listen to me

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
share my work and learning process.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is a typical

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
mountainous forest

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in Europe.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If I tell you

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that there are

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
thousands of

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
animals in this forest,

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
what can you see

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
from this photo?

140
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
In fact, you can't see them.

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Where are they?

142
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
They live

143
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
in these fallen leaves

144
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
and in the soil

145
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
below the fallen leaves.

146
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
If you dig

147
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
a piece of soil,

148
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
you can see

149
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
the surface of the soil.

150
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It's about 5 cm wide

151
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
and 5 cm deep.

152
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
5 to 10 cm.

153
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
In such a small space,

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you can see

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
a maze-like structure.

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can see

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the fallen leaves

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
at the top

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the solid soil

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
at the bottom.

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In such a small space,

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it will produce some

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
environmental kinks.

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
For example,

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
water has a kink.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When rainwater falls,

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the fallen leaves are wet

168
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
and the soil is full of nutrients.

169
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
In such a small space,

170
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
which is very different

171
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
in terms of

172
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
geological value and

173
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
environment,

174
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
it can accommodate

175
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
all kinds of

176
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
different creatures.

177
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
We call such a space

178
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
a soil.

179
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
But in academia,

180
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
we will also use

181
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
a term called

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
detritivores.

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We will assume that

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it eats these

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
plants and animals.

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So it is also called

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
a ten-year-old detritivores.

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Living in

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
this

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
maze

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
or fallen leaves,

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
think about

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
how many of these

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
animals

196
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
can survive

197
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
in a square meter

198
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
of soil.

199
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
We can see

200
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
10,000 to

201
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
2 million detritivores.

202
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
This is an amazing number.

203
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Think about how many grains

204
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
you eat a day.

205
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
But in such a

206
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
small space,

207
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
you can see

208
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
so many individual animals.

209
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
How many of these

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
animals can survive

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in a square meter of

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wendai Forest?

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Most of these

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
detritivores are very small.

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Although the size of

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
their body is large,

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
most of them are

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
smaller than 1 cm.

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Of course, there are also

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
centipedes, centipedes,

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and spiders that

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
are larger than 1 cm.

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We generally call

224
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
small centipedes

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
and small centipedes

226
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
as small centipedes.

227
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
However,

228
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
there are also

229
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
small centipedes

230
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
that are smaller

231
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
than 1 cm.

232
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
For example,

233
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
the centipede

234
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
is a small centipede,

235
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
which is

236
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
a small centipede.

237
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
We call it

238
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
a small centipede.

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
However,

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
also there are

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
medium and

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
medium-sized animals.

243
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why is it important?

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because when you

245
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
study animals,

246
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the first thing

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you will learn is

248
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
how to classify them

249
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
according to their size.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Medium-sized,

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
large-sized,

252
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and medium-sized.

253
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In addition,

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you can see these

255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
are also medium-sized.

256
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There are some special ones

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
like centipedes,

258
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
centipedes,

259
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and synphyrenes,

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
polyporynes,

261
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and scorpions.

262
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will not explain

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the term here,

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
otherwise we may not have enough time today.

265
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What other medium-sized animals

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
like centipedes and

267
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
centipedes are?

268
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They are also medium-sized animals.

269
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I like

270
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
centipedes very much.

271
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is a centipede?

272
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You should listen to my podcast.

273
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It should be in the fourth episode.

274
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have introduced

275
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
a science book on centipedes.

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let me explain it to you.

277
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Centipedes are not

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
centipedes.

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Centipedes are not insects.

280
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Strictly speaking,

281
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
centipedes are not insects.

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Centipedes can be considered

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
one of the six main species.

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Centipedes are now classified

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
as spiny centipedes.

286
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
In the past, centipedes were classified as spiny centipedes.

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Centipedes are now classified as spiny centipedes.

288
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Therefore, centipedes are the

289
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
close relatives of insects.

290
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How long has centipedes

291
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
existed in the history of

292
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
chemistry and evolution?

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.

294
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Centipedes are one of the

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
first species of centipedes

297
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
that came to the earth.

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Centipedes are one of the first species of centipedes

299
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that came to the earth.

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There are 9,000 species of centipedes in the world.

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We can classify them into

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
four different species,

303
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
30 different species.

304
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The first species is

305
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Entomorphia.

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It is a more obvious species.

307
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It is a more obvious species.

308
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Most of them live on the surface.

309
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Most of them live on the surface.

310
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Centipedes are

311
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
more expressive.

312
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Most of their food

313
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
comes from plants.

314
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Most of their food comes from plants.

315
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Another species is

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Podromorpha.

317
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This species has a more variable shape.

318
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Compared to the centipede

319
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Entomorphia,

320
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Podromorpha has a shorter spring.

321
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will talk about the spring later.

322
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Podromorpha is a species

323
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that lives in the soil.

324
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that lives in the soil.

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It does not need to use spring.

326
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It does not need to use spring.

327
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Most of the spring of Podromorpha

328
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is relatively short.

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There is also Nenepleona

330
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and Simipleona.

331
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
These two species of centipedes

332
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
are round and look like mice.

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I remember a classmate

334
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
who likes to study Simipleona.

335
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I remember a classmate

336
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And a Taiwanese student

337
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
studying the centipedes

338
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
at a teacher's lab.

339
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He specially studied the Simipleona,

340
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
who has symptoms

341
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
of this wood plant.

342
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The centipede

343
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
was very cute.

344
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Centipedes live onLAUND very cutely

345
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and grows on the surface.

346
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But the Nenepleona

347
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
looks like the Centipedes,

348
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but sticks out.

349
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So they mostly grow

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
on the surface.

351
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The centipede

352
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
has an important feature.

353
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Can you see my sign?

354
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I hope you can see it.

355
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The centipede jumps

356
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because it has a

357
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
bouncy structure

358
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
at its butt.

359
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This bouncy structure

360
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
helps it resist

361
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the attack of the centipede.

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So this thing

363
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
can make it leave

364
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
its original position.

365
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's why it's called a centipede.

366
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What does a centipede do?

367
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Centipedes have

368
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the ability to regulate

369
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
microorganisms in the ecosystem.

370
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Centipedes can also

371
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
affect the group of soil

372
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
or promote

373
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
or change the

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
fallout in the soil.

375
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It also affects the

376
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
chemical cycle of the soil

377
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and helps the plants.

378
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The role of the centipede

379
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in the ecosystem

380
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
is not only to be a

381
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
nourisher,

382
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
but also to be a

383
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
separator.

384
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The centipede can be

385
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a primary decomposer

386
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and a secondary decomposer.

387
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In addition to being

388
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
a primary decomposer

389
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and a secondary decomposer,

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
some centipedes can also

391
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
be a nourisher.

392
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Centipedes can also be

393
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
a nourisher

394
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
in the soil.

395
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
For example,

396
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
some spiders or

397
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
nourishing ants can eat centipedes.

398
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Centipedes have a softer body

399
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
compared to

400
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
other ants.

401
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Their body is softer,

402
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
so centipedes are

403
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
more delicious than

404
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
other hard ants.

405
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Nourishing ants, spiders, ants, etc.

406
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They are also considered

407
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
as food for other species.

408
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So,

409
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
this is the first part.

410
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I promised you half of the science,

411
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and the other half is

412
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
half of the academic.

413
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
OK, do you have any questions?

414
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let me see if there are

415
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
people I know online.

416
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, I see some people I know.

417
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'd like to say hello to all of you.

418
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If I didn't have time to say hello just now.

419
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay, I'll stop here.

420
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you have any questions,

421
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
or if you don't understand

422
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
what I'm saying,

423
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
please feel free to

424
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
ask now.

425
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll give you about

426
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
one minute to ask.

427
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Does it look like there are no questions?

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
OK.

429
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's continue.

430
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why do we want to know

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
about

432
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
centipedes?

433
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Since centipedes

434
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
are very important

435
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to the ecosystem,

436
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
why do we want to know

437
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
about centipedes?

438
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because centipedes

439
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
are very important

440
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
to the ecosystem.

441
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Of course, centipedes

442
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
have a certain impact

443
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
on the ecosystem,

444
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but we don't know

445
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
enough about them.

446
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So we want to know

447
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
who they are,

448
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
why they are here,

449
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and why these species

450
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
can survive here.

451
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why it's them,

452
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
not others?

453
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In 1975,

454
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Anderson

455
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
came up with an explanation

456
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to explain why

457
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
there are so many

458
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
centipedes in the soil.

459
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why are there so many centipedes

460
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
in the soil?

461
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
As I said,

462
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
there are tens of thousands

463
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
of centipedes per square meter.

464
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why are there so many

465
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
centipedes in the soil?

466
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why are there so many centipedes

467
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in the soil?

468
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He summed up

469
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that there are a lot of food resources

470
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
in the soil.

471
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Second, we don't know

472
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
what they eat.

473
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They eat different kinds of food.

474
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Third, the soil

475
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
has a high level of environmental sustainability.

476
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This was his idea

477
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in 1975.

478
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Now it's 2022,

479
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
almost 50 years later.

480
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What have we learned?

481
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How far has the research

482
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
progressed in the past 50 years?

483
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Is there any new hypothesis

484
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
or new technology

485
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that can help us

486
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
answer the question

487
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
why there are so many

488
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
centipedes in the soil?

489
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why are there so many

490
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
centipedes in the soil?

491
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you dig a soil

492
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and put it under a microscope,

493
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you can see

494
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
centipedes,

495
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
centipedes,

496
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
centipedes,

497
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and centipedes.

498
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ecology tells us

499
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that if you study biology in college,

500
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you may learn about

501
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
ecology, biophysics,

502
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and biophysics.

503
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Can we use the knowledge

504
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
we learn

505
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
or the knowledge

506
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
we learn in school

507
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
to explain the phenomenon

508
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
we see?

509
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is my research.

510
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I study the biological geography

511
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and their evolution

512
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
in the ecology of centipedes.

513
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The question asked in the biological geography

514
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
is what is the distribution pattern?

515
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is the biological geography

516
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
from low to high

517
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
along a certain gradient?

518
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
For example, along the gradient of the sea level,

519
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
along the gradient of temperature,

520
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
along the gradient of water.

521
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is the issue

522
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that biological geography deals with.

523
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What is the issue

524
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that the ecology of centipedes deals with?

525
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What is the interaction effect?

526
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Do they have some special features

527
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that can help them live in that place?

528
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What do they eat

529
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to maintain their species?

530
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The third issue

531
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
is the evolution of biology.

532
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The question asked in the evolution of biology

533
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
is what is the origin of biodiversity?

534
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How do these diversities

535
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
come from?

536
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Do they change from less to more

537
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
or from more to less?

538
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What changes

539
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
besides the shape of the body

540
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and the different features?

541
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Do they have some genetic basis?

542
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Is this related

543
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to the interrelationship

544
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
between species?

545
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Can the organism

546
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
create or develop

547
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
its own niche,

548
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
its own ecological position,

549
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
its own opportunity

550
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
to reproduce more

551
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
or to diversify?

552
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This is the content of the evolution of biology.

553
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm using

554
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
a framework

555
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
called CTPE,

556
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.

557
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In Chinese, it stands for

558
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.

559
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is actually

560
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
a more comprehensive discipline.

561
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It requires knowledge

562
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
other than the traditional

563
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
community ecology.

564
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It also requires the concept of

565
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
evolution of biology

566
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
or system development of biology.

567
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How does it study?

568
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Assuming that

569
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
you can see the composition

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
of different species

571
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
on an environmental scale.

572
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You will see

573
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
certain characteristics

574
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
of these species

575
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
in observation,

576
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
so you can

577
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
divide them into different species.

578
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We will infer

579
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
the characteristics of

580
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
these species,

581
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and assess

582
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
what happened to them.

583
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Are there any processes

584
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that lead to

585
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the results you see now?

586
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What are these processes?

587
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There is a book in 2016

588
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
written by

589
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Mark Barron.

590
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It is about the theory of

591
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ecological communities.

592
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
In this theory,

593
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
he tells us that

594
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the structure of the community

595
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is made up of

596
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
four main processes.

597
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The first process

598
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
is the selection process.

599
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It is also called

600
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the filtering process.

601
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The second process is

602
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the drift process.

603
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is a random process

604
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
that affects

605
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
a small group of species.

606
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The third process is

607
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the dispersion process.

608
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The reason why the species

609
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
are divided into four

610
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
processes is because

611
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
the species are

612
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
divided into three

613
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
processes.

614
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The fourth process is

615
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the seeding process.

616
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In my view,

617
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
a group of species

618
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
is mainly affected

619
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
by these four processes.

620
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It is not what you see now.

621
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The ecological processes

622
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
you see now

623
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
are the results of

624
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the filtering process.

625
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If you see that

626
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the shape of a group of species

627
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is very different,

628
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
it is the result of

629
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the dispersion process.

630
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It sounds logical,

631
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
so it can be done.

632
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let's take a look at

633
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the results of my

634
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
previous research

635
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
on land animals.

636
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The filtering process

637
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
plays a role in

638
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the group of species we study.

639
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Here are two examples.

640
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
One is a worm,

641
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and the other is an ant in a jar.

642
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is a study

643
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
we did in Changbai Mountain,

644
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Northeastern China.

645
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We surveyed

646
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
the growth of

647
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
a species in a group of worms

648
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
along 10 different heights.

649
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
We looked at the shape of

650
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
its body,

651
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and the proportion of

652
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the dark and light colors

653
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
in the group.

654
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We found that

655
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
the higher the height,

656
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the lower the amount

657
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
of egg in the soil.

658
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The higher the height,

659
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
the lower the amount

660
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
of egg in the soil,

661
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and the darker the color

662
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
in the worm group.

663
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The color of the body

664
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is an important shape

665
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
of the worm.

666
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This is the reason

667
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
why the color of the worm

668
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
is different.

669
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Another example is

670
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
a project I'm doing

671
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
in the tourism area

672
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
in Indonesia.

673
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is a project

674
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
we did two or three years ago.

675
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We surveyed ants in jars

676
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and collected them

677
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
in a sprayer.

678
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We looked at the characteristics

679
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
of ants in jars

680
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and collected them

681
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
in a sprayer.

682
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We found that

683
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
in four different environments,

684
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
such as tropical rainforests,

685
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
rainforests,

686
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
rubber fields,

687
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
rubber fields,

688
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and zoological gardens,

689
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
the characteristics of ants

690
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
in jars

691
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and their

692
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
habitat patterns

693
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
were selected by the environment.

694
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
This is the pattern.

695
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How did the environment come about?

696
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The degree of degradation of the environment

697
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
was caused by man-made development

698
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and the way the land was used.

699
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
As a result,

700
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
these special-shaped ants

701
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
were selected.

702
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You can see the shape

703
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
of these species.

704
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
In addition to the color of the body,

705
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
what else can you see?

706
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The size of the body

707
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and the shape of the body.

708
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
To put it simply,

709
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
we can divide the shape

710
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
into two different categories.

711
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
One is called Beta-nitrate

712
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and the other is called Alpha-nitrate.

713
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Beta-nitrate refers to those

714
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that are related to the environment,

715
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
such as the durability of the environment,

716
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
such as the color of the body.

717
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You can think of it

718
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
as a Beta-nitrate.

719
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
In addition,

720
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the shape of Alpha-nitrate

721
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
is related to the way

722
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the ants feed.

723
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
This is related to the way

724
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
they use resources.

725
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you observe the shape

726
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
of a species in a group,

727
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
there may be similarities

728
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and there may not be similarities.

729
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You can see that

730
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
there are three groups

731
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
in the three boxes on the right.

732
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Take a closer look

733
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
at which ones are similar

734
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and which ones are not.

735
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The shape of the three ants

736
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
in the three boxes on the right

737
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
is the same,

738
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but the color is different.

739
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Take a closer look

740
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
at the size of the body.

741
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The size of the three ants

742
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
in the three boxes on the right

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
is the same,

744
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
but the color is different.

745
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You can see that

746
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
if you observe its shape,

747
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you can deduce that

748
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
in addition to filtering,

749
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Alpha-nitrate is similar

750
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
in the same group.

751
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
For Alpha-nitrate,

752
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the Alpha-nitrate difference

753
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
is relatively large

754
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
in the same group.

755
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The pigmentation

756
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that I just mentioned

757
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
is the body color change

758
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
of the insects along the height.

759
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This shows

760
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
that the body color

761
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
is a beta-nitrate

762
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and the alpha-nitrate

763
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
can help the insects

764
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
live on higher altitudes.

765
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What is Alpha-nitrate?

766
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It is related to food resources.

767
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
How do we study

768
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
food resources in soil animals?

769
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What do they eat?

770
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
In the early days,

771
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
they simply put an insect

772
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
under a microscope

773
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
to see what contents

774
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
are in its intestine.

775
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This technology is very good

776
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
in the study of

777
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
soil particles.

778
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
In the early days,

779
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
after 50 years,

780
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
what new methods do we have?

781
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
In the lower left corner,

782
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
you can see a

783
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Trophy Image Parameter.

784
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is another study.

785
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This is the practicality of

786
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
making insects.

787
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We have chosen four

788
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
more common methods

789
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
to study different

790
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
insects by

791
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
using different methods.

792
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The first method

793
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
is the method of stable isotopes.

794
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This method can help us

795
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
know what is the feed

796
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
of a species in the soil food network.

797
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Is it a feeder or

798
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
a first class separator or a feeder?

799
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This is known by

800
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
stable isotopes of

801
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
alpha-nitrate.

802
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We can also know

803
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
what is the source of

804
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the feed of

805
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
a species in the soil.

806
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Is it directly

807
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
eaten by plants

808
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
or those that have been

809
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
sterilized by bacteria?

810
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
This is a long-term

811
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
accumulation process.

812
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It takes a long time

813
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to see the change

814
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
in stable isotopes.

815
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Compared with this,

816
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
neutral epiphytase,

817
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
neutral fatty acid,

818
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
can help us know

819
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
what is the feed of

820
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
a species in the soil.

821
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
For example,

822
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
this metabolism is

823
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
shorter than that of

824
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the same species.

825
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So we can know

826
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
what is the feed of

827
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
a species in the soil

828
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
for several weeks

829
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to several months.

830
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The second method

831
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is digestive enzyme.

832
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
These two methods

833
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
have been used for a long time,

834
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but they are still very useful.

835
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Digestive enzymes,

836
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
such as fiber,

837
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and cytosine,

838
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
can help us know

839
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
what is the feed of

840
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
a species in the soil.

841
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Is it fiber or bacteria?

842
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Bacteria have cytosine.

843
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Finally,

844
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
we need to decrypt

845
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
an animal to see

846
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
what is the feed of

847
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
a species in the soil.

848
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We found that

849
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
these four methods

850
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
are not related to each other.

851
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It is difficult for us

852
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
to use one method

853
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to decrypt

854
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
the other three methods.

855
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The analysis results

856
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
show that

857
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the four methods are

858
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
equally important.

859
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They reflect the

860
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
different aspects of

861
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the whole process

862
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
from swallowing,

863
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
digesting,

864
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
absorbing,

865
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
chronicling,

866
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to its body tissue.

867
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So,

868
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
you can see

869
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
how complicated

870
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
this thing is.

871
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In addition to the shape of

872
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the shape of the

873
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
shape of the

874
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and other

875
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
more abstract

876
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
aspects,

877
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we also have

878
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
studied

879
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
that

880
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
many Species

881
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
are

882
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
more exemplary

883
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
than other

884
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
forms of

885
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
life.

886
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The original

887
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
species,

888
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
there are seven

889
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
different species.

890
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's see

891
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
if the gene

892
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and the bacterium

893
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
are the same

894
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
number

895
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
or not.

896
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We found

897
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that the gene

898
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and the bacterium

899
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
are the same number.

900
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Next,

901
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
we study

902
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the larvae.

903
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We study

904
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the bacteria

905
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
related to the larvae

906
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and the same number

907
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
of the larvae.

908
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Are they related?

909
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think

910
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it's interesting

911
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that the larvae

912
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
are not only the native species,

913
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
but also the species

914
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
living on the snow.

915
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's see what the larvae

916
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
eat on the snow.

917
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
In winter,

918
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
or in summer,

919
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
there is no snow in summer,

920
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and there is snow in winter.

921
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Let's see

922
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
if the larvae

923
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
will eat

924
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
under the snow

925
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
or on the snow.

926
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There are

927
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
three different larvae.

928
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We found that

929
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
there are two species

930
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
living on the snow.

931
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Their same number

932
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and long life

933
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
show that their food

934
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
comes from snow,

935
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
not from soil.

936
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Another species

937
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
grows between

938
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
snow and

939
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
fallen leaves.

940
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Its same number

941
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and bacteria

942
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I like this research

943
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
because it uses

944
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
two different methods

945
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
to answer

946
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
an interesting question.

947
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What do the larvae eat

948
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
on the snow?

949
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's not the same as

950
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
what we usually know.

951
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So,

952
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
we used the shape

953
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to see the similarity

954
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
of the shape

955
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
or the relationship

956
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
between the shape

957
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and the larvae.

958
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
What is the ecological process?

959
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Is it the filtration process

960
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
or the division process

961
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
that affects

962
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
the group formation of

963
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the larvae?

964
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Next,

965
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
we will talk about

966
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
the evolution

967
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
of the shape

968
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and the formation

969
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
of the species.

970
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
This is the multidimensional shape.

971
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
When you put different species

972
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
on an evolution relationship tree,

973
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
such as the system of evolution

974
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
or the evolution tree,

975
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
what will you see?

976
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You will see these three species,

977
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
these three round species,

978
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
like the mouse species,

979
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
come from the same evolution value.

980
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So, here you will see

981
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
a system of evolution.

982
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
On the shape,

983
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
you will see a system of evolution.

984
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Another situation is

985
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
that you see these three green larvae.

986
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Although they are all green,

987
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
they come from different evolution values.

988
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
These three round larvae

989
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
come from the same evolution value.

990
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
These three green larvae

991
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
come from different evolution values.

992
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This is the difference.

993
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Do they come from the same evolution value?

994
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The more similar species are,

995
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
the more similar they are

996
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
on the shape.

997
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So,

998
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we use the relationship

999
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
between species.

1000
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This relationship may be determined

1001
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
by the DNA sequence

1002
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and compared.

1003
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We look at the difference

1004
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
in the DNA sequence.

1005
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Is the difference in the relationship

1006
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
related to the shape of the species?

1007
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Then we can

1008
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
understand the evolution process.

1009
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What I just said is

1010
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
similar species

1011
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
should be said

1012
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to be similar species.

1013
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The shape of

1014
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
similar species is generally similar.

1015
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
This is a necessary result.

1016
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
We call such a phenomenon

1017
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
a system of evolution

1018
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
with a system of evolution.

1019
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The nature of the

1020
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
jump worm

1021
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
is composed of

1022
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
neutral fatty acids.

1023
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Neutral fatty acids allow us to know

1024
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
whether the source of food

1025
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
is mainly bacteria or plants.

1026
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Neutral fatty acids

1027
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
also allow us to know

1028
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
how the jump worm adapts to temperature.

1029
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We find that

1030
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
most of the neutral fatty acids

1031
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
related to physiological

1032
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and temperature adaptation

1033
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
show a system of evolution.

1034
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
However, those fatty acids

1035
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
related to food resources

1036
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
do not show a system of evolution.

1037
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What I just said is

1038
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
the growth of

1039
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
germin.

1040
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The growth of germin

1041
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
is related to

1042
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the stable number of germin.

1043
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The growth of germin

1044
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
is related to the source of food.

1045
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
In contrast,

1046
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
the relationship between

1047
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
germin bacteria and the number of germin

1048
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
is not so strong.

1049
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Instead, it is related to

1050
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the system of evolution of germin.

1051
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What does this show?

1052
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It shows that these bacteria

1053
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
may be a symbiotic bacteria for germin.

1054
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The relationship between germin and germin

1055
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
is relatively close.

1056
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Germin may be a food,

1057
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
so it is the same number as germin.

1058
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The number of germin reflects

1059
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the position of germin in the food network.

1060
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Therefore, these bacteria

1061
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
can be a food

1062
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and the number of germin

1063
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
can reflect the food network.

1064
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So this thing can be linked together.

1065
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What else does the evolution of germin

1066
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
have in common?

1067
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We asked the question

1068
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
how do these species come from?

1069
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You can put these species

1070
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
together as a database.

1071
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
These species in the group

1072
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
are actually a part

1073
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
of a large database.

1074
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
A subset.

1075
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
These species

1076
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
have a database first,

1077
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and then they are selected

1078
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
or divided into different groups.

1079
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What is the evolution process?

1080
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We asked

1081
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
how this database was formed.

1082
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
On a historical context,

1083
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
from ancient to modern,

1084
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
how do these shapes change?

1085
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
How are these species formed?

1086
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
There are two hypotheses.

1087
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You can imagine

1088
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that I just introduced

1089
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
a vertical natural belt

1090
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
at Changbai Mountain in the northeast.

1091
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The height of the peak.

1092
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Do these jump worms

1093
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
evolve at high altitude first?

1094
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Or do they evolve separately

1095
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and then expand?

1096
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What you see now

1097
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
are three arrows in the middle.

1098
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The three arrows point to the group.

1099
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Among the groups,

1100
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
these three species

1101
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
all come from the same evolution.

1102
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So it is possible that

1103
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
there is a group first,

1104
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
this is the base,

1105
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and then the process of germination

1106
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
occurs in it.

1107
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So this germination speciation

1108
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
is a relatively recent process.

1109
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That is to say,

1110
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it is possible that

1111
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
there are three species

1112
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and then the species changes.

1113
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Compared to this,

1114
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you can see that

1115
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
it is the same as this green frame.

1116
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This frame is a specific evolution.

1117
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But the three green jump worms

1118
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
in this frame

1119
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
come from different evolution.

1120
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It is possible that

1121
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
these three jump worms

1122
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
are formed first

1123
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and then some ecological effects

1124
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
occur in this frame.

1125
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So there are jump worms first

1126
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and then ecological effects.

1127
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So it is called oligopersistence.

1128
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The one in front is speciation,

1129
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
recent speciation,

1130
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the most recent evolution.

1131
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The one behind is

1132
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
a relatively old group,

1133
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
a relatively old species,

1134
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
they spread and gather together.

1135
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So on a high altitude or

1136
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
at an altitude of a mountain range,

1137
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is the jump worm first

1138
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
or is it formed

1139
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
at different altitudes?

1140
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
These are two studies

1141
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in my previous research

1142
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
that are more representative

1143
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
of the formation of jump worms

1144
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and the evolution of jump worms.

1145
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The question is

1146
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
how these jump worms are formed.

1147
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This study is a wide-spread

1148
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
jump worm

1149
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that we have investigated

1150
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and it is actually

1151
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
a wide-spread jump worm.

1152
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We think it has only one form.

1153
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So we can only identify it

1154
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
as this kind,

1155
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Leptosuchus longinus.

1156
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But we use DNA

1157
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
to compare its sequence.

1158
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We found that

1159
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
there are not only one type

1160
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
in GÃ¶ttingen andå¨é­.

1161
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
In fact, there are three different types.

1162
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We call them lineages

1163
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
because we are not sure

1164
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
how far the relationship between them is.

1165
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How far is it?

1166
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It is so far that they have separated

1167
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
when they were in Myosin.

1168
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
This is a process of millions of years.

1169
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So we think

1170
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
it may not be

1171
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
the same species.

1172
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We also found

1173
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
an interesting phenomenon.

1174
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
These three different lineages

1175
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
mean that

1176
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
they prefer different

1177
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
genotypes.

1178
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The first lineage

1179
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
prefers farmland,

1180
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the second prefers forest,

1181
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and the third prefers grassland.

1182
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It seems that environmental filtering

1183
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
plays a certain role here.

1184
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Environment makes

1185
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
these jump worms

1186
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
have some DNA division.

1187
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But we know little about it.

1188
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We do not know

1189
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
what shape can

1190
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
reflect these divisions.

1191
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We only know that its form is the same,

1192
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
or it is different.

1193
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
French tells us

1194
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
that these three lineages can only

1195
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
separate two lineages.

1196
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The two lineages 2 and 3

1197
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
cannot be separated at all.

1198
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What is the difference between 1 and the other two?

1199
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The only difference is

1200
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the ratio of the difference

1201
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
between the two hairs on the side.

1202
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So the color, body size,

1203
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
or scale distribution

1204
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
are not known.

1205
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We can't find one

1206
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
to explain the difference

1207
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
or the reason why

1208
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
they prefer different genotypes.

1209
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But we know that

1210
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
genotypes have an impact on

1211
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the DNA division of jump worms.

1212
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Let's go back to the research

1213
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
in Changbai Mountain, northeast China.

1214
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
In this research,

1215
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
we found more than 20 types of

1216
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
jump worms.

1217
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We want to explore

1218
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
what causes

1219
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
more than 20 types of jump worms,

1220
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
not only 5 or 10.

1221
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Are these jump worms

1222
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
related to

1223
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the evolution of

1224
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
the environment

1225
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
in ancient times

1226
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
or now?

1227
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
According to some statistics,

1228
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
we know that

1229
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
these jump worms

1230
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
may be related to

1231
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
the pH of soil

1232
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and the type of rock.

1233
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
When did Changbai Mountain

1234
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
form?

1235
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Changbai Mountain is the

1236
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
red star

1237
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
and the dotted line.

1238
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
After the dotted line,

1239
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Changbai Mountain

1240
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
was formed.

1241
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But these jump worms

1242
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
have already been

1243
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
divided into different types

1244
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
before they formed.

1245
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Obviously,

1246
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
these jump worms

1247
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
are related to

1248
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the evolution of

1249
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the environment

1250
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
in ancient times.

1251
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Therefore,

1252
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
the evolution of

1253
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
3D organisms,

1254
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
3D soil organisms,

1255
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and 3D jump worms

1256
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
is not a major factor

1257
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
in the evolution of

1258
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
3D organisms.

1259
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
In fact,

1260
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
the evolution of

1261
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
3D organisms

1262
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
can explain

1263
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
the existence of

1264
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
3D soil organisms

1265
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
in ancient times.

1266
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
OK.

1267
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
We still have some time.

1268
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Next time,

1269
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
when you observe

1270
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
these soil organisms

1271
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
with some special means,

1272
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
we can think about

1273
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
what caused

1274
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
these

1275
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
colorful soil organisms

1276
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
to eat different foods

1277
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and live in

1278
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
different environments.

1279
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
After 50 years,

1280
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
it seems that we have

1281
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
a new understanding of these soil organisms.

1282
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So,

1283
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
this is the method

1284
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I use for my research.

1285
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
In general,

1286
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
when we do ecological research,

1287
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
we look at the environment

1288
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
in which these soil organisms

1289
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
grow.

1290
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In the study of soil,

1291
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
we generally measure

1292
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the amount of water in the soil,

1293
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the pH value of the soil,

1294
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and the amount of carbon in the soil.

1295
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
We also do some measurements

1296
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of microorganisms,

1297
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
such as the amount of microorganisms,

1298
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
the speed of microorganisms' breathing,

1299
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and the composition of microorganisms.

1300
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
These are environmental variables

1301
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
that affect the environment

1302
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
they grow in,

1303
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
including their food resources,

1304
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
some of their physical and chemical

1305
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
non-living factors.

1306
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
In this environment,

1307
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
we will identify

1308
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
which species they belong to.

1309
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The composition of these species,

1310
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
the composition of all individuals,

1311
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is called a group.

1312
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So, we will get

1313
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
a group of data

1314
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
about the soil organisms themselves.

1315
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
During the identification process,

1316
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
we will look at the shape of their bodies.

1317
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
They look different.

1318
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
We can classify them into different species.

1319
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But we also have to think about

1320
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
whether they have the same food resources.

1321
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So, we have to know

1322
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
what kind of food they eat.

1323
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This part of the data

1324
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
is called the shape of the data.

1325
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Finally, we can draw DNA

1326
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
from these species.

1327
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then, we will make a series of DNA

1328
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
to make their cyanobacteria.

1329
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Based on these cyanobacteria,

1330
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
we can deduce

1331
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
the evolution process

1332
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
or the evolution pattern

1333
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
in the past.

1334
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
This can tell us

1335
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
the system development of these species.

1336
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It can also tell us

1337
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
the formation of the species

1338
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and its shape.

1339
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So, this DNA series

1340
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
can be called

1341
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
the fourth type of data.

1342
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I just said

1343
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
that I am a data analyst.

1344
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I specialize in data analysis.

1345
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So, most of my work

1346
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
is to analyze these four types of data

1347
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
to see their relationship

1348
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
or the difference between them.

1349
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Based on this analysis,

1350
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
we can answer

1351
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
which ecological processes

1352
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
are filtered,

1353
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
divided,

1354
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
or dispersed

1355
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
to affect the biodiversity

1356
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
of these species.

1357
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We can also find out

1358
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
why these species exist.

1359
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Let me summarize.

1360
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Filtering and

1361
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
dividing are

1362
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
the two main processes

1363
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in Markvillain's

1364
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
selection process

1365
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and the ecological process.

1366
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So far,

1367
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
these two processes,

1368
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
especially the filtering process,

1369
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
show the shape of

1370
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
the body color.

1371
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
If we want to know

1372
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
the process of diversification,

1373
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
we may need to use

1374
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
some shapes related to food resources.

1375
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
This must be achieved

1376
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
by using stable isotopes,

1377
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
neutral fatty acids,

1378
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
enzymes, and long-distance microorganisms.

1379
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
These four different ways

1380
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
to study

1381
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
the food resources

1382
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
can help us

1383
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
better understand

1384
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
their food sources

1385
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and food faces.

1386
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
This includes

1387
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
swallowing, digesting,

1388
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
absorbing, and digesting.

1389
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The whole process

1390
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
of

1391
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
getting nutrients.

1392
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
In addition,

1393
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
regarding the evolution process,

1394
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
we found that most of the shape

1395
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
is systemically developed.

1396
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
That is to say,

1397
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
the more similar species

1398
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
are more similar

1399
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
in shape.

1400
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
However,

1401
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
their food sources

1402
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
are different.

1403
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What did I just say?

1404
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The more similar species

1405
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
are more similar

1406
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
in shape.

1407
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But the food they eat

1408
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
may be different.

1409
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The more similar species

1410
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
are more similar

1411
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
in shape.

1412
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
In the 3D system,

1413
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
we know that

1414
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
3D soil organisms

1415
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
do not evolve

1416
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
from high altitudes.

1417
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Instead,

1418
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the current evidence shows

1419
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
that they come from

1420
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
several older species.

1421
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Then,

1422
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
through some ecological processes,

1423
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
or environmental filtering,

1424
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
they can gather together.

1425
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Next time,

1426
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
when you walk into a forest,

1427
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you might as well

1428
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
take a look at the soil

1429
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and see if there are any animals.

1430
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Try to find

1431
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
these cute little animals.

1432
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
That's my report.

1433
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Thank you very much

1434
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
for giving me this opportunity

1435
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
to talk about my research.

1436
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I also want to thank

1437
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
everyone who has supported me

1438
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
in the past,

1439
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
including my teachers,

1440
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
colleagues, friends,

1441
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and assistants in the lab.

1442
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
That's all for my report.

1443
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'll stop sharing now.

1444
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I didn't expect

1445
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that there are

1446
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
16 people in the audience

1447
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
who don't know me.

1448
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Thank you.

1449
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Do you have

1450
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
any questions?

1451
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
If you don't want

1452
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
to turn on the microphone,

1453
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
you can type your questions

1454
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
in the chat.

1455
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I'll help you ask.

1456
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No one has

1457
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
any questions,

1458
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
so I'll ask first.

1459
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Ding Wenxiang,

1460
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
you mentioned that

1461
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
the amount of carbon dioxide

1462
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
is related to the altitude

1463
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and that the altitude

1464
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
is related to the body color.

1465
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Are you implying

1466
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
that the body color

1467
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

1468
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
are related?

1469
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
What you showed

1470
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
on the chart

1471
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
is that the amount of carbon dioxide

1472
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
is related to the body color

1473
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and that the body color

1474
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

1475
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
are related.

1476
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Logically,

1477
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
we can understand that

1478
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
the body color

1479
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

1480
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
are related.

1481
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But the data

1482
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
show that

1483
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the body color

1484
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

1485
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
are not related.

1486
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I can't find

1487
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
the same altitude

1488
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
with different body color

1489
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and see the difference

1490
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
in the amount of carbon dioxide.

1491
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Do you have similar data?

1492
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
In theory,

1493
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
the number of

1494
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
insects

1495
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
in the same altitude

1496
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
should be quite common.

1497
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So in theory,

1498
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
you should be able to find

1499
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
the same altitude

1500
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
with different amount of carbon dioxide

1501
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But this is

1502
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
a bit strange.

1503
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Why is the amount of carbon dioxide

1504
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
related to the body color?

1505
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This is an interesting point.

1506
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You just said

1507
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
that we can find

1508
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
different points

1509
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
on the same altitude

1510
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and see if the amount of carbon dioxide

1511
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
will affect the body color.

1512
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I can say that

1513
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
it should not affect the body color.

1514
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Of course,

1515
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
from a mechanical point of view,

1516
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it is difficult to find

1517
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
a mechanism

1518
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
to explain

1519
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
why the amount of carbon dioxide

1520
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
will affect the body color.

1521
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
As I said,

1522
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
the UV ray

1523
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
may be harmful to the animal.

1524
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So it must have a deeper body color

1525
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
to resist or protect it

1526
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
from such strong UV rays.

1527
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It may be easier to say this.

1528
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But you remind me of a point.

1529
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In fact, when we were doing the research,

1530
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
we measured

1531
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
three points on this altitude.

1532
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
No,

1533
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
we measured five points.

1534
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
These five points

1535
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
were finally analyzed

1536
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
as a random factor.

1537
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So we don't really care

1538
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
about the difference

1539
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
between the five points

1540
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
on the same altitude.

1541
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Our question is

1542
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the difference between different altitudes.

1543
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Whether it is the difference

1544
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
between the altitude

1545
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

1546
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
in the soil,

1547
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
we want to find

1548
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
the one that can best explain

1549
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the body color distribution

1550
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
of this group

1551
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
in statistics.

1552
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
In statistics,

1553
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
but you will find

1554
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
that it is more difficult

1555
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
to understand.

1556
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So your data

1557
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
is still taken by you,

1558
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
instead of doing

1559
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
a meta-data analysis.

1560
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Most of what I just said

1561
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
is my own actual research

1562
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and data.

1563
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The real meta-analysis

1564
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
is the relationship

1565
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
between the four methods

1566
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
of soil erosion.

1567
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That is the meta-analysis.

1568
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
We still like to go out in the wild

1569
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and actually measure the material

1570
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
to see what the animals look like.

1571
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I prefer to sit in front of the computer

1572
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and analyze the data.

1573
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I need my colleagues

1574
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
and friends

1575
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
to provide the first-hand data.

1576
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Then we have the opportunity

1577
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
to reuse their data

1578
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and ask different scientific questions.

1579
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So I really appreciate

1580
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and cherish their contribution

1581
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
to soil biology.

1582
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Of course, everyone

1583
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
has to find their own niche

1584
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
and partition

1585
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
in order to

1586
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
find what they like

1587
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and share the knowledge

1588
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
with their colleagues.

1589
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Some of my colleagues

1590
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
are very good at

1591
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
soil biology,

1592
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and they are also

1593
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
very good at

1594
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
identification biology.

1595
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
In this respect,

1596
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
we are just a

1597
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
complementary role.

1598
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Do you have any questions?

1599
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I don't want to be recorded.
