00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome everyone to the Terra Talk on August 6th.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Dr. Chen Tai-Yan currently teaches at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
She graduated from the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University and the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Her Ph.D. was in Texas A&M.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
She did her Ph.D. in agricultural engineering.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
After her Ph.D., she moved to Cornell.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Her field of research is mostly...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Did I say it right?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I saw Dr. Tai-Yan laughing.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Her field of research is mostly single-molecule super-resolution microscopy.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Her research system is mostly biophysics.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Dr. Tai-Yan is a very good teacher.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
She has given lectures in different fields and topics at Terra.

01:07.000 --> 01:18.000
Today, she will be talking about...

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
As a senior Ph.D. student,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
when your Ph.D. is in its second or third year,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
you have gone through a lot.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
When you think about your next phase,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
you have to prepare yourself.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You have to ask yourself some good questions.

01:33.000 --> 01:46.000
This will allow you to move on to the next phase more smoothly.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
Let's welcome Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you, Dr. Tai-Yan.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
I am very happy to be able to participate in Project Terra's talk today.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
First of all, thanks for the kind invitation.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
This talk is more informal.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
If you have any questions,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
you can ask them in the middle of my talk.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
I hope you can learn a lot from today's talk.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
This is a topic we talked about in the beginning of Project Terra.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
How to have a successful Ph.D. career for senior Ph.D. students.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
I was surprised when I first saw this title.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
It uses a very special word,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
which is successful Ph.D. career.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
It is very difficult to define a successful Ph.D. career.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
I personally feel that every student has a different background.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Everyone has a different Ph.D. career,

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
so there is no specific formula for everyone.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
What I am doing today is to share my personal experience

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
and tell you what you can do to have a positive impact on your future development.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Everyone has a different background,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
so you can try it if it suits you.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
I hope these tips can help you to have a better Ph.D. career.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Let me briefly introduce my personal experience.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
My experience is not ordinary.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I am a slow learner in every process.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I think it is related to my personality.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I am a gentle person.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
You can see that I started my Ph.D. degree in 2018.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I graduated from my senior year in 2004.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I worked as a research assistant for a year and went abroad in 2005.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Before that, I was a chemistry major,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
specifically a material scientist.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
My main job was to synthesize some materials

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
and make some luminous materials.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I was focused on synthesis.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
When I finished my Ph.D. degree,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
my boss asked me if I wanted to study for a Ph.D. degree.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
I looked back at my classmates in the Ph.D. class.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I found that everyone was doing the same thing.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I found that everyone was doing the same thing.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
My boss told me to study for a Ph.D. degree,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
or else I would have to work in the industry.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
At that time, I didn't have any prior knowledge.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
I was a country boy from Hualien.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
After studying at Tsingtao University for a few years,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I never thought about going abroad.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It wasn't until my boss mentioned this to me

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
that I seriously thought about going abroad.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
I was lucky enough to apply for A&M.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Since then, I have been living in the U.S. for 17 years.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
When I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I decided to change my field.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I thought synthesis was fun,

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
but I felt like I was in a bottleneck.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I thought I understood how to do synthesis,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
but I didn't know if I did a good job.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
I didn't know how to determine the efficiency of synthesis.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
I started to feel like we didn't discuss it in detail.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
When doing synthesis,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
we just guessed how to make it more efficient.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
We didn't have a more fundamental understanding.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I decided to change my field.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
I wanted to know more about the physics of these materials.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
At that time, Neoparticle was very popular.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
So I joined a lab that specializes in Neoparticle

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
and does a lot of electronic, light, magnetic analysis.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So I spent five and a half years doing this.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
During that time,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I learned how to add a device,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
how to analyze,

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
and how to understand the advantages and disadvantages of a material

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
from a very fundamental perspective.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
After that,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I started to think that

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I already had an intention that I wanted to be a teacher.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
When I started to study for my Ph.D. degree,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
my first goal was that I wanted to go back to Taiwan to be a professor.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
But then I met a lot of different people.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
So in the end, I ended up being a teacher in the U.S.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Later, you can see that

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
from Maths to Ph.D.,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
it's a bit like turning a corner.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
You start to do very materialized things.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But I think the biggest turning point in my life

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
was when I was studying for my postdoc.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Before that,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I didn't have any background in biology.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
But when I was studying for my postdoc,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I did a 90-degree turn.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
I spent five and a half years doing postdocs.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
At that time,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
I started to learn about monochromatic biology.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
The main reason was that

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I met my wife.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
My wife is a neon biologist.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I thought,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
okay,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
we can do some research together in the future.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Let's learn something new.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
But I didn't expect that

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
learning something new would take me five and a half years.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
So I spent five and a half years in Cornell.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I was hired to Cornell

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
mainly because I knew how to drive a car.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
So when I got there,

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
my main job was to build up a super-low-energy microscope,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
and create software to analyze images.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That was my main job,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
building instruments and analyzing things.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
That was my main job.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But when I joined a new element,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
my career took a big turn.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Later on,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
you can see that my current research program

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
started to connect with neural cells.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
This process is very interesting.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
If you have good support,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
this is a very enjoyable process.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
But it's not a typical process.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
I don't recommend everyone to try this mode.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
This mode has its advantages,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
but I think the difficulties in the middle are quite high.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
If you are interested,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
we can talk about this later.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
The main reason why I mentioned this is because

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
you can see that

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I made a lot of changes in the direction of the pressure.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
In the process of these changes,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
I think there is one thing I often do.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I like to chat with my friends,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
or I like to chat with my junior in the lab.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
In the process of chatting,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
the most frequently asked question is,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
okay,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
the most frequently asked question is,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
okay,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
When you study for a PhD,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
what is the biggest challenge you face?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I've been asking this question for 17 years.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
So I think,

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
in these processes,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
you can know what everyone thinks about PhDs.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
After hearing a lot of people's opinions,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I started to have some questions about

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
what PhDs are all about.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Last week,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
last week or the week before last,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
last week,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Project Tara invited Bo-Jun to share with you

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
what he thinks about PhDs.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
He also provided a lot of very useful advice.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Here are some of the things he provided.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
For example,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
What do you want to do?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
How to find advice?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Some general advice.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I think they're all very, very good.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
What I'm going to do today,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I still want to address

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
why I want to study for a PhD.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Okay.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
In my personal opinion,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
this is the most important of all.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
If you clearly know

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
why you want to study for a PhD,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I think when you encounter a lot of difficulties,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
it will be much better to adjust your mindset.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Okay.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
When people ask you,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
why do you want to study for a PhD?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I think the question you need to reflect on is,

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
what is the meaning of a PhD to me?

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
I used to hear a lot of answers.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
If you have a PhD,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
don't say you can independently solve problems.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
You can actually create,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
find new knowledge by yourself.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I think these are all very good answers.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
it's my own feeling.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It's my own feeling.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I think a PhD is actually a lifestyle.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
So far,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
my personal understanding is that

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
we were born until you grew up.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
We've been trying to understand

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
how the world works.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
It depends on your professional training.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Okay.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
People, things, and objects

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
will make you

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
a little bit twisted

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
about how the world works.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Everyone knows that

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
these may be the same.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Okay.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
But those little things

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
will basically become the tipping point

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
for you to make a decision.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Okay.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
So I think

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
if you study for a PhD,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
the biggest advantage is

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
that it is an excellent training platform.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Okay.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So when you encounter a problem,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
you know how to analyze the problem,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
how to define the problem,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
and how to solve the problem.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Then you can explain to others

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
that I encountered this problem,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
and what I think it should be like.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
When it's like this,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I think it should have some impact.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Okay.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
These things are actually

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
when you do experiments,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
when you do research,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
I think there is a very, very big overlap.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Okay.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
To a certain extent,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I think if you can imagine

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
a PhD as

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
your last training stage,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
then I think

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
if you can learn

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
its essence,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I think it will be a very helpful process

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
for your life.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Okay.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Like I just said,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
okay,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
let's make a comparison.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
When you encounter a problem,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
okay,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
the first thing is

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
you have to understand

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
what the problem is.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Right?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Then this is the same as

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
when you do academic research,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
okay,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
you do a lot of literature research,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
it's actually the same.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Okay.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
At first,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
when you come up with a phenomenon,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
you don't know what happened.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
What you can do is

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
okay,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm going to look for more documents

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
to give me a better understanding

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
of this system.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Okay.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
In this case,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
you can start to define your problem.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
In other words,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
you can start to formulate your hypothesis.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Okay.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
After that,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
once you have a hypothesis,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
you can do the experiment.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Then after the experiment,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
you might say,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
okay,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
in the end,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
okay,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
you might fail many times in the middle,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
but in the end,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
most likely,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
you can actually figure out something new.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Right?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Now,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
after this is over,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
one very important thing,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
one very important training

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
in Ph.D. is

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
okay,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
you need to actually

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
present your results.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Okay.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Tell people why this is actually important.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Okay.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Then this thing

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
will be in your training,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
in your presentation training,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
to get a

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
proper

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
preparation.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Okay.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
So, in my opinion,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I think the biggest advantage of Ph.D. is that

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
you learn a more systematic

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
method

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
to deal with

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
the problems in your life.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Okay.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
This is a relatively broad statement.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
But I think

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
you project

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
what you learn in Ph.D.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
into your life experience.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I think this is the most

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
meaningful thing.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Okay.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
So, this is

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
how I view the Ph.D.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So, I think

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
what everyone does may not be the same.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Okay.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
But the underlying principle

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
and how you deal with things in your life

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I think this really provides a

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
very, very good training place.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
So,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
how do you define

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
whether your Ph.D. is successful or not?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I think

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
the easiest parameter is

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
whether you enjoy the process.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
If you can enjoy

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
the process,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
and you can

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
make the things on the slide

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
to an extreme,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I think it's a very successful

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Ph.D. career.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Because the things you need

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
can follow you for a lifetime.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think this is more important

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
than anything else.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Okay.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Of course,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
some people do better,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
some people do worse.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
But so what?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Okay.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Paper is paper, right?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
You can create new knowledge,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
but it's not going to go with you forever.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Right?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
You have to face new problems every day.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Knowing how to handle these problems

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
is more important,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
I think.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Okay, get back to this.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I think

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
the timeline is important.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
When you're doing your Ph.D.,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
there's a timeline

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
in your mind.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
I think this is

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
a very, very important thing.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Okay.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I've highlighted some

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
more important

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
milestones

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
for your Ph.D.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
In the first year,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
when you first came in,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
get used to the environment,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
finish the course as soon as possible.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
In the second year,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
you'll start to have

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
the so-called

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Qualified Exam.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Okay.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
After the Qualified Exam,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
you'll become

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
the so-called Ph.D. candidate.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
You're no longer

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
just a student.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Okay.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
You're not a graduate student.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You're a Ph.D. candidate.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Okay.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Then you start to propose

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
what you want to do.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Then

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
work very hard,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
publish some papers.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
In the end,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
this is

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
okay,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
pass your dissertation.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Then eventually,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
do your defense.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Then eventually,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
get your Ph.D.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Okay.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
So it's a very, very

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
general process.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
This process

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
usually takes you

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
four to five years,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
depending on

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
your research field.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Okay.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
But I think

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
five years

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
has become

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
a more and more

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
common timeline.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yes.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Of course,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I guess engineers

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
may be faster.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
But I think

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
five years at the Institute of Technology

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
seems to be more and more common.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
The good thing is

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I think I've seen

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
more and more colleges

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
recently

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
put

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
some teachers

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
will let students

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
stay for six or seven years.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
This kind of thing

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
they do have

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
put in effort

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
to minimize

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
these things

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
happen.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Okay.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
So

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
but I guess

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
in general,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
it should be

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
about five years

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
will be a reasonable timeline.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Okay.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
In these five years,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I think

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
it can be divided

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
into two stages.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Okay.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
The first stage

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I call

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
training phase.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Okay.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
The second one

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
is actually

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
networking phase.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Okay.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Training phase

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
is usually

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
if everything is ideal,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I think

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
the better time

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
is in the first three years

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
to put

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
the training

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Okay.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
The skill set

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
should have

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
should have

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
knowledge

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
in the first three years

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
should be

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
almost the same.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Okay.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
The fourth and fifth years

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
should be

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
focused on

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
networking

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
things.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Okay.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Networking

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I said networking

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
is like

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
going to a conference

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
or

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
dealing with people

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
you don't know.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Okay.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Start reaching out

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
to the company.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Okay.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
The so-called

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
networking phase.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Okay.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
A lot of people

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
squeeze this

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
networking phase

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
to the last

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
semester.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
My personal feeling

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
that it's too late.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Okay.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
So I think

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
having this

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
timeline

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
is important

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
in my heart.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Okay.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Let's talk

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
about

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
more

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
more

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
simple

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
more fundamental

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
things

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
like

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
how to

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
do things

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
on the food.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I think

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
you can try

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
to make

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
the training phase

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
more smooth.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Okay.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
In the training phase

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
I think

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
there are

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
three main points.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
The first point

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
is

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
in the training

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
skill set

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
is always

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
an important thing.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Okay.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Not everyone

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
wants to

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
be an

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
engineer.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Okay.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
In the industry

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
when you

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
are looking for

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
a job

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
what skills

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
will you list

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
on your CV?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
The company

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
will look at

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
your skills

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
to decide

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
if you are

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
the person

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
they need.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Okay.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
So

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
scientific skills

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I think

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
when you

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
think

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
okay

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
you feel like

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
okay

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
maybe I'm not

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
that into

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
academia

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
then I think

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
skills

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
will become

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
a very

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
important

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
element

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
when you

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
are looking

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
for an

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
industry job.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Okay.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
The second

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
is literature.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I think

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
literature

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
is relatively

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
important

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
in academia

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
because

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
if you

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
want to

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
go into

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
academia

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
you need to

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
propose

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
a lot

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
of experiments.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
When you

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
propose

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
a lot of

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
experiments

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
it will

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
not

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
be a

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
random

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
experiment.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
So

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
you need to

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
know if

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
it has

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
a big

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
impact

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
so you

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
need to

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
go

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
deep

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
into

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
the

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
professional

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
subjects.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
So

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
literature

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
is a

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
very

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
important

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
element

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
especially

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
when you

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
are

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
looking

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
for an

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
industry job.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Okay.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Alright.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Let's talk

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
about the

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
scientific

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
skills.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Okay.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I think

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
when you

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
join a

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
lab

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
no,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
before you

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
join a

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
lab

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
you need to

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
know

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
what

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
skills

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
you can

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
learn

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
from

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
joining

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
this

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
lab.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Okay.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Sometimes

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
when students

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
are looking

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
for a

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
lab

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
they don't

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
know

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
what they

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
want.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
To be honest

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I think

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
more than

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
80% of

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
students

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
don't

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
know

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
what

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
they

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
want

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
because

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
they

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
haven't

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
really

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
thought

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
about

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Okay.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
So,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
when you

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
join a

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
lab

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
you

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
need to

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
know

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
what

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
skills

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
you

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
can

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
learn

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
from

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
this

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
lab.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Okay.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
So,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
when you

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
join a

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
lab

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
need to

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000

lab.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Okay.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000

lab.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Okay.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
So,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
when you

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
join a

lab.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Okay.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
So,

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
when you

recommendation

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
usually

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
happen

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
4th year

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
or

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
5th year.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Of course,

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
if you

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
want to

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
go to

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
the industry,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
okay,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
let's say

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
you want to

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
go to

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
at the

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
end of

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
3rd year.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Okay.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm not

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
interested in

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
academia.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Okay.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
I want to

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
go to

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
the industry.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Okay.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
No problem at

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
all.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
But at

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
this time,

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
you have to

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
think carefully

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
about

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
which

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
companies

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
you are

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
interested in.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
At that time,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
it's a good

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
opportunity to

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
reach out.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Okay.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Introduce them

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
and tell them

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
that I use

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
your equipment

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
and so on.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Okay.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Chat with

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
them.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Okay.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Exchange

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
information.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Let them

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
have an

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
impression

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
of you.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Okay.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
At the

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
same time,

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
let them

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
know

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
how long

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
you are

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
going to

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
graduate.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Okay.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
In this

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
year and a

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
half,

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
if he or she

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
really likes

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
you,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
then you

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
got an

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
internal

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
referral.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Okay.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Things

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
will be

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
a lot

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
easier.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Okay.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Now,

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
if you

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
want to

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
go to

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
academia,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
okay,

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
you have

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
to

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
do

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
your

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
presentation.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
If

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
everything

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
goes

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
smoothly,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
getting

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
your dream

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
postdoc position

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
is not

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
that difficult

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
either.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Okay.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Next,

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
when you

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
have identified

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
the position

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
and the

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
target,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
they will

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
usually

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
request

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
you to

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
send

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
a letter

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
to

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
your

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
letter writer

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
and

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
company

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
or

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
your

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
future

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
postdoc

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
boss.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
I

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
think

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
a lot of

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
students

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
have

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
overlooked

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
this

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
important

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
thing.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Okay.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Believe

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
or not,

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
I

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
think

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
when

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
you

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
graduate,

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
you

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
have to

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
start

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
looking

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
for

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
the

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
person

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
who

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
carries

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
the

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
most weight.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Okay.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
recently

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
graduated

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
two

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
students.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Okay.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
One

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
is going

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
to

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
the

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
academic world

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
and

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
one

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
is going

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
to

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
the

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
business

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
world.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Okay.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
received a

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
lot of

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
letters

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
from

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
my

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
co-

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
advisors.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Okay.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
So

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
you

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
must

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
know

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
who

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
is the

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
most

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
important

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
person

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
who

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
can

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
write

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
the

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
letter

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
for

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
you.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Okay.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Sometimes

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
your

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
co-

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
advisors

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
or

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
your

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
advisors

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
carry

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
your CV

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
or

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
your

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
statement of

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
purpose.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
You

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
can

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
simply

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
say

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
in

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
your

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
e-mail

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
that

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
you

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
are

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
looking

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
for

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
a company

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
and

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
what

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
they

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
need.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
You

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
can

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
write

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
more

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
details

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
about

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
the

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
company

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
or

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
the

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
company

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
you

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
are

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
looking

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
for.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Okay.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
So

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
you

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
must

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
know

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
who

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
is

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
the

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
most

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
important

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
person

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
who

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
can

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
write

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
the

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
letter

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
for

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
you.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Okay.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
I

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
have written

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
a lot of

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
letters.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Okay.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Not

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
all of them

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
are

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
very

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
powerful.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Okay.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
will

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
write

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
letters

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
that

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
are

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
very

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
powerful.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
really

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
know

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
who

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
this

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
person

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
is.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Okay.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
I

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
observe

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
the

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
time

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
and

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
the

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
incubation

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
of

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
the

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
professor.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Okay.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
I

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
will

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
write

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
powerful

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
letters.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Okay.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
recommend

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
him for

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
this

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
position.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Okay.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
This

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
is the

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
worst

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
letter

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
you

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
can

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
write.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Okay.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
This

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
is the

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
worst

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
letter

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
you

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
want to

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
have.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Okay.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Not

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
all of

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
them

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
are

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
powerful.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Okay.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
This

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
is the

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
worst

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
letter

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
you

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
want to

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
have.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Okay.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
This

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
is the

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
worst

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
letter

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
you

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
want to

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
have.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Okay.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Okay.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
This

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
is the

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
worst

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
letter

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
you

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
need to

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
learn.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Okay.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Like

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
this.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
All

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
right.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
And

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
the

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
last

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
will be

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
a

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
review

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
little

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
recommendation.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Okay.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Okay.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Now

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
come back to

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
this.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Okay.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Again, five

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
years, right?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Two phases.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Okay.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
How do

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
you accomplish

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
these tasks

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
within five

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
years?

42:46.000 --> 43:05.000
Okay.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Okay.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Okay.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Well,

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
I can't really share my thoughts on this.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
Because everyone really has different needs.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
So, I think that the way I usually go about it is

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
to think long term first.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm the type of person who starts to think long term and then slowly goes back to short term.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
But some people like to start short term and then slowly go back to long term.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Either way is fine.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
But I think that if I were to do this,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
I would start with what my goal is for this semester.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Okay.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Let's say that's my goal.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
How far should I go in terms of time allocation

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
in the first month and how far should I go in the second month?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Okay.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
If I have a goal for this month,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
what should I do every week?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Right?

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
Then you can slowly go back to how far you want to go every day.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Okay.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
PhD is a marathon.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Okay.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
It's a five-year process.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
So, in the middle of this process,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
I think planned vacation is also very important.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Okay.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
When I was studying for my PhD,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
every summer vacation,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm a person who really likes to go to National Park.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
So, every summer vacation,

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
I would force myself to go to a National Park.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Okay.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So, I've been to a lot of different National Parks.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Okay.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
I think that's a process that allows you to recharge yourself.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So, after these five years,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
you won't feel like you're totally burned out.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Okay.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
I think the most important thing is to let yourself enjoy this process.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
All right?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Okay.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Finally,

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
I want to use this slide to summarize today's presentation.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Okay.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Okay.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
I think mentality is a very, very important thing.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Okay.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Okay.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Okay.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Okay.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Okay.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Okay.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Okay.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Okay.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Okay.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Okay.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Okay.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Okay.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Okay.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Okay.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Okay.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Okay.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Okay.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Okay.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
But the most important thing is that, okay,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
you can only improve when you do your presentation.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Okay.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
If you don't improve, you will only feel good about yourself.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Okay.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
You have to really do these things.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Okay.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
It won't be too beautiful at first.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Okay.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
But that is okay because that is not your,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
that is not your last presentation.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Okay.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
In this process, no matter what you do,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
you are just preparing for the last one.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Okay.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
So you'd rather practice as many times as you can in this process.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Okay.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The more times you practice, the better.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Once you know how to fold,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
you won't fold like this in the future.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Okay.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
So I think it's good for you to experience a lot of setbacks.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Of course, it's hard on your mind.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Okay.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
But when you fold a lot of times,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
your mind becomes relatively strong.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Okay.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Then your endurance becomes very, very high.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Okay.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
So I would strongly recommend that everyone is able to,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
don't be shy.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Okay.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
You can do a presentation,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
go out and do a presentation.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Even if you know you are not ready,

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
but still do it.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Okay.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Then, um,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
last, last, last.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I think this is actually not what I wrote.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
There are goals, there are opportunities, there are plans.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
This is not what I'm talking about.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Okay.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
This is what Zhang Zhongmeng said.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Once I listened to his speech,

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
I think these things are very suitable for PhD students.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Okay.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Like I said, five years is not a long time,

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
not a short time, right?

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
But in order to be efficient to accomplish your goal,

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
having a goal is very, very important.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Because only if you have a goal,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
then you can have a plan.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Okay.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Without a goal, there is no plan.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Okay.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
So the goal and the plan are actually put together.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Okay.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
The goal is your focus.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
The plan is just a means to pursue the goal.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Okay.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Then there is a discipline.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Discipline is something that everyone should know.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Because in this process,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
it's not an easy process.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Okay.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
In order to really achieve to a certain level,

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
discipline is very, very, very important.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Right.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
I believe that if you talk to a lot of junior faculty,

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
you will find that their life is actually very, very boring.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Okay.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
It's usually a point-to-point life.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
And what they do every day is basically the same.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Okay.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
But it's because of these tedious processes.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Okay.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Causing this routine.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Okay.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Let them become a very disciplined person.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Okay.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
That's because of these disciplines.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
So that he can make a breakthrough in many aspects.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
All right.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Okay.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
So in the end, I hope to be able to use this.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Have a goal, have a discipline, have a plan.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Three yes.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
To end today's speech.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
If you have any questions,

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
I am more than happy to answer the question.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Thank you.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
Thank you for Tai-Yan's sharing.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
When I was listening just now,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I felt very agreeable.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's like nodding your head.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Okay.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
I want to reiterate some points.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Because I just got on the job.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I am also a junior faculty.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
Tai-Yan just talked about these.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
About presentation.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Of course,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Everyone is young.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
When you are a Ph.D. student,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
You have learned a lot of skills.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
But we are more.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
There is no point to pay attention to.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
I think it is.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Eventually it will become a very important point.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Presentation and networking.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Tai-Yan just said.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
There are some very practical practices.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Don't go to a conference without presentation.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I think this is very important.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
How to interact with others in the conference.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It is a very important point.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Also,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Tai-Yan just mentioned.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
The letter from your advisor carries a lot of weight.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I can't agree more.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
Your advisor can push you up.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Can also push you down.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
So this is a very important thing.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
Do you have any questions here?

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
This is a fairly open space.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Everyone can ask any questions.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
As long as you turn on the microphone.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
By the way,

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
Patrick Winston's talk.

50:43.000 --> 50:51.000
It was a reference when I was preparing my job talk.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
How to speak.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
YouTube video.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
It is my reference.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I think he said very well.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Tai-Yan just said.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
When you talk about presentation.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
You have to talk to people outside your field.

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
My wife has heard my job talk hundreds of times.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So this is a very good way.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I can't agree more.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Do you have any questions?

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
You can just turn on the microphone and ask.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Can you hear me?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yes, I can hear you.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Can you introduce yourself first?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I want to say that everyone is so shy.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Let me ask first.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I am Lin Zhanhong.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
I am currently at the Leibniz Research Center in Germany.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
PhD student.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
It is currently the last year.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
In the writing stage.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Thank you for your speech.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
For the presentation and writing.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
Whether it is thesis or paper part.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
I think maybe.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
This is what I can refer to at the moment.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
Because I am currently writing my thesis.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
In fact, I am more interested in asking the teacher.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
I want to ask the teacher.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
The first question is about cross-field.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Because I think the teacher seems to be from before.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
By the way, I used to be a chemistry major.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
So I should call it a senior.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Then I want to ask the teacher.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
Because I see that your field seems to have changed a lot.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
About this cross-field part.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
The teacher just mentioned that maybe.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Enter a new field.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
The fastest way is to put it first.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Find out the important fields in the first five years.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Then read it.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Then sort out your own summary.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
But what I want to ask is that.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
What is the teacher's opinion on this cross-field?

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
The teacher, do you think that in the original field.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I mean the cross-field is to say.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Is it a completely unrelated field?

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Or is it a little bit combined?

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
But maybe.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
There are some overlaps.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
There are some overlaps.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
But it may not be completely related.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Then I don't know the teacher.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I mainly want to ask the teacher.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
What do you think about the cross-field?

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
It's about the advantages and disadvantages of future development.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Because the other one is to see.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
The teacher's post-doc has also been doing it for a long time.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
According to the academic world in Taiwan, as far as I know.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
It seems to be too long.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
So I just want to ask the teacher.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
What do you think about these things?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I think about the cross-field.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I think I can be a representative of the cross-field.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Because the field is really quite wide.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
From material chemistry.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Material physics.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Then it becomes biological physics.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
To neurobiology.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
In fact, it doesn't seem to have much to do with it.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
So I think about the cross-field.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Is it good?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
OK.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
So what is everyone's approach?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It's usually not so exaggerated.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
Mine is more like a 90-degree turn.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
The general practice is probably.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It's amazing to turn 30 degrees.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
That's a safer way.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
OK.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Because basically.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
I think even if you only turn 30 degrees.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
OK.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Then expand your research scope.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
This thing is actually quite difficult.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Yes.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
What about the time?

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Of course, it's a very, very important factor.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
OK.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
I think I can be a postdoc for so long.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
The main reason is because.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I have a very supportive family.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
With a very supportive advisor.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
OK.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Inevitable.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
If you say you are missing one.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It's not going to work.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
OK.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
You are going to live in hell.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
OK.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So I don't recommend everyone.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Is to make such a drastic change.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Yes.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
What are the benefits?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
The benefit is that when you come to life.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
You become very unique.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
OK.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
You can easily find some on research.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Scientific niche.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
That you can be the only one.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Who can do this.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
OK.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
That will become a very good one.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
If you can survive.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Then you can live relatively easily.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Because you start to define the field.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
OK.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Because no one is doing that.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
You are the only one.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Then you define the field.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Right.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
If you are the first one.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Who define the field.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Then people follow you.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Then.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Things is actually easier.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
OK.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
But if you say.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
You just follow the direction of others.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Then you will start.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
You need to be very careful.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Because.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Whatever you say.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
OK.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
There will always be someone.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Researcher.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Start arguing with you.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Yes.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
So.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
The advantage of doing cross-field research is.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
You may be easier to find.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
A scientific niche.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
To contribute.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
What you have learned.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
It is also easier to find new knowledge.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Come.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Push the front of the field.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
OK.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
So I think that is a big plus.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
OK.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
When doing this.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Because you changed the field.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
The corresponding price is.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
The cost of time.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
OK.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
The cost of time.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Can you accept it?

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
Can your family accept it?

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Right.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Is your teacher willing to accept it?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Then this thing.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
It becomes natural.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Like I said.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Like I said.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
I think I am a lucky person.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Because.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
My wife is very, very supportive.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
OK.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
My family is very, very, very supportive.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
That.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
My researcher boss.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
I am a post office boss.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Tell me directly.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Wife, how long do you want to stay?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Yes.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
So.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
It creates a.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
I think.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I can do this.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
OK.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
The point is.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
When I do this.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
How do I feel?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Do I still enjoy this process?

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I think that's the point.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
If I don't enjoy this process.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I have to force myself to turn around.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I think that's the meaning.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Right.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
So.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Generally speaking.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I think.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
If you really want to do cross-field.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Don't turn so much.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
OK.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Turn 30 degrees.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
OK.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
It's quite similar to what you did before.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I think it's already a pretty good one.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Uh.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
It should also be said that it is a more reasonable approach.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
OK.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
The feasibility is also a little higher.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
OK.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Compared to your other requirements.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Maybe you can lose a little bit.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Then I think.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Is a good way.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Right.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
That.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
No.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
There is another.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
What other questions are there?

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
I said.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Is to.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Comment on the interdisciplinary research.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Then.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
The general.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Thinking about.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
The.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
How you should actually do that.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
So that.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
You know.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
It has a higher chance to.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Make it work.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
OK.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
So I think.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Don't turn too much.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
That.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
But you have to turn.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
OK.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
When you are looking for a teacher later.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
You will definitely be asked the question.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Is.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
How do you.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
With your previous.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Uh.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
PEI group.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Compete.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
OK.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
So I think the cross-field thing.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Must be done.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Because.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
In the single field.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
In fact.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Simple things.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Everyone is basically done.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Right.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Ah.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
If it's too difficult.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
When you start.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Your faculty position.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
You don't have that much time to spend.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Right.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Right.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
If you want to survive.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
If.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
I think.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
That's not a good approach.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
So.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Involve some new things.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
I think it's a.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Good direction.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
OK.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
How much do you want to involve?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
It depends on the individual's own conditions.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
I hope this answer.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Yes, yes, yes.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
I probably have some ideas.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
That.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Another question.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
I mainly want to ask the teacher.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
That is.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
About.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Uh.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Decide the academic world.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Stay in the academic world.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Continue to try.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Or.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Uh.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
To go to the industry.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
That.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
This is.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Uh.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Uh.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Uh.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Uh.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Uh.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Uh.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Uh.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
This time point.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
With a change of mentality.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Is there any.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Is there.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
The first one is.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Is there a clear time point?

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
That is.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
When do you need.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Meta decision.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
That's another one.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Is there anything.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
How to say.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Is the point to be decided.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
And the direction of the decision.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
About.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
This issue.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Is.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't know if the teacher has any suggestions.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
I think.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
Of course.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
It's just me.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
OK.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
If.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
You start looking for.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
OK.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
That.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
When you're in the first year.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
When.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
If you say.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
You have found the interview.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
If the opportunity.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
OK.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
But you didn't go.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
That.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
The second year.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
You have more interview opportunities.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
But you haven't.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
That.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
I think you can.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Concede.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
Turn to the industry.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
That.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
The reason I say that.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Mainly because.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
In my opinion.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
It's.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
It's.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
It's.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
It's.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
It's.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
It's.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
It's.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Mainly because.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
In the example I see.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Once you.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Fail for twice.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
OK.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
You have to find another.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Uh.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Uh.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Uh.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Uh.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Uh.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Uh.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Uh.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Uh.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Uh.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Uh.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Uh.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Uh.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Uh.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Uh.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Uh.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Uh.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Uh.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Uh.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Uh.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Uh.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Uh.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Uh.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Uh.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Uh.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Uh.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Uh.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Uh.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Uh.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Uh.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Uh.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Uh.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Uh.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Uh.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Uh.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Uh.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Uh.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Uh.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Uh.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Uh.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Uh.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Uh.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Uh.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Uh.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Uh.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Uh.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Uh.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Uh.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Uh.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Uh.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Uh.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Uh.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Uh.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Uh.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Uh.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So my personal feeling, again, my personal feeling.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:47.000
If you are in the second year, if you have the opportunity to interview for the second time, but you still don't have the position, then I guess that maybe there are some things that we did not realize, but other, uh.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Uh.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Uh, so the committee that you see might be a problem, so I think it might be a matter of whether to think about whether to change the career path that would be more suitable for yourself.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Ok, after all, uh, I just talked to everybody. Ok, this matter of education is actually the condition itself. Of course, it's important, but we all think it's great, it's almost 50 percent.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
The other 50 percent is more related to the formation of the committee of the direction of the department.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So if you say that it's not very smooth when you're looking for a teacher, you don't have to be too depressed.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You just didn't meet the right search committee at the right time.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Ok, then the department did not provide you with the direction of the department and your direction did not match.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Ok, it's less simple. It's not that you are not good enough. Ok, so I think the change in mentality does not have to be denied.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Ok, then I think that if you want to consider it bad luck, I think it's totally fine.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Ok, it's really just that this thing is too complicated and involves too many factors.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Ok, it's not that I'm going to do my best and I'm going to have a position, it's not like that.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yes, I have a lot of friends who perform better than me in science.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
In the end, they just don't have a position.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Then you would say that I am better than them. I don't think so either.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They just don't have the position they want when they vote.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
That fit is not very good.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Then this kind of person goes to the industry, I think they will be crazy, because they are really good.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So I think that if you say that you are not good at the academic world and transfer to the industry, I don't think it's a sad thing.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I don't think it's necessary, because you have a very good platform that can really let you shine.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Ok, thank you for your answer. I think maybe let everyone ask.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Do you have any questions?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I very much agree.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000
When we were just talking about finding a faculty position, the component of luck is really big.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
In addition to the search committee of the other school, who will compete with you that year?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
This thing is also different every year.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Can I comment on the search committee?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
We just talked about outreach.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
At the beginning, we were focusing on graduate student outreach, right?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You have to do this more thoroughly when you are a postdoc.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Because you need more recognition letters.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So you really need to get to know the people in your field.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It will make it easier for you when you are a postdoc.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That's right.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It seems that someone just wanted to ask a question.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Is it?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Hello, I am.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the United States.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I have been studying for four years.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I think what I just shared is a lot of success.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Mainly because I am now in a research proposal stage.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:30.000
What I want to ask is how to set the vision goal when writing a proposal.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I don't want it to be too big that I can't control it.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
But I don't want it to be too small that there is no room for it.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I want to set a goal and a vision.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.000
My main career goal is to achieve my goal.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
If that's the case, what should I set?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
A PSD proposal goal and vision.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I think this should be your boss's job.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:19.000
My suggestion is to write out the outline first.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Then discuss it with your teacher.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The teacher will provide some reasonable judgment.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
After all, it's your major.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It's hard for me to give you meaningful comments here.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000
But I think in general, I will ask my students to show me what they think.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Let's discuss and see if what you think is reasonable.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I think you need to practice more on writing outlines.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Think about your significance.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
When you write something, is it significant?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
In the end, when you write a proposal, significance is the most important factor.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
After thinking about your significance,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
How do you approach this problem?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It's worth thinking about.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I think the earlier you write out your outline,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It's best to discuss with your teacher as soon as possible.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Because your teacher can make the most reasonable comment about your research significance.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
If your teacher doesn't think your significance is high,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I think you can change the topic as soon as possible.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I think writing a proposal is something you might want to specialize in later.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I don't think many doctoral students have the experience of writing a proposal.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
If you have a chance, I suggest you try to write a proposal.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
When you're writing your proposal experiment,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
There's a little bit of that feeling.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I think you can take this opportunity to make it more complete.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Is that okay?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Yes, thank you.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I have another question.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:56.000
How independent should PhD students be?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:10.000
How independent should PhD students be?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
This is related to PhDs.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Every lab is different.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But I found one thing.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I think teachers and students need some time to build their mutual trust.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
If you have mutual trust,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I think if you want to provide enough evidence to support your argument,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
The boss usually won't be too strongly opposed.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
If the boss has a strong desire to oppose what you propose,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
That means you haven't reached that level in his heart.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
How do you build mutual trust?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I think it's very important to have the ability to experiment.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And can you clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000
If you can clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Even if the project doesn't work, the teacher is still willing to trust you.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So I think it takes some incubation time to build that trust.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:31.000
That incubation time depends on whether the students are really professional when presenting their results.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I think it's usually the general teacher.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Of course, some teachers are exceptions.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
If the general teacher sees that students can really be responsible for what they do,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And can really make things clear, complete and reasonable,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Then I guess if you want to do a new project in the lab later,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Or if you come up with something and you want to continue,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
The teacher will have a higher chance of agreeing.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Otherwise, in fact, on the practical operating surface,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The problem is that the teacher's funding is actually for specific projects.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
So sometimes they can't deviate.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
If you propose a proposal and it deviates too far from the original proposal,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
He may not be able to provide financial support.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It's not that he doesn't trust you, he just doesn't have the potential.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Does that make sense?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Thank you very much.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Then my question ends here.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Okay, everyone should have heard me talk just now.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That's the end of our Q&A session.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Then everyone will turn on the microphone again.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Let's applaud and thank Taiyan.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Thank you, everyone.
