00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Oh, maybe I can think about it first. I probably won't provide slides because I know a lot of participants will want slides, but I won't provide slides.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Anyway, there are recordings, so I think it should be fine.

00:30.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Taira is a friendly environment for young researchers in Taiwan.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
We hold Taira Talk every weekend.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
The format and content of this talk are very diverse.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Academic researchers can share their research results here according to their occupations,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
and also practice live presentations or meet future potential partners.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Today is the first lecture of the Taira 2022 Overseas Researcher Application Guidelines.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
The topic is European Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Next week will be the North American Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
Next week, August 28th, will be two types of application documents, CV and SOP writing skills.

01:45.000 --> 01:56.000
We mentioned in the propaganda file and application form that if you are willing to participate in one-on-one Ph.D. application mentoring,

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
if you sign up and attend the first or second lecture, plus the third CV and SOP writing lecture,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
you will have the opportunity to mentor first.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Let me briefly explain this one-on-one guidance.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
This year, we have invited many young scholars with overseas study experience to serve as mentors

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
to help Taiwanese students prepare for various applications,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
such as school consultations, interview preparation, etc.

02:26.000 --> 02:36.000
The mentors selected can apply for mentors according to their own conditions, such as the field of research, the target school, etc.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Then the mentors can choose mentors that are suitable for help according to their personal wishes.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
We expect to recruit about 100 mentors this year,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
because the registration situation in the past was quite intense,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
so if the number of applicants exceeds,

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
if you participate in this series of lectures in August, you will have the opportunity to mentor first.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
So we highly encourage everyone to participate in the third CV and SOP lecture.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
At the same time, we also hope that everyone can listen to our other TerraTalks in the future.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
We have continued to update the lecture list on our official website.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
You are also welcome to follow our Facebook and Instagram.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
You can also join the Terra membership for free and enjoy more membership exclusive rights.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
You can have more interactions with other mentors.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
I will post the registration form for joining the membership in the chat later.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Today's event will issue a Terra badge as a certificate of participation.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
This is an NFT, which is a completely open and unalterable record.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
For more information, please see the chat link.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
To join the certificate, you must first install the PoAP app.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
You can first scan the QR code in the chat link to install the PoAP app.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
We will announce the password to receive the badge after the lecture.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
If your phone cannot install the app, please stay after the lecture.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
We will help you solve it.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Later, we will invite two speakers to share their thoughts.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
After the lecture, we will have a Q&A session.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Finally, we will issue the NFT.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Today, we welcome the first speaker.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
He is Dr. Zhang Zhaoyuan from the University of Dresden.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
His field of research is business engineering.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
According to Terra's tradition, we will turn on the microphone.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I will end my slideshare.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I will turn on the microphone again.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his thoughts.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Thank you for the invitation, Project Terra.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
I will share my experience applying for a university in Europe.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I am Zhang Zhaoyuan.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
As the host said, I am currently studying my Ph.D. at Dresden.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Before coming to Germany, I studied at Cornell University.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I studied Biomedical Engineering for one year.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I will not talk about the U.S. part of today's talk.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't know if you are still hesitating to apply for a university in the U.S. or Europe.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I will leave this part for Q&A.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
I have a few slides to share about the difference between the European system and the U.S. system.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
As I said, I don't know what your current status is.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
If you are still a blank sheet, and don't know how to start your Ph.D.,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I think the most important thing is to ask yourself what your motivation is.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It may sound vague.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I won't teach you how to write a document today.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
But your motivation will affect how you write your documents.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Even if you are lucky enough to get an interview offer, you will be asked.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
If your motivation is not strong enough,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
the interviewer or the person reviewing your document will be able to tell.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
In this case, you may be less competitive than other candidates.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
So you have to ask yourself why you want to apply for a Ph.D.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Why do you want to study for a master's degree? Why do you want to study for a Ph.D.?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Why do you want to study abroad?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
These are all important.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Otherwise, you can stay in Taiwan.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
In the field of engineering, you can do very well in Taiwan.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
In Taiwan, the Peninsula Institute is very famous.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You can finish a master's degree or Ph.D.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Then you can go to the Peninsula Institute.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You can make a lot of money.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
So why do you want to study abroad?

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
After studying abroad, what are the requirements?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
These are the things you have to do.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
So at this stage, if you haven't prepared anything,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
the time you need the most is to do some research.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Which school should I study?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Which university should I study?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Do I have the opportunity to apply for a Ph.D.?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
These are the things we can discuss later.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
I applied for a Ph.D. in Germany.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I only applied for a Ph.D.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
But in principle, it can be applied to most European and EU countries.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
In the traditional European system,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
it's a bit like looking for a job.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Our Chinese is called teacher-student system.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
If you see a professor who has a Ph.D. position,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
you can write a letter to tell him,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I saw you applied for a Ph.D. position.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
What's my background?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm interested in this topic.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
He may ask you to add your resume, motivation, etc.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
If he thinks it's OK, he'll say,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
OK, let's have an interview.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
After the conversation, he might say,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
OK, I think you're good. I want to hire you.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Tell me when you're coming.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
That's it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You and the boss are set.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Another one is the structured Ph.D. program.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
You may be familiar with it.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
It's adapted from English-speaking countries,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
such as the US, the UK, Australia, or even Taiwan.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
It's a Ph.D. program.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
You have to apply to a certain department or Ph.D. program.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It usually has a lot of requirements.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Because it's a program,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
it may require you to do lab rotation during your Ph.D.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
You have to take classes, etc.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
You have to meet certain requirements to be able to defend yourself.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
But for a teacher-student system,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
you have to go into the lab to do research.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
It doesn't require you to take classes, etc.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
to graduate.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
This is the biggest difference

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
between a teacher-student system

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
and a structured program.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Most structured programs,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I'll talk about it later,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
besides universities and so-called research institutes,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
when it provides a structured program,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
it's not unlimited.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Unlike in Taiwan,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
when you graduate, you have to wait for your teacher's approval.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's the same for a teacher-student system.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But in general,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
for a structured program,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
it usually gives you a 2-3 year contract,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
up to 1 year.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So for most structured programs,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
the average Ph.D. year is around 4 years.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
So how do I start looking for my Ph.D. position?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I didn't put a website here.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
You can just type in the title,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
like Nature Career, Uroxas,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
or just type in your Ph.D.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's just a website.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Then you can search for your Ph.D. position.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
There are a few filter conditions.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It depends on how you want to filter.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Some of these are from the EU.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You might want to go to Germany,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
or the UK, etc.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You can filter by yourself.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Nature Career,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
in terms of reading a Ph.D. in the EU,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
they see it as a job.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So from Nature Career,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
you can also see a lot of

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
European Ph.D. positions.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Uroxas,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
is from the EU.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It has a special

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
fellowship.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I'll talk about it later.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And then there are

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
some other platforms,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
like Ph.D. Scholarly B.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Of course,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
if you know

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
which universities you want to go to,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
you can go to

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
one of the universities

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and find a teacher.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If you're interested,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
you can write a letter

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
asking if you're interested

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
in your research,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
and if you want to

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
get a Ph.D.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It'll tell you

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
if you're in the right position.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Or if you want to

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
apply for a program

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
in my lab,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
it'll tell you if you're

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
in the right network.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Social media,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
like Facebook,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Instagram,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Twitter,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
a lot of professors

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
have their own Twitter

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
or lab Twitter.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
If you have a Ph.D.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
or post-doc position,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
you can post

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
from there.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I prefer

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
more and more people

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
are using LinkedIn.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It's a network opportunity.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
If you have a professor

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and he posts his position,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
you can set a job alert.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You can set a keyword

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
like Ph.D. Student,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Ph.D. Scholar,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
or Ph.D. Researcher.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Your country can be

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Europe or Germany.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It'll tell you

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
which Ph.D. positions

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
you can apply for.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Let's talk about

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
what's special

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
about studying Ph.D.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
in Europe.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We usually

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
focus on

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
universities.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But in Europe,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
universities are more

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
about teaching.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But in Europe,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
there are a lot of

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
institutes.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
A lot of

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
big international companies

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
also have Ph.D. positions.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I mentioned

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
some special

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
fellowships in EU.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
We'll talk about it later.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I can't talk about

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
all the institutes

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
in EU.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I'll talk about

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
the four most famous

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
institutes in Germany.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There are also

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I'll try.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I'll try.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
When I was at the Academy,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
if you can see

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
in the chat,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I posted about

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
joining TARA

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
and our

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Facebook fan page.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
The latest

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
news is

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
our Linktree.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
There are a lot of

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
information about TARA.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Can you see it now?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Can you see it now?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Yes, I can.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Can you see

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
my presentation slides?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Yes, I can.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Yes, I can.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Thank you.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Thank you.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Today,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'll talk about

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
European Economics.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I applied for

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
European Economics.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Compared to

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
the previous speaker,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I think

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
European Economics

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
should be

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
a bit different

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
from the

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
lab environment.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
lab environment.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
So,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I'll start

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
by introducing myself.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I'll start with my background

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
so that you can understand

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
what kind of

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
perspective I have

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
when it comes to

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
European Economics.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I'll talk about

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
my preparation

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
for European Economics.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Then,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I'll talk about

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
how to choose a school

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
and my research topic.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I'll also talk about

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
my budget

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and my salary

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
in Europe.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Finally,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I'll talk about

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
my academic background.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I studied in Taiwan

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
from 2014 to 2018,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
but my master's degree

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
was in Europe.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
From 2018 to 2019,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I studied for one year,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and from 2019 to 2020,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I studied for two years.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
From 2021,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I went to my doctorate

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
and started writing my thesis.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
My research topic

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
is economic development

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and armed conflicts

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
in the United Nations.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I'll talk about my preparation

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
for my doctorate.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
You may be curious

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
about how much you need

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
to study to get

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
a doctorate

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
in the field of

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
social science.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I used to ask

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
some teachers

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
in Taiwan University

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
if I didn't get

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
a doctorate

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
in high-level economics

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
or high-level statistics.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
In fact,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
it's not so certain.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
It depends on your goal.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
If you want to

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
study pure theoretical

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
economic theory,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
high-level economics

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
or high-level statistics

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
are really necessary.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
However,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
as long as you can

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
get a doctorate,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
you won't have

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
too many problems.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
If you want to

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
study economics,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
you need to know

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
whether you like

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
individual,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
general,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
or economic economics.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
You also need to know

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
whether you need

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
a master's degree

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
in Taiwan,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
because

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
in the U.S.,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
there are not so many choices

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
for a master's degree.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
In the U.S.,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
a lot of master's degrees

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
are held

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
not for

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
a master's degree,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
but for

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
a master's degree.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
In the U.S.,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
a master's degree

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
is given to you

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
as a scholarship.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
In Chicago,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
there are some good

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
scholarships,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
but the tuition

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
is very expensive.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
In contrast,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I chose to study

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
a master's degree in Europe

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
because the tuition

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
is relatively cheap.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
When I studied

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
a master's degree in the Netherlands,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
the tuition was 2000 euros per year.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
In the U.S.,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
a master's degree

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
can expand

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
your academic network

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
and allow you

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
to adapt to

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
the environment

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
of studying abroad.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
After two years,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
you can decide

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
whether you want

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
to apply for a doctor's degree

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
in Europe or

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
in the U.S.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
In my opinion,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
even if you decide

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
to apply for a doctor's degree

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
in Taiwan,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
a lot of people

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
apply for a doctor's degree

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
in Taiwan

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
after two years

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
of studying

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
a master's degree.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Some people

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
apply for a doctor's degree

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
after two years

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
of studying

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
a doctor's degree

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
after two years

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
of studying

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
a doctor's degree

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
in Taiwan.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Some countries

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
allow you

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
to start writing

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
your thesis

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
after two years

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
of studying

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
a doctor's degree

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
in Taiwan.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
In my opinion,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
you can start

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
writing your thesis

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
after two years

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
In the past

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
three or four years,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
many people

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000

Erasmus, Tilburg, Mannheim, Munich, Leuven, Brown

50:24.000 --> 50:44.000
So if you want to apply for a top-30 school in the U.S., there are many schools in Europe that can be compared.

50:44.000 --> 50:56.000
I think the topic is very different from science and engineering, because we usually write a paper with only one person's name,

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
instead of having a lot of co-authors or a whole lab to complete a project.

51:02.000 --> 51:14.000
I think the topic is very important for social science students, because sometimes you have to write a research plan yourself,

51:14.000 --> 51:22.000
and you have to go all the way from the literature review to the research method, and even if you want to do practical evidence, you have to have information, or you have to do interviews, and so on.

51:22.000 --> 51:32.000
All of these have to be written in great detail, but before you apply for a doctoral program, do you have such a detailed research plan?

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the type of doctoral program you choose.

51:38.000 --> 51:50.000
As I mentioned before, American doctoral programs usually start with a training course, and they say that if you have passed the training course in the first two years, you will start writing your own thesis in the third year.

51:50.000 --> 51:58.000
If you want to apply for a U.S. doctoral program, they basically do not require a research plan during the application process.

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
In Europe, it is divided into a similar model in the United States, or you can start writing your thesis directly.

52:04.000 --> 52:14.000
In Europe, the deadline for writing a thesis is usually three to four years, unlike the United States, where you can write it for four or five years.

52:14.000 --> 52:34.000
So, I think this is quite important. If you come to Europe today and decide to start studying for a doctoral program, I think you should be very clear about your research topic, what kind of topic you have, and whether you can complete this doctoral thesis in the next three to four years.

52:34.000 --> 52:46.000
So, if you start writing your thesis directly when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program, you usually have to go through the research plan when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program.

52:46.000 --> 53:02.000
As I mentioned earlier, in Germany and the Netherlands, you are a school employee, and your job title is a PhD researcher.

53:02.000 --> 53:20.000
In Belgium, most of my salary is in contact with HR, but I am not a full-time school employee. What I get is not a job contract, but a scholarship letter.

53:20.000 --> 53:40.000
So, some benefits are not the same. For example, I don't have a pension, but if you are in the Netherlands, the school will give you a pension, which is like a pension. It should be considered a pension, but I only have social security insurance.

53:40.000 --> 53:57.000
So, the benefits are not the same, but my benefit is that I don't get paid for my work, so I don't have to be taxed for my salary. But in the Netherlands, your salary will be deducted first.

53:57.000 --> 54:22.000
In terms of economics, the monthly income is about 1,700 to 2,000 euros. If you start writing your thesis first, you will get a scholarship letter, which is about 500 euros per month, and some people get 1,200 euros.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
In other words, even if you are in the master's program, as long as you save enough money, you don't have to spend too much money on your master's program.

54:29.000 --> 54:43.000
In the Netherlands and Germany, there are more of these methods. In the first two years of your master's program, you have a chance to get a scholarship.

54:44.000 --> 54:58.000
I think it's important to figure out your source of income, because if you study abroad and spend your youth, you may be 30 years old after studying for 34 years. You don't want to be in debt after studying.

54:59.000 --> 55:19.000
So if you find that your source of income is a master's program, which is more like a master's program, and every August you have to ask the professor and the HR of the school to confirm that the student's budget can be extended for another year.

55:20.000 --> 55:33.000
So my scholarship letter is not given once every four years, but it is renewed every year. At first, I was afraid that the teacher would be displeased with me, or I would be lazy, so I decided not to renew it.

55:34.000 --> 55:50.000
I think this is a tricky point for a master's program. You really have to make sure that the teacher's personality is normal and he is a good person. Otherwise, I have heard that the teacher is unhappy and the master's program can only be terminated for half a year.

55:50.000 --> 56:05.000
My personal experience is that I used to study in the Netherlands and Belgium, and my boyfriend is now studying economics in Germany, and I also applied to a German school.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
I have been talking about Europe and other countries, and now I want to talk about these three countries more clearly.

56:12.000 --> 56:25.000
In the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a one-year or two-year master's program. In Spain, I studied for one year, but why did I study for another two years in the Netherlands?

56:25.000 --> 56:47.000
Usually, a one-year master's program is not considered to be a program that allows you to write a thesis. It stipulates that you need to have 120 ECTS. You don't have to worry about the points. If you study for two years in Taiwan, you will definitely be able to write a thesis in Europe.

56:47.000 --> 57:09.000
However, if you study for one year in Europe, most students will want to study for another two years. In the Netherlands, the two-year master's program is generally referred to as a research master's program.

57:09.000 --> 57:34.000
In fact, it is a bit like the UK, where there is a difference between MSc and MPhil. In Germany, the two-year master's program is basically two years. So whether you are studying for MSc or MSc, it is still a two-year course. The first year is a basic course, and the second year you start writing a thesis.

57:34.000 --> 57:52.000
In terms of language, many people will think that I am studying in Europe today. Usually, I am not sure what the literature field is, but at least in economics, all programs and school requirements are based on English.

57:52.000 --> 58:13.000
If you are in the Netherlands, you don't have to worry too much about whether you want to learn Dutch. If you live in the French-speaking area of ​​Belgium or in Germany, I think learning a little language is a good thing, and it is also a leisure other than studying for a master's program. Otherwise, English is basically enough.

58:14.000 --> 58:33.000
Usually, the language requirements related to social science are relatively high, such as TOEFL and IELTS. However, TOEFL requires at least 100 points, and IELTS requires at least 7 points or more.

58:33.000 --> 58:49.000
In terms of immigration, I think the reason why you want to go to a certain country to study is not only because of the school, but also because you want to plan your entire career. If I graduate, can I stay here to work or even apply for permanent residence?

58:49.000 --> 59:09.000
I think there is a big point to consider, and that is whether you can get a work contract. I have been in Europe since 2018, but my years are in different countries, so I can't transfer to permanent residence.

59:09.000 --> 59:27.000
For example, I have been studying in Belgium for 4 years, and I have been in Europe for 7 years, so I can't apply for permanent residence, because I am taking a student's scholarship, not a job. However, in the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.

59:27.000 --> 59:45.000
In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved. In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.

59:45.000 --> 01:00:12.000
In terms of employment opportunities, I think there are more job opportunities in Europe than in Taiwan, because in economics, in the EU, you can often find companies like competition economics or competition consulting, but there are fewer such industries in Taiwan, and most people are still in the financial industry.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:31.000
For example, some people like social impact, or some areas that are considered not profitable in Taiwan, but I think there are many opportunities in Europe, and this is why I want to come to Europe to study, and even stay here to work in the future.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:45.000
My application experience goes back to the basics, which is how to apply for a doctorate. The offer I got at that time was one in Germany, one in Belgium, and one in the Netherlands.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:01:04.000
In Germany, it is a 5-year doctorate class, which is a 2-year class plus a 3-year thesis. In the Netherlands, it is also 2 years plus 4 years or 2 years plus 3 years.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So, if you want to write a letter to the professor, in fact, like in Germany, there was no need to write a letter to the professor in the second half of the Netherlands and the second half of the Netherlands, but in Luwen, where I am now, because it is a master-apprentice relationship, the teacher opened a circle on his website or the school's website and said that I now have a research plan, and I can hire a doctorate student for this plan.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:50.000
If you are interested in this position, you can write a letter to me with your CV and motivation, and then the teacher will look at the information you sent him and see if he is interested in you.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So, like this, if you see a job position, you usually start writing your thesis directly. This is the case in both Belgium and Germany, and it is relatively rare in the Netherlands, but it is also the case.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So, in fact, it's back to Europe, because in the beginning of Europe, they are all master-apprentices, but it's just because economics is more similar to the US training method. It allows you to take two more years of classes before you write your thesis to ensure that the training you receive is of a certain level.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:47.000
As I said earlier, the entrance requirements of the doctoral class are to find a way to do your own related courses in college, and then if you write your thesis in Taiwan and teach in Taiwan, then basically your own thesis should be able to be presented in English to your future doctoral class.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:10.000
The motivation and research plan really depend on what field you want to study. For example, I said at the beginning that I wanted to study economic development because I was also doing economic development in the past, and I was also very interested in this part.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:24.000
In terms of recommendations, I think it is a very important reason for deciding whether you will go to a certain school, at least in economics.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Because when I was in Manhattan, my recommendation was a professor when I was studying in Barcelona, and it just so happens that the professor of the Manhattan Graduate Committee was staying in Barcelona before, so he knew those two professors.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I think that in the academic world, your skill sets are usually so-called soft skills, which means that you may be very good at writing, you may have a lot of ideas, or you may have a lot of research ideas, but these things are not so easy to quantify.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Because we usually publish a lot of papers when we are not in the undergraduate master's program. These hard-to-quantify skills are actually based on your recommendation and your recommender to help you present.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:16.000
This is because I just wanted to add that, in fact, what is the standard of living in Europe with 1200 euros of master's scholarships or 2000 euros of doctoral scholarships? I think it is absolutely enough.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The advantage of living in Europe is that I don't know how to drive, but I think a lot of students who study in the U.S. will not be able to go anywhere if they don't know how to drive.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But I didn't have time to learn how to drive when I was in Taiwan, so I had to come out and study. But I think in Europe, you don't have to be afraid of driving.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The advantage of living in Europe is that you can buy cheap tickets for Christmas and summer vacation and travel around. So, you don't necessarily have to go to the U.S. to come to Europe. You will also have a good life and a happy doctoral program.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:06.000
When studying for a doctoral program, I think it is much more important to find a good teacher and the right topic than the school rankings in Europe.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Because every school in Europe has its own specialties, if you only look at the rankings, you may miss out on the fact that there is a teacher here who has published a lot of good papers, and it happens to be your field.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Then, you need to develop your daily routine and habits. For example, my contract is that I don't even need to teach any books. I don't need to be a TA.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Sometimes I feel like I'm so free today, and I don't know what to do. But in fact, this flexibility is a good thing, but sometimes it makes you too lazy.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
In Europe, in addition to reading books, learning languages ​​is also a good hobby.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I'm done talking. I think it's about time. Thank you.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Thank you for sharing. We expect to open Q&A until about 10.50, and then we will start issuing digital participation certificates.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Because there are quite a few people today, so if you want to directly open the microphone to ask questions, please raise your hand first.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Or you can also type the question in the chat and I will pay attention to it.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:42.000
If you are still thinking about what questions to ask, when you are preparing for that question, I think you can ask Zhao Yuan to share again.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000
What is the difference between the United States and Europe when it comes to the field of science and technology?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Let me share my screen again.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I forgot to mention that if I talked too fast or if you have any personal questions that are not convenient to ask, you can contact me.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
My email is haiyongjiancornell. You can also scan the QR code and you can link with me.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Because the last speaker talked a little bit about stipends and contracts, I will talk about Germany first and then enter the United States.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
For example, because the speaker has already talked about it, I will talk faster.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It really depends on the boss. I think if you can get a contract, please get a contract.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You will get a visa, a work visa, not a student visa.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
The work visa means that you are the same as most employees.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
In principle, in Germany, it is a 20-30-day vacation.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
For our medical school, it is a 30-day vacation.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Your salary includes tax, pension and medical insurance.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Please remember that German medical insurance is very expensive.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So if you want to pay for it yourself, you will have to pay a lot of money from your own pocket.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And if you are already paying taxes, you have been paying for four years and you have just graduated.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Then I found out that you are looking for a job, whether it is a postdoc or a medical job, and then the school is over.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Because you have paid taxes before, and then there is a bit of unemployment in the middle.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
In fact, you will be paid a unemployment pension because you have no money.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And a lot of social benefits.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
In Germany, we are not the so-called tuition fee, we are usually the semester fee.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Then each class will have different rules, and then for our school, it is 290 euros.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
So if you don't have an economic assessment, I think Germany is a good choice.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Then we come to the difference between the United States and Germany.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
In the United States, it is a program system for each school program.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It has a fixed application deadline every year.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Suddenly it's winter, and then fall next year.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Then, in Germany, I just said that there are two systems.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There is no certain teacher-student system.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Then, if the program system, of course, there is an application deadline.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
However, each program has a different deadline.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
For example, Envelope and MPI know that they try not to squeeze together.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So they will miss each other.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Then in every institute of MPI, their Ph.D. program will not be unified.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You just saw that every institute is listed in various cities.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So this is what you have to check on the Internet.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And the application requirement is that you may need something.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000
As I mentioned earlier, in the United States, you don't have to have a master's degree.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But in Europe, most of them need a master's degree.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
In English exam, there is no so-called GRE in Germany.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It is mainly TOEFL and EAS.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Even if the time is more than two years, most of them can be accepted.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
In the United States, there is one more GRE.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Of course, I know that in recent years, many schools, and the better schools, have actually removed the GRE.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Because they think, or GMAT, if the social science is GMAT, they will think that this is not necessarily related to research.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
The resume is a must.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Here, CV is not a resume.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
The meaning of CV is that the academic resume is all of it.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Most of it has no page speed limit.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You can write it on anything related to academics.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
In the application document, this will be a little different.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Because the United States is still used to SOP, Statement of Purpose.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It is more important to see how your past experience will affect your next PhD, next career, next step.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
However, if it is in Germany, it is more like so-called lateral motivation.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because you have to think about one thing.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Because the PhD in Germany is relatively short.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It is three to four years.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
In addition, you already have a master's degree.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So you are very clear.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Including just now, it should be considered that you already know what your research direction goal is.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So you should talk about your past academic and where your goal is.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Because I had a background in the past, so I had to find this lab to do this kind of research.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But in the United States, you still have the so-called first-year course and lab rotation.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
So it cares more about your potential.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
What did you experience in the past?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
What will your future development be?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But you don't have to think too much now.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Because in principle, when you are applying for a document, a certain program will tell you.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
He hopes that this document will contain something.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Recommendation letter, then the United States must be three points can not run away.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
In Germany, it is two to three points, not necessarily.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Then there must be a score sheet.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's just that when you apply, you have to submit it or be accepted.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Then there is a very interesting one in Germany.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Because of the education system itself, they also want to provide a high school score sheet.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
So it's a bit of a hassle.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
But in order to submit a high school score sheet in English, it took me a little time.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Then the United States has almost no paper test.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Then in Germany, there are several.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
For example, Heidelberg needs to be interviewed.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Then the Ph.D. system, as I just mentioned, has the so-called teacher-student structure system.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I just talked about the cost.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
The cost is really a lot worse.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Because in the United States, there are some more conservative schools that may be free.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
For example, the German system is mostly free.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Up to $100.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But in principle, all the application fees here in Germany are free.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And you don't have to send your results from ETS.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
This money may be several years ago.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It may be higher now, I don't know.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
But you don't have to send this ETS score sheet in addition.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
But it's possible that he'll do it for you.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
He cares a lot about whether your transcript has been recognized.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
He usually tells you that there will be a uni-assistant in Germany.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And then he will ask you to sign up.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
It seems that there are some schools in the United States.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
But I didn't meet at all when I applied.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And then, do you need to submit a paper document?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I think it depends on the program.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And then I mentioned the stipend and salary part.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Germany has stipend and contract.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
In the United States, we actually quite agree.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Because you have to pay your own taxes later.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Like we're in the US right now.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
In the United States, you get that money.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You have to pay your own taxes every year.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But usually the school will give you your tuition.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And then you have to pay your own taxes.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And then it's actually called health insurance.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Health insurance has to pay for itself.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I think another great place is Europe.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
After you were invited, all your expenses.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I think it's a good thing.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
After you were invited, all your expenses.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
It turns out that my program was one week.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And then I was still studying in the United States.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
When I flew from New York to here, all my expenses.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Tickets and so on were covered.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I know that this is getting less and less in the United States.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Because they want to save a little more money.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And now Skype interview is very convenient.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
But the European system is still quite a lot.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
The program will still retain this.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I think this is quite important.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And then during your Ph.D.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
What will happen to you?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
In Germany, if you are a 15-year-old, you don't have to go to class at all.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
The program may be required to take a little class.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
That kind of class is not the so-called combined course.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It may be some scientific practice or something like that.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
There are some theoretical courses or something like that.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
But in the United States, it's his first year, second year.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's like your master, you still have to repair how many credits.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
In the United States, a lot of times you still have to do lab rotation.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So you may be in the second year before you decide your lab.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
But in Germany, in principle,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
You have to decide your boss when you interview.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And then are you qualified to take the exam?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
A lot of people in the United States are still qualified to take the exam.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But in Germany, you don't.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You are the professor who has been with people for three or four years.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And then a lot of programs in the United States require you to be a TA.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
If you don't want to be a TA,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
If you don't want to be a TA or just want to focus on research,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Germany will be more suitable for this.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The term of leave is quite different.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Because like I said, you need a master's degree to apply for a PhD in Germany.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
In general, his term of leave is relatively short.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And if you miss the lab rotation, course, etc.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Of course, you can focus on research and graduate earlier.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But in the United States, it will be a little longer.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Flexibility of the project

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Because I know a lot of American words, he's actually the boss.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I may not be discussing with him.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
But if you think about it, the so-called master's degree in Germany means

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Or it's like a job.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It's because of the grant project.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
He may want you to do that thing.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So your flexibility may be limited.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Work-life balance, Europe must be the best.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's just that you have so many annual leave.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
In the United States, there may not be.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And because the United States is longer.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And then Germany is relatively short.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So there's a higher chance that you may not have one when you graduate.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
This may also be something you have to think about.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
The main comparison is probably here.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And then maybe you can stop here.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And then if you have any questions, you can ask the two of us.
