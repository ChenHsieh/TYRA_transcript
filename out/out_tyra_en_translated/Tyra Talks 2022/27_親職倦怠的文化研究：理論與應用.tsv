4280	6720	Okay, thank you for the introduction, Ya-Hui.
6720	11600	And thank you all for coming to listen to my PhD thesis
11600	13000	or my research,
13000	15440	my research over the past few years.
15440	17840	Yes, I'm Gao Xian, Lin Gao Xian.
17840	21160	And I'm currently at the University of Belize
21160	22520	taking my PhD class.
22520	24840	And the topic I'm going to share with you today
24840	27200	is Occult Research in Parental Burnout,
27200	28880	Theory and Application.
28880	31560	It's a cultural research on parental burnout.
31560	35240	Okay, when I give a speech on this topic,
35240	37360	I usually ask my audience,
37360	38400	we can imagine,
38400	41520	or some of us may already have some youthful experience.
41520	46680	What do you think it would feel like to be a parent?
46680	48200	We'll probably spend some time,
48200	49560	probably a few seconds,
49560	50680	or even a minute,
50680	51640	to think about,
51640	52840	if you were a parent,
52840	55520	what kind of feeling would you usually feel?
55520	57600	Most of the audience,
57600	58720	or most parents,
58720	59320	would probably feel,
59320	62200	like it's shown in this picture,
62200	63600	we would feel that
63600	66760	parenthood is a place full of happiness,
66760	68480	full of excitement,
68480	71000	full of satisfaction.
71000	72600	When we see our kids, we think they're so cute.
72600	74720	We think they're very innocent,
74720	77560	very innocent.
77560	79960	But in the past few years,
79960	82320	when we were in our IQ test,
82320	85680	when we were actually interacting with our parents,
85680	87720	we started to realize that
87720	91240	some parents don't feel
91240	94880	that they have this kind of positive feeling.
94880	96920	Some parents would tell us that
96920	98720	they felt
98720	100880	they were filled with a strong sense of bondage,
100880	104360	as if they were crushed
104360	106440	by the role of being a parent.
106440	107800	They even told us that
107800	110360	they felt they couldn't do anything for their kids.
110360	112360	They could only do what they had to do.
112360	114160	They couldn't do anything else.
114160	115800	Some parents even felt
115800	117520	that they couldn't bear
117520	119480	the role of being a parent anymore.
119480	121800	Some parents even told us that
121800	123840	they felt they were no longer
123840	127560	the good parents they used to be.
127560	129600	In fact, this kind of testimony
129600	132560	or this kind of report
132560	133440	is too diverse.
133440	134800	We hear too often
134800	138880	that our parents report this kind of experience.
138880	140160	As researchers,
140160	141520	we really want to understand
141520	143800	why they have this kind of feeling.
143800	148600	So we started to try to define
148600	150600	what kind of phenomenon this is.
150600	152400	So, over the past few years,
152400	159520	our team has defined a new feeling
159520	161680	or a new symptom.
161680	163440	We call it a parental burnout
163440	166560	or a new concept of parental burnout.
166560	168160	This concept includes
168160	171040	the various symptoms
171040	173040	we just talked about,
173040	175560	including the feeling of
175560	177280	being in a parental role
177280	179840	or a sense of distance
179840	181120	between you and your kids.
181120	182920	It's an emotional distancing.
182920	185200	So, you can only do
185200	186240	what you have to do for them
186240	188560	and you can't do anything
188560	193360	for them emotionally.
193360	194800	You may even feel
194800	197240	that you are burdened
197240	201040	with the sense of responsibility
201040	202360	of being a parent.
202360	203600	Or you may even feel
203600	205200	that you have a different feeling
205200	206720	from the past.
206720	211160	It's a contrasting experience.
211160	212280	We know that
212280	214400	if there is a parental burnout,
214400	216000	if parental burnout
216000	218200	really exists
218200	219880	as our researchers say,
219880	221880	we may be curious
221880	224280	about the importance
224280	225640	of parental burnout.
225640	227560	Why do we need to care about it?
227560	228680	I can tell you
228680	229760	that in our past research,
229760	230960	we found that
230960	232480	parental burnout
232480	235080	has a serious impact
235080	236080	on our parents
236080	237000	and our kids.
237000	238680	It affects their mental and physical health.
238680	239840	For example,
239840	240800	we found that
240800	242640	parental burnout
242640	245200	strongly affects our parents.
245200	247120	Especially the parents
247120	248840	with parental burnout.
248840	250560	They are more likely
250560	251800	to want to escape
251800	253160	their current life
253160	256520	and their family life.
256520	258960	This kind of ideation
258960	260720	has a strong effect
260720	263960	on their suicide.
263960	265520	It's a very important
265520	267080	cause of mental and physical health.
267080	267960	On the other hand,
267960	270680	we often see that
270680	274120	parents with parental burnout
274120	275840	tend to be violent
275840	278200	to their kids
278200	280080	or ignore the needs
280080	281320	of their kids
282760	284800	and misbehave.
284800	286760	It's not surprising
286760	288080	that if our parents
288080	289880	have parental burnout,
289880	292360	their kids often have
292360	293400	depression
293400	294640	or anxiety
294640	298400	in their mental and physical health.
298400	299880	This is a very important issue.
299880	301360	As we mentioned,
301360	302880	it may affect
302880	303760	our parents
303760	305160	or our next generation's
305160	306560	mental and physical health.
306560	307320	On the other hand,
307320	308720	we wonder
308720	309840	who
309840	311840	has parental burnout
311840	314440	or this kind of feeling.
314440	316800	In our past research,
316840	318600	we collected
318600	320120	the data of parents in different countries.
320120	321720	We tried to estimate
321720	323720	which country
323720	325960	or which country's parents
325960	326800	are more likely
326800	328640	to have parental burnout.
328640	329600	We found something
329600	330520	very important.
330520	331560	We found that
331560	333240	in different parts of the world,
333240	335200	the prevalence rate
335200	336680	of parental burnout
336680	338800	is very different.
338800	340720	Especially in Western countries,
340720	342240	their parental burnout
342240	343760	is more likely
343760	345520	to happen
345520	346960	in Western countries.
346960	348280	Or they may have
348280	351200	parental burnout.
351200	353040	To be more specific,
353040	355520	this ratio
355520	357560	is even more than five times.
357560	358000	For example,
358000	359200	the picture on the left
359200	361520	is the prevalence rate
361520	363360	of parental burnout
363360	364480	we have estimated.
364480	365600	I don't know if you can see
365600	366600	my mouse.
366600	367600	Basically,
367600	369000	in this picture,
369000	370440	the darker the color,
370440	372480	it means
372480	373560	the more likely
374000	376040	the parental burnout is.
376040	376760	We can see that
376760	378240	in North America
378240	380160	or in European countries,
380160	381360	even in Russia,
381360	383000	the prevalence rate
383000	383920	of parental burnout is the highest.
383920	385400	Compared to non-Western countries,
385400	386880	the prevalence rate
386880	387960	of parental burnout
387960	390640	is basically lower.
390640	391960	In fact, the highest
391960	394880	may even be up to 8%.
394880	396480	Parents may be
396480	398200	suffering
398200	401280	from parental burnout
401320	404640	or mental illness.
404640	405760	Next,
405760	408400	we may want to
408400	410680	ask
410680	412120	why
412120	414720	parents in Western countries
414720	416680	or their parents
416680	418320	may suffer from parental burnout
418320	420280	so easily.
420280	423320	Are there any shared reasons
423320	426840	in these regions
426840	428160	that can help us understand
428160	429640	why they may suffer
429680	431280	from parental burnout?
431280	434920	To answer this question,
434920	436360	we conducted
436360	438240	a series of research.
438240	439760	We did a cultural research
439760	440400	to find out
440400	442760	what cultural factors
442760	445880	are shared by parents in Western countries
445880	446680	to make them
446680	449280	more likely to suffer from parental burnout.
449280	451880	Before we start
451880	453640	our research,
453640	456600	we may be curious about
456600	457560	what a cultural research
457560	458960	should do.
458960	459840	Obviously,
459840	461520	culture includes many concepts.
461520	463120	It includes ideas,
463120	464680	beliefs,
464680	466840	behaviors,
466840	468520	and traditions.
468520	469120	These things
469120	471720	are all part of our culture.
471720	473120	How can we
473120	475080	conduct a research
475080	476720	on such a complex issue?
476720	478600	Fortunately,
478600	481360	some research has shown us
481360	482840	that different cultures
482840	485160	have certain ways
485160	488040	to distinguish different cultural characteristics.
488640	491840	We call this
491840	494600	a pre-existing
494600	496120	theoretical framework.
496120	497800	As researchers,
497800	498720	if we are curious
498720	499840	about the cultural factors
499840	501000	that can explain
501000	502240	why parents
502240	504600	suffer from parental burnout,
504600	506080	we may be able to
506080	507720	use the theory structure
507720	510720	of cultural differences
510720	511880	in the past
511880	513760	to explain
513760	517560	whether these cultural factors
517560	518680	can predict
518680	519640	parental burnout.
519640	520640	This is a very intuitive
520640	522800	and simple research.
522800	523760	On the other hand,
523760	525280	we can imagine
525280	526120	that parental burnout
526120	531040	is a very specific phenomenon.
531040	533240	It occurs in
533240	535000	our parental environment.
535000	537240	We may doubt
537240	538440	that if we use
538440	541280	the general theoretical framework
541280	542160	to explain
542160	543680	parental burnout,
543680	545160	we may ignore
545160	546520	the important
546520	548680	cultural concept of parental burnout.
548680	550240	It may be that
550240	550840	we can predict
550840	551520	that parental burnout
551520	552640	is a very important concept
552640	553920	and we ignore it.
553920	554920	In order to make up
554920	556200	for this phenomenon,
556200	556960	in addition to using
556960	558360	a very simple
558360	559880	or straightforward
559880	562160	research trend like TopDown,
562160	563120	the bottom-up approach
563120	564560	is that we don't hold
564560	565840	any research assumptions.
565840	568400	We directly ask a research question
568400	569440	and collect data.
569440	570720	We directly
570720	572280	let our theoretical framework
572280	574280	appear in our data.
574280	575720	This research method
575720	576520	is very important.
576520	577640	We have to use this method
577640	578960	to explore
578960	581200	what kind of phenomenon
581200	582720	can help us understand
582720	585000	the cross-cultural difference
585000	586960	of parental burnout.
586960	588520	So, based on this point of view,
588520	589520	we basically use
589520	591920	these two sets of different
591920	594160	research trends.
594160	596000	We designed
596000	597520	six series of research.
597520	598560	In the first part,
598560	600960	we want to explore
600960	603000	the research question just mentioned.
603000	604120	Why is it that
604120	605120	the parents
605120	606360	with what kind of
606360	607560	shared causes
607560	608560	are more likely to
608560	609400	be affected by
609400	610840	parental burnout?
610840	612240	In addition to using
612240	613640	the TopDown Research Approach
613640	615720	to find these cultural causes,
615720	617160	we also want to understand
617160	618720	why these cultural causes
618720	621000	and these seemingly far-reaching concepts
621000	622880	can be connected
622880	625280	to the bottom-up approach
625280	626240	of parental burnout.
626240	627280	We want to explore
627280	629200	the mechanism
629200	631400	in the system.
631400	632720	We also use
632720	633640	the bottom-up approach
633640	635560	to find other cultural causes
635560	638120	and other possible explanations
638120	639480	as to why these cultural causes
639480	640120	can predict
640120	641680	the theoretical mechanism
641680	642800	of parental burnout.
642800	644720	We researchers
644720	646840	don't just want to
646840	648840	confine ourselves
648840	650360	in an academic ivory tower.
650360	652920	We also hope to provide
652920	655320	a theoretical framework
655320	656000	for our research
656000	657560	and the phenomena we create.
657560	658560	We also hope that
658560	660960	if it can help
660960	661880	our parents
661880	664520	when they are
664520	666360	at work,
666360	668400	or when they are
668400	669200	interacting with their parents,
669200	671240	we can help them.
671240	673640	So, for our theoretical framework,
673640	675080	we also try to
675080	676760	come up with a practical framework.
676760	678200	We try to find
678200	680480	if my theoretical framework
680480	682280	can help us find
682280	683920	some protective factors
683920	685680	that can protect our parents.
685680	686200	Okay.
686200	688320	Let's start
688320	690080	with my first series of research.
690080	692640	We use the top-down approach
692640	694000	to understand
694000	696440	the cultural differences
696440	697800	in parental burnout.
697800	699240	As I mentioned,
699240	700440	culture includes
700440	702840	many different concepts.
702840	703800	It includes ideas,
703800	704600	beliefs,
704600	705400	values,
705400	706840	and many other concepts.
706840	708560	Fortunately,
708560	710880	there are some
710880	711920	well-known
711920	713920	and robust
713920	714720	theoretical frameworks
714720	716600	that can help us
716600	718240	understand
718360	720320	the cultural differences
720320	722160	in different countries.
722160	723920	One of the most well-known
723920	726400	is Hofstede's Six Cultural Concepts.
726400	728280	It includes
728280	729560	the six factors.
729560	731320	Among the six factors,
731320	732720	we see
732720	734000	that individualism
734000	735080	or collativism
735080	736800	is a cultural concept.
736800	739920	It refers to
739920	740880	if a country
740880	741760	pays special attention to
741760	742720	individualism,
742720	744680	a cultural concept,
744680	747880	it will rely on
747880	749600	people who are close to it
749600	751040	rather than
751040	753160	other people.
753160	755760	It is a cultural value
755760	757560	that is prevalent in Western countries.
759640	762680	We can imagine
762680	764360	that
764360	765720	based on such a cultural structure,
765720	767840	we can imagine
767840	770360	that if Western countries
770360	772240	are prone to parental burnout,
772240	774160	will the
774160	775120	cultural value
775400	778360	that is prevalent in Western countries
778360	779760	explain
779760	782200	the cultural differences
782200	784520	in parental burnout?
784520	786520	In order to validate
786520	788080	our assumptions,
788080	789440	we collected
789440	791280	more than 10,000 parental data
791280	793280	across 42 countries.
793280	794800	We tried to explain
794800	795320	and answer
795320	798200	our research assumptions.
798200	798960	We basically
798960	800840	did a feedback analysis.
800840	802080	We can see
802080	803600	that when we control
803600	807640	various social demographic factors,
807640	810000	that is,
810000	814040	after the population changes,
814040	814920	we can see that
814920	818080	among the six cultural values,
818080	820400	only individualism
820400	821520	is particularly prevalent
821520	823680	in Western countries.
823680	824920	The cultural value
824920	826200	can predict
826200	827960	the prevalence of parental burnout
827960	830600	and its severity.
830600	831400	However,
831400	832240	we also talked about
832240	834400	the fact that
834400	835920	culture
835920	838240	has different aspects.
838240	840120	Individualism
840120	842120	is simply a Western value.
842120	843320	It also has
843320	844120	different aspects.
844120	847120	Some people
847120	848240	focus on themselves
848240	850520	because they want to improve themselves
850520	853680	and make better progress.
853680	856240	But why do some people
856240	858560	believe in individualism?
858560	860120	Maybe it's because
860120	863800	they don't believe in others
863800	865600	and don't care about others.
865600	866440	So we can imagine
866440	867960	that even if individualism
867960	870560	is a very
870560	873320	macro
873320	875960	or abstract concept,
875960	877640	it actually has different aspects
877640	880040	to explain
880040	881360	the cultural value.
881360	882800	So we have to use
882800	885880	a more detailed cultural structure
885880	886720	to explain
886720	888560	what aspects
889320	891520	of individualism
891520	892240	can explain
892240	893560	the cultural value.
893560	895240	So we try to use
895240	897760	a different model.
897760	899080	In this model,
899080	900720	we can see that
900720	902760	individualism,
902760	905080	which is a country
905080	906640	that emphasizes individualism,
906640	908160	individual individuals,
908160	910840	may have
910840	913560	different aspects.
913560	914640	For example,
914640	916080	they may want to
916080	917680	cultivate themselves
917680	919680	or they may
919680	922120	want to enjoy themselves more.
922120	924840	They may not care about others
924840	925920	or
925920	927360	they may not
927360	928000	do anything
928000	929520	that benefits others.
929520	932040	Or they may not
932040	935200	follow their traditions
935200	937400	or others.
937400	939440	We use
939440	940960	a more detailed
940960	942640	theoretical structure
942640	943880	to see
943880	945320	which aspect
945320	946800	of individualism
946840	948920	can explain
948920	951560	the cultural value.
951560	952800	In order to explain this,
952800	953640	in order to answer
953640	955880	our research questions,
955880	956800	we gathered
956800	959360	more than 600 parents in Poland.
959360	960800	We tried to use
960800	962560	the same research method
962560	964360	to run a return analysis.
964360	965360	We can see that
965360	966200	basically,
966200	968320	after we control
970440	972320	all the population changes,
972600	977320	in all the 10 cultural values,
977320	981360	only individualism
981360	983520	emphasizes personal achievement
983520	987240	and personal ownership
987240	988800	and power.
988800	991040	It doesn't want to
991040	994520	do anything that benefits others.
994520	995480	It can explain
995480	997840	more of our family values.
997840	998800	At this time,
998800	1001760	we can think about
1001840	1003320	how to use
1003320	1005240	a more detailed theoretical structure.
1005240	1006640	We can see that
1006640	1010120	in this abstract cultural value,
1010120	1013200	in this cultural value of individualism,
1013200	1014600	some more detailed aspects,
1014600	1016000	achievement, power,
1016000	1017240	and less cultural value
1017240	1019520	that benefits others,
1019520	1021560	it can predict our family values.
1021560	1022960	Now, we can think about
1022960	1025240	what kind of people
1025240	1025960	will show
1025960	1028480	this value trend.
1028480	1029480	Now,
1029480	1031480	you can think about
1031480	1033280	what kind of people
1033280	1036840	will have this value trend.
1036840	1038480	In fact, in past research,
1038480	1040120	it has been told to us
1040120	1041480	that
1042080	1045160	those who need to be perfect
1045160	1048680	and focus on making mistakes
1048680	1051240	are the perfect individuals.
1051240	1053200	It's easy for them to show
1053200	1055280	that they enjoy achievement,
1055280	1057440	power,
1057440	1059960	and less perfection
1060000	1062480	and become perfect individuals.
1062480	1064720	It's easy for them to show
1064720	1067200	this kind of value trend.
1067200	1069520	So, we can imagine
1069520	1070840	from the research just now,
1070840	1072680	we can see that
1072680	1076120	in different aspects of individualism,
1076120	1077800	perfectionism may be
1077800	1080080	a very important factor
1080080	1082360	to predict our family values.
1082360	1084360	We can also infer that
1084360	1087000	perhaps in the family environment,
1087000	1089800	the parents who emphasize perfectionism
1089800	1093520	are particularly likely to be affected by family ties.
1093520	1095640	But we may be curious
1095640	1096720	that the emphasis on perfectionism
1096720	1099360	in the family environment
1099360	1100800	is actually similar to
1100800	1103560	our personality.
1103560	1105280	It's a feeling
1105280	1106240	that we may feel
1106240	1107320	in the family
1107320	1110000	with our family ties.
1110000	1112320	These two concepts
1112320	1114080	are very different.
1114080	1116120	Why are they connected?
1116120	1118400	So, we can think about
1118680	1121360	the mechanism
1121360	1122320	of perfectionism.
1122320	1123240	We want to know
1123240	1125920	what kind of internal mechanism
1125920	1129680	can explain these two very different concepts.
1129680	1133160	So, let's think again.
1133160	1135440	In our family environment
1135440	1138440	or in the environment where we raise children,
1138440	1140000	what kind of situation is it?
1140000	1143200	It's actually a very dynamic
1143200	1144840	and chaotic situation.
1144840	1146880	Sometimes, children may cry.
1146880	1147760	But when they cry,
1147760	1149600	there is no special reason.
1149600	1151440	At this time, if our parents
1151440	1152480	may naturally
1152480	1154520	express their negative emotions,
1154520	1155600	we can imagine
1155600	1158720	that the dynamic environment of this family
1158720	1161520	will gradually become a vicious cycle.
1161520	1164560	There will be more and more negative emotions in it.
1164560	1167880	At this time, if we want to solve
1167880	1169440	such a negative cycle quickly,
1169440	1172040	we may have to adopt
1172040	1174360	some highly efficient
1175760	1177280	emotional adjustment strategies.
1177280	1179040	Our parents may adopt
1179040	1181520	such an emotional control.
1181520	1184560	They must control their negative emotions
1184560	1187120	and not show it to their children.
1187120	1188920	This kind of emotional adjustment.
1188920	1191320	We can also imagine that
1191320	1192720	especially those parents
1192720	1195800	who particularly emphasize that they need to be perfect,
1195800	1197720	they will particularly want to adopt
1197720	1200800	such an emotional adjustment
1200800	1202560	to control each other's emotions.
1202560	1204040	So, we can assume
1204040	1206880	why our parenting professionalism
1207320	1209120	emphasizes perfectionism
1209120	1211680	in the family environment.
1211680	1214360	It is related to parenting.
1214360	1216120	Maybe it's because such a characteristic
1216120	1218800	will make it easier for our parents
1221120	1222880	to control their emotions
1222880	1225480	and not show it to their children.
1225480	1226680	This kind of suppression
1226680	1227960	or expressive suppression
1227960	1230280	is an emotional adjustment strategy.
1230280	1231560	In order to solve this problem,
1231560	1232360	in order to respond to
1232360	1234160	such a research hypothesis,
1234160	1236280	we have collected
1236280	1240000	more than 400 parents in Poland.
1240000	1241440	We can see that
1241440	1244040	the more our parents emphasize
1244040	1248520	that they want to be perfect,
1248520	1250000	the easier it will be for them
1250000	1252440	to adopt such an emotional adjustment strategy
1252440	1254160	to further affect
1254160	1256440	their children.
1258080	1261400	So, in conclusion,
1261400	1263520	we can see that
1263520	1265440	using the top-down research approach,
1265440	1268480	using the existing cultural structure,
1268480	1269920	we can see that
1269920	1270560	in the West,
1270560	1271720	Western parents
1271720	1273040	are particularly prone to
1273040	1274120	the influence of parental suppression.
1274120	1277280	This is especially related to their personalism.
1277280	1278880	More specifically,
1278880	1281720	it is related to their perfectionism.
1281720	1283800	So, why is such a cultural value
1283800	1286120	related to parental suppression?
1286120	1288760	Maybe it's because
1288760	1289960	such a cultural value
1289960	1295720	allows them to use more emotional control
1295720	1297640	and more suppression.
1297640	1299640	That's why
1299640	1301760	such a personalist effect is produced.
1301760	1305280	As I mentioned at the beginning,
1305280	1306800	in fact, culture
1306800	1308320	includes different levels.
1308320	1310920	We should not only use
1310920	1312760	the top-down research approach.
1312760	1314600	We should also use
1314600	1318800	the approach that is closer to the parents' environment.
1318800	1321000	We should visit our parents.
1321000	1323680	We should keep a fixed research question.
1323680	1325440	We should collect our data
1325440	1327520	and not make any research assumptions.
1327520	1328560	We should directly see
1328560	1331720	if there are any neglected changes
1331720	1333680	that can actually help us understand
1333680	1336240	the cultural difference of parental suppression.
1336240	1339160	So, with this in mind,
1339160	1341080	we also carried out our third research,
1341080	1342920	a bottom-up research approach.
1342920	1345400	We try to take such a research strategy
1345400	1347520	to see if there are any differences
1347520	1348920	in parental culture
1348920	1351360	or if there are any cultural factors
1351360	1353440	that are particularly prevalent in the West
1353440	1356480	that can explain parental parental suppression.
1357840	1359200	Okay.
1359200	1360840	In order to answer this question,
1360840	1362000	as we just said,
1362000	1363400	we have to immediately
1365040	1368280	raise a research question
1368280	1369680	and collect the data
1369680	1371880	without making any research assumptions.
1371880	1373920	So, the question we raise here
1373920	1375240	might be,
1375240	1378680	what is the culture of parenting in Western countries?
1378680	1380680	What characteristics
1380680	1385320	can describe Western parenting culture?
1385320	1386680	To answer this question,
1386680	1388560	we might be able to directly think about
1388560	1390920	what kind of parenting culture
1390920	1393920	and how to collect such data.
1393920	1395040	We can imagine that
1395040	1397040	in fact, in different parenting cultures,
1397040	1400440	there will be a very specific model performance.
1400440	1402520	We can imagine that some parents
1402520	1404680	may fantasize that
1405040	1407120	what kind of good parents
1407120	1411160	they imagine in their mind.
1411160	1413240	The good parents in their mind
1413240	1415120	may be able to show
1415120	1419280	the characteristics of different parenting cultures.
1419280	1422800	So, we directly ask the parents.
1422800	1424800	We directly visit
1424800	1429080	the thousands of mothers and fathers
1429080	1431000	across 37 different countries.
1431000	1432440	We ask them,
1432440	1433720	in your mind,
1433720	1436480	if you can only use five characteristics
1436480	1439480	to describe the good...
1439480	1444280	model father and model mother in your mind,
1444280	1447800	how would you describe their characteristics?
1447800	1450320	I will pause for about a minute.
1450320	1452400	Although there are only five of us,
1452400	1453800	we can imagine that
1453800	1456600	if you are a parent,
1456600	1457520	you are already a parent,
1457520	1459400	or you are not a parent yet,
1459400	1460760	you can imagine
1460800	1464200	that if we want to describe a model parent,
1464200	1466440	you only use five characteristics to describe them,
1466440	1468440	how would you describe them?
1468440	1470120	Yes, I will pause for a minute.
1470120	1471880	If you have any questions at this time,
1471880	1472880	you can also ask.
1472880	1473720	Okay.
1490440	1491280	Okay.
1491280	1494200	You may already have some ideas in your mind.
1494200	1499200	I will tell you what we saw in our research.
1499480	1501000	We found that
1501000	1502600	in Western countries,
1502600	1505480	they do have a very special pattern.
1505480	1508080	Their good parents...
1508080	1509640	They do have a fixed idea
1509640	1513000	about good parents.
1513000	1514280	We did find that,
1514280	1517000	especially in some Western countries
1517000	1518080	that speak English,
1518080	1519720	including the United States,
1519720	1520560	Canada,
1521760	1523000	Australia,
1523000	1523840	the UK,
1523840	1525000	and European countries,
1525000	1526880	and even Russia,
1526880	1528680	and some countries that speak French,
1528680	1530520	they particularly emphasize
1530520	1533080	that when they describe those model parents,
1533080	1535400	they emphasize
1535400	1537200	that they need to show love,
1537200	1539720	that they need to show patience,
1539720	1542080	that they need to pay attention,
1542080	1544200	that they need to listen to their children.
1544200	1546440	These are different characteristics.
1546440	1548840	What do these characteristics show?
1548840	1550080	They show that
1550080	1553480	in these different Western cultures,
1553480	1555920	what they emphasize is
1555920	1557600	to show positive emotions
1557600	1559480	and to control negative emotions.
1559560	1561760	This is a characteristic.
1561760	1563880	In the past, research has shown
1563880	1567000	that this type of education
1567000	1571200	is actually a so-called positive education.
1571200	1574320	Positive education refers to
1574320	1575640	showing positive emotions
1575640	1578520	and controlling negative emotions.
1578520	1580160	So, from this research,
1580160	1581320	we can see that
1584920	1586880	using this pattern approach,
1586880	1589000	we can see that Western education
1589000	1592360	emphasizes emotional performance.
1592360	1593840	This emotional performance
1593840	1595160	is to show positive emotions
1595160	1597040	and control negative emotions.
1597040	1597800	At this time,
1597800	1600480	we may want to ask a question.
1600480	1602360	Why does such a
1602360	1604760	seemingly beautiful thing
1604760	1606120	show positive emotions
1606120	1607080	and control negative emotions?
1607080	1608520	This kind of education strategy
1608520	1611160	may be related to
1611160	1612880	the parent-child relationship.
1612880	1615400	So, after our research,
1615400	1617360	we further asked
1617360	1621320	if there is a mechanism
1621320	1623400	to explain this.
1623400	1625560	We can imagine that
1625560	1627080	positive parenting
1627080	1629320	or showing positive emotions
1629320	1630400	and controlling negative emotions
1630400	1633440	is a form of emotional performance.
1633440	1634840	When our parents
1634840	1638120	have this model image of their parents,
1638120	1640120	what do they need to do?
1640120	1641680	Basically,
1641680	1642560	they feel that
1642560	1645720	in the process of raising children,
1645760	1648280	they need to control themselves
1648280	1652120	and achieve this emotional performance strategy.
1652120	1654600	They need to tell themselves
1654600	1656440	that they need to show positive emotions
1656440	1658640	and control negative emotions.
1658640	1659600	To a certain extent,
1659600	1661840	it is an emotional performance strategy.
1661840	1663800	When an emotional performance strategy occurs,
1663800	1666560	when there is such an emotional performance strategy,
1666560	1670160	our parents may have to act.
1670160	1673760	When they are not happy,
1673760	1676360	when they have a lot of negative emotions,
1676360	1678200	they have to try to
1678200	1680000	put a smile on their face
1680000	1683360	in front of their children.
1683360	1686560	They have to make their appearance
1686560	1689760	in line with this emotional performance strategy.
1689760	1690360	On the other hand,
1690360	1691760	some parents may
1691760	1693560	try to use different methods
1693560	1694600	to make themselves
1694600	1696560	look unhappy
1696560	1699120	from the moment
1699120	1702480	to find some happy feelings.
1702480	1703960	Whether it is
1703960	1705760	simply controlling your appearance
1705760	1708680	or simply changing
1708680	1710400	your inner feelings,
1710400	1711760	these different emotions
1711760	1713240	are actually a kind of acting
1713240	1714560	to a certain extent.
1714560	1715920	They are all trying to
1715920	1717360	show and perform
1717360	1718840	a positive education strategy
1718840	1721280	in front of our children.
1721280	1723640	We can also easily imagine
1723640	1728360	that this set of emotional labor
1728360	1730960	or emotional performance
1730960	1732320	is actually very demanding.
1732320	1735480	We have to constantly monitor
1735480	1736640	whether our emotions
1736640	1738560	really fit
1738560	1740440	this set of emotional adjustment strategies.
1740440	1744760	So it requires us to put in effort
1744760	1747440	and put in our
1747440	1748920	cognitive ability.
1748920	1752120	Of course, as time goes by,
1752120	1753640	the more effort you put in,
1753640	1756440	the more pressure you may feel.
1756440	1758760	It's not that surprising
1758760	1759360	that some parents
1759360	1761520	may have burnout.
1761520	1762680	So this is a theoretical framework
1762680	1763600	that we came up with.
1763600	1765240	Why does positive parenting
1765240	1766880	have something to do
1766880	1768600	with the fact
1768600	1770080	that our children are in this situation?
1770080	1773000	We need to figure out
1773000	1774160	how we can do this.
1774160	1777800	We collected 347
1777800	1778640	parents' data.
1778640	1779800	We looked at
1779800	1781600	whether the theoretical framework
1781600	1783200	we came up with is true.
1783200	1785480	We saw that
1785480	1787160	the more parents
1787160	1789560	understand our environment,
1789560	1792760	the more they adopt
1792760	1795120	positive parenting strategies.
1795120	1797360	Positive parenting
1797360	1799640	emotional performance strategies.
1799640	1801320	The more they adopt
1801320	1802360	surface acting
1802360	1804160	or deep acting
1804160	1806760	emotional performance
1806760	1808200	emotional adjustment strategies,
1808200	1810840	the more cognitive resources
1810840	1812080	these parents use
1812080	1813880	to make it easier for them
1813880	1816920	to be affected by burnout.
1816920	1820240	We also saw in our statistical analysis
1820240	1822160	that this model
1822160	1825560	is a great way to explain
1825560	1828000	the data in our data.
1830120	1831320	It's a great way to explain
1831320	1833480	the results of our data.
1834800	1835760	Okay.
1835760	1836520	Basically,
1836520	1838920	based on all the research
1838920	1840560	we've done so far,
1840560	1842280	from a top-down research approach,
1842280	1843520	we can see that
1843520	1844880	this cultural strategy,
1844920	1846840	this cultural value
1846840	1847880	of individualism
1847880	1849800	and this cultural value
1849800	1850760	of perfectionism
1850760	1851640	will allow our parents
1851640	1853920	to use a lot of
1853920	1855960	emotional adjustment
1855960	1858760	to further predict their burnout.
1858760	1860400	From a bottom-up approach,
1860400	1862160	we can see that
1862160	1863240	if we want to describe
1863240	1865040	Western culture,
1865040	1866360	positive parenting,
1866360	1868640	especially their emotional
1868640	1871240	positive parenting,
1871240	1872080	they have to
1872080	1873520	show a lot of positive emotions.
1873520	1874960	They have to control their emotions.
1874960	1876520	Positive parenting
1876520	1879480	will make our parents
1879480	1881920	have to act emotionally
1881920	1884680	in front of their children
1884680	1887240	to explain their burnout.
1887240	1888600	Combining these two aspects of research,
1888600	1889720	we can see
1889720	1891160	why this culture
1891160	1891960	will make parents
1891960	1893880	more likely to be affected by burnout.
1893880	1894560	To a certain extent,
1894560	1895600	it's because
1895600	1897240	they've adopted
1897240	1899040	very powerful emotional adjustment.
1899040	1901120	They've adopted a lot of
1901120	1902120	willful emotions
1902160	1903560	in front of their children
1903560	1904720	or they've adopted
1904720	1905840	a powerful emotional adjustment
1905840	1908360	to act in front of their children.
1908360	1910080	At this time,
1910080	1912080	as we said at the beginning,
1912080	1913040	as researchers,
1913040	1916160	we don't just want to stay
1916160	1917960	in the theoretical framework.
1917960	1919600	We also hope that
1919600	1920840	the theoretical framework
1920840	1922160	will be helpful
1922160	1923200	to our parents
1923200	1925240	and will be helpful
1925240	1927680	to our food environment.
1927680	1930400	So, for our theoretical framework,
1930400	1931760	we also try to find
1931760	1932440	ways to protect our children.
1932440	1935320	We try to think from another perspective
1935320	1937360	on how to help our parents.
1937360	1939160	First of all, we just mentioned
1939160	1940680	why Western culture
1940680	1941440	will make parents
1941440	1943120	more likely to be affected by burnout.
1943120	1944640	It's because they've adopted
1944640	1945920	more powerful
1945920	1947880	emotional adjustment strategies.
1947880	1949680	At this time, we want to say
1949680	1952360	if we can stop this thing,
1952360	1953840	we can prevent our parents
1953840	1955520	from adopting so many
1955520	1961360	negative emotional adjustments,
1961360	1963680	will our parents be protected?
1963680	1965760	From another perspective,
1965760	1968040	if our parents
1968040	1970360	can control their emotions
1970360	1974480	more efficiently and intelligently,
1974480	1976560	will their risk of
1976560	1977640	child abuse
1977640	1979800	be lower?
1979800	1981360	Based on this study,
1981360	1984480	we did our first study.
1984480	1986240	We did our first study.
1986240	1987520	We want to see
1987520	1988440	if our parents
1988440	1990720	really have a better ability
1990720	1993200	to control their emotions,
1993200	1994360	will their risk of child abuse
1994360	1996760	be lower?
1996760	1998720	Based on this study,
1998720	2000080	we measured
2000080	2002080	the emotional intelligence of parents,
2002080	2004560	which is their ability to
2004560	2006440	identify,
2006440	2007520	to express,
2007520	2008440	to understand,
2008440	2009320	and to adjust
2009320	2010360	and use their emotions.
2010360	2011600	We want to see
2011600	2012840	if this ability
2012840	2014320	is related to
2014320	2015680	child abuse.
2015680	2017960	We collected data from different countries.
2017960	2019600	We collected data from Belgium.
2019600	2021520	We found that
2021520	2024200	regardless of which measurement
2024200	2026160	we used,
2026160	2028160	regardless of which measurement
2028160	2030160	we used,
2030160	2033160	if our parents
2033160	2035520	can use their emotions
2035520	2037520	more intelligently,
2037520	2038880	their risk of child abuse
2038880	2040720	will be lower.
2040720	2042600	Our emotional intelligence
2042600	2044560	can predict the risk of
2044560	2045800	child abuse
2045800	2047600	for our parents.
2047600	2050360	Indeed,
2050360	2052680	if our parents have better emotional intelligence,
2052680	2054000	we can protect them
2054000	2057360	from the risk of child abuse.
2057360	2058160	However,
2058160	2059040	as we mentioned,
2059040	2061520	we can see from the definition
2061520	2062560	that emotional intelligence
2062560	2063880	can include...
2063880	2065000	We just mentioned
2065000	2067000	that it's related to
2067000	2068280	identification,
2068280	2069320	expression,
2069320	2071800	understanding,
2071800	2074160	and using emotions.
2074160	2075920	It can be someone else's emotions
2075920	2077440	or our own emotions.
2077440	2078880	It can also be
2078880	2081240	intrapersonal
2081240	2082640	or interpersonal.
2082640	2084480	Intrapersonal
2084480	2087160	refers to a person
2087160	2088840	who can
2088840	2090360	identify,
2090360	2091040	express,
2091040	2091720	understand,
2091720	2092720	and adjust
2092720	2093960	their own emotions.
2093960	2096480	It can also be intrapersonal.
2096480	2099480	It can identify,
2099480	2099920	express,
2099920	2101160	or understand
2101160	2102760	other people's emotions.
2102760	2105760	We want to ask
2105760	2109360	if emotional intelligence
2109360	2111440	can be classified
2111440	2113240	as intrapersonal
2113240	2114320	or interpersonal,
2114320	2115840	will it have the same effect
2115840	2117920	on child abuse?
2117920	2120080	First of all,
2120080	2120800	we collected...
2120800	2123200	We used
2123200	2125480	a different set of data.
2125480	2127280	We collected data
2127280	2128760	on parents
2128760	2130440	and children.
2130440	2131680	We found that
2131680	2133400	if we only focus
2133400	2135600	on
2135600	2137160	parents
2137160	2139560	who have
2139560	2141880	better emotional intelligence,
2141880	2143120	their child abuse,
2143120	2144960	regardless of the country,
2144960	2145840	we can see that
2145840	2147440	this set of abilities
2147440	2149600	can greatly reduce
2149600	2151640	the chance of child abuse.
2151640	2152640	However,
2152640	2154480	if we only focus on
2154480	2155960	controlling,
2155960	2156880	understanding,
2156880	2158600	and identifying other people's emotions,
2158600	2160640	this intrapersonal competence
2160640	2163720	affects our child abuse
2163760	2166120	not only in proportion,
2166120	2167160	but also in proportion.
2167160	2168440	We can see that
2168440	2170400	it basically predicts
2170400	2172080	the effect of child abuse.
2172080	2172840	In other words,
2172840	2175720	from a humanistic perspective,
2175720	2176920	in a humanistic language,
2176920	2179320	it basically means
2179320	2180400	understanding other people's emotions
2180400	2182000	or using other people's emotions
2182000	2183720	to do something related to others.
2183720	2185000	This kind of emotional intelligence
2185000	2187480	will put parents
2187480	2189240	in danger.
2189240	2192320	So we came to a conclusion.
2192320	2193880	Interpersonal emotional intelligence
2193880	2197120	not only has less positive effects,
2197120	2199280	it may even
2199280	2200240	put parents
2200240	2202920	in more danger of child abuse.
2204320	2205200	So,
2205200	2206840	based on this study,
2206840	2208880	to a certain extent,
2208880	2209960	we can say that
2209960	2212240	if we can
2212240	2214760	help parents
2214760	2216160	to control their emotions
2216160	2218240	and understand their emotions better,
2218240	2220520	their child abuse will be less.
2220520	2221400	However,
2221400	2222720	based on the second study,
2222720	2223800	we actually need to
2223800	2226440	further refine this study.
2226440	2228000	Basically,
2228000	2229800	only when parents
2229800	2231080	are controlling
2231080	2233120	their own emotions,
2233120	2234960	their child abuse will be reduced.
2234960	2237440	If we control other people's emotions,
2237440	2239000	they may be more
2239000	2241160	affected by child abuse.
2241160	2241840	So, in fact,
2241840	2243880	doing research is a bit like this.
2243880	2246440	We will always look at
2247240	2248120	different aspects more carefully.
2248120	2249840	We may get different results.
2250800	2252000	This is the first
2252000	2253760	study conclusion we got.
2253760	2255080	It actually brings
2255080	2256440	a very important conclusion.
2256440	2257720	If parents
2257720	2259440	have better emotional intelligence,
2259440	2260480	their child abuse
2260480	2261880	will be less.
2261880	2264160	In fact, the good news is
2264160	2265280	that in our past studies,
2265280	2266800	we have seen that
2266800	2267600	as long as we spend
2267600	2269680	15 hours,
2269680	2272640	we can teach
2272640	2273600	an individual
2273600	2276200	how to learn
2277240	2279520	and control our emotions
2279560	2280880	or how to
2280880	2281960	identify our emotions
2281960	2283360	in a good way.
2284440	2285360	From another perspective,
2285360	2288960	we also care about
2288960	2290840	individual's own ability
2290840	2292560	and emotional intelligence.
2292560	2294240	In fact, we are also curious
2294240	2295360	if we can start from
2295360	2297480	the interaction between people
2297480	2298920	and the interaction between people
2298920	2299680	to find some
2299680	2301680	protective factors
2301680	2303080	that can help parents.
2303080	2304320	In fact, this perspective
2304320	2304840	also comes from
2304840	2306560	the research we just started.
2306560	2307720	We see that
2307720	2310200	the individual's
2310200	2313600	individualism
2313600	2315280	actually puts parents
2315280	2317000	at risk of child abuse.
2317000	2318280	We just mentioned
2318280	2319560	what individualism is.
2319560	2321040	Individualism refers to
2321040	2323040	a person who is very focused on
2324520	2325520	relying on himself.
2325520	2327640	He is less dependent on other people's help.
2327640	2328960	This kind of ability
2328960	2330880	and this kind of cultural value.
2330880	2332680	In fact, from another perspective,
2332680	2334120	if our parents
2334120	2336880	can rely on others better,
2336920	2339000	if they can get
2339000	2340360	the resources from others better,
2340360	2341280	that is, if they have better
2341280	2342600	social support,
2342600	2344640	the chances of child abuse
2344640	2346720	will be less.
2346720	2348280	So we also proposed this assumption.
2348280	2349920	If parents have better
2349920	2351200	social support,
2351200	2352400	the chances of child abuse
2352400	2354400	will be lower.
2354400	2356160	So to answer this question,
2356160	2359120	we collected data from
2359120	2362760	different countries,
2362760	2363320	whether they are
2363320	2364680	individualist countries
2364680	2366520	or non-individualist countries.
2366520	2368040	We collected data from Turkey.
2368040	2371240	We collected data from Peru.
2371240	2374600	We collected data from Poland and Belgium.
2374600	2375840	We collected data from
2375840	2377320	any country.
2377320	2378240	We can see that
2378240	2380720	in the results of the return analysis,
2380720	2382240	we controlled all
2384240	2385720	the data on population changes.
2385720	2386800	We found that
2386800	2389280	our parents' social support
2389280	2391440	is indeed one of the most important
2391440	2393640	protective measures
2393640	2395920	to protect our parents
2395920	2398480	from child abuse.
2398480	2400000	So from this result,
2400000	2401040	we actually learned
2401040	2402840	another thing.
2402840	2403880	In fact, as long as we can
2403880	2406000	let our parents understand
2406000	2407400	that when they are
2407400	2408600	taking care of their children,
2408600	2409880	when they are interacting
2409880	2411480	with their children,
2411480	2413560	they are not alone.
2413560	2415120	In fact, if they can
2415120	2416840	get resources from their environment,
2416840	2418800	our parents can
2418800	2422200	avoid the risk of
2422200	2423160	being abducted
2423160	2425480	and abducted.
2425480	2428800	So basically, this is a very important
2428800	2430320	second protective factor that we saw.
2430320	2433160	At the end, I want to sum up
2433160	2435200	the different studies
2435200	2436680	I talked about today
2436680	2438040	to make a conclusion.
2438040	2440280	In fact, through these six
2440280	2441480	series of studies,
2441480	2443160	what information did we get?
2443160	2444760	The first message we got was
2444760	2445680	that Western culture
2445680	2447320	does put parents
2447320	2448960	at risk of child abduction.
2448960	2451400	We saw from the top-down approach
2451400	2452520	that Western individualism,
2452520	2454320	especially their perfectionism,
2454320	2455400	will make parents
2455400	2459040	take more suppression,
2459040	2463080	emotional adjustment.
2463080	2464440	On the other hand,
2464440	2465360	we can see from the bottom-up
2465360	2467240	research approach
2467240	2468360	that what can show
2468360	2469600	Western parenting
2469600	2470800	is positive education,
2470800	2472640	especially positive emotions,
2472640	2473560	controlling each other's emotions,
2473560	2475360	such a positive parenting strategy.
2475360	2476440	It will make our parents
2476440	2478040	feel like they have to
2478040	2480000	act in front of their children,
2480000	2482440	especially in terms of emotions.
2482440	2485400	No matter what kind of emotional adjustment,
2485400	2487200	suppression or emotional labor,
2487200	2489400	they are all very powerful.
2489400	2491320	These powerful emotional adjustments
2491320	2492920	will naturally make parents
2492920	2494080	more likely to be affected
2494080	2496480	by child abduction.
2496480	2500000	Through this theoretical framework,
2500000	2502600	we also try to understand
2502600	2503600	another thing.
2503600	2504560	Indeed, Western culture
2504560	2505880	will make our parents
2505880	2507880	more likely to be affected by child abduction,
2507880	2509640	but our environment...
2509640	2511040	But from another perspective,
2511040	2512560	if we can teach our parents
2512560	2515480	how to better interact
2515480	2520560	with their emotions,
2520560	2521920	or if we can find ways
2521920	2523040	to get more social support
2523040	2524840	from our parents,
2524840	2526520	it can actually protect our parents
2526520	2529640	from being affected by child abduction.
2529640	2532560	These are the two most important
2532560	2535160	take-home messages
2535160	2536600	in my speech today.
2536600	2539040	Today, I basically
2539040	2540480	summarized my research
2540480	2541440	over the past two years
2541440	2543960	in a very quick overview.
2543960	2545440	I listed the eight articles
2545440	2547880	that we published in the past,
2547880	2549560	which is the main
2551440	2553520	take-home message I reported today.
2553520	2554560	You can see that
2554560	2556960	our lab and I
2556960	2558960	put our past articles
2558960	2562240	on our lab website.
2562240	2563360	If you are interested
2563360	2565120	in learning more about the details,
2565120	2566720	especially in today's speech,
2566720	2568720	I didn't...
2568720	2570480	I didn't go into the details of statistics
2570480	2572640	or analysis.
2572640	2574480	If you are interested
2574480	2575600	in the details,
2575600	2577960	you can read these articles
2577960	2579960	directly.
2579960	2580520	Okay.
2580520	2582480	In the end,
2582480	2583920	we have to talk about
2583920	2586320	some guidelines in all our research.
2586320	2588440	As I said in my speech today,
2588440	2590320	it's like I'm the only one
2590320	2591960	doing all this research.
2591960	2592960	But it's not like that.
2592960	2593560	All the research
2593560	2596320	is a joint effort
2596320	2597920	for all of us.
2597920	2600720	So, I have to say thank you.
2600720	2601280	First of all,
2601280	2603080	of course, my two professors
2603080	2604960	and my long-term
2604960	2606240	partners.
2606240	2607800	The most important thing is
2607800	2610720	that we have hundreds of
2610720	2612800	researchers all over the world.
2612800	2614000	We are also
2614000	2615960	doing research on
2615960	2617000	the concept of parent-child bondage
2617000	2618880	and trying to find ways
2618880	2621080	to help our parents.
2621080	2622920	So, we have to thank
2622920	2624480	all the partners
2624480	2626680	and researchers
2626680	2628000	who have worked together.
2628000	2629200	Lastly,
2629200	2631120	as we have been talking about
2631120	2631960	in the research,
2631960	2633120	some parents
2633120	2634600	are already very bondage.
2634600	2636840	They may have
2636840	2639160	been affected by parent-child bondage.
2639160	2640520	But they still
2640520	2642600	spend their precious time
2642600	2644560	to help us fill in
2644560	2645480	these questions
2645480	2647920	or help us complete our research.
2647920	2649480	So, we have to thank
2649480	2652080	our parents
2652080	2653200	especially parents
2653200	2654600	from different countries
2654600	2657040	who have done so much for us.
2657040	2657600	Okay.
2657600	2659640	So, this is a quick overview
2659640	2661360	of my presentation today.
2661360	2663600	It took me about 45 minutes in total.
2663600	2666480	So, I have about
2666480	2668000	10 to 15 minutes left.
2668000	2669320	If you have any questions,
2669320	2671360	we can discuss them together.
2671360	2673080	Thank you, Ya Hui.
2673080	2674080	Thank you, Gao Xian.
2674080	2675920	On behalf of the audience,
2675920	2678800	I would like to say thank you to Gao Xian
2678800	2681240	for bringing a very comprehensive
2681240	2684400	and rich presentation.
2684400	2687360	If I were not a student
2687360	2689520	doing research in this field,
2689520	2690400	I would be able to
2690400	2692520	understand the essence of this topic
2692520	2696160	in your 45-minute presentation.
2696160	2697600	So, thank you, Gao Xian.
2697600	2699280	At this stage,
2699280	2702320	I would like to pause the recording
2702320	2703880	and we can start
2703880	2705400	Q&A and various discussions.
