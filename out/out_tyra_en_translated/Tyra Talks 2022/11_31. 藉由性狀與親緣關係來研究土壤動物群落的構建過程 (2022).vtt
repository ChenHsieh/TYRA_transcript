WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.500
From now on, we'll move on to the recording part.

00:07.500 --> 00:12.000
We'll put this speech on YouTube as well.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.500
Please go there to replay it.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.500
Ding, please share your screen.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.500
Okay, before I share my screen,

00:22.500 --> 00:24.500
let me tell you who I am.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.500
I'm Chen Dingwen.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.000
Thank you for the introduction.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.500
I'm Dingwen Zhang, also known as Chen Dingwen.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.000
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
I think TARA is an interesting organization.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I like its purpose and purpose.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
It's to help young people in Taiwan

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and young scholars to have a platform

00:49.000 --> 00:51.500
where we can communicate with each other

00:51.500 --> 00:53.500
and get to know what everyone is busy with

00:53.500 --> 00:56.500
and what research they're doing.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.500
Why do I know about TARA?

00:59.500 --> 01:02.000
It's because I saw it on Facebook.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.500
I don't know why, but one day,

01:03.500 --> 01:05.000
this ad popped up and I thought,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
is this a young scholar from Taiwan?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.500
It's T-Y-R-A.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.500
A is association, R is researcher.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.000
T-Y-Y is what?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.500
Young scientist?

01:17.500 --> 01:18.500
Young researcher.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.000
Y is young.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
T is Taiwan.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.500
I thought, as a young scholar from Taiwan,

01:24.500 --> 01:28.500
I should join a group like this.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
When I was a kid,

01:30.500 --> 01:35.000
I spent most of my high school and college years in Taiwan.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I only had the chance to do research in Europe

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
when I was a doctor.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.500
To me, TARA is a whole new world.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.000
I know that most of TARA's members

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
are from the U.S.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I wanted to meet friends from the U.S.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
to see if they were doing ecological research like me

01:54.000 --> 01:57.500
or if they were interested in soil,

01:57.500 --> 02:00.000
or if they were doing research on evolution.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.500
I really wanted to meet these people,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.500
so I joined this group and joined their activities.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.000
For example, they have a teacher-student program.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.500
In this program, they help young people in Taiwan

02:13.500 --> 02:17.500
and those of us who have gone abroad to study.

02:17.500 --> 02:21.500
We help them on their way to study abroad,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.000
so that they can make a difference.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
We can also share with them

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
what we have learned and experienced

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
during our journey of studying abroad.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
So that they don't go down the wrong path

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
or find a better way

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
to explore their future career development.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
OK.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
This is a brief introduction to TARA.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm going to start my speech.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
I don't want to make this

02:50.500 --> 02:54.500
a formal and serious presentation.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.500
If you have any questions

02:57.500 --> 03:00.500
during my presentation,

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
you can ask me anytime.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
Of course, I know that

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
there may not be any formal questions.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500
I also have a small request.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
If you don't mind,

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
could you please turn on your camera

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
so that I can see your faces?

03:13.500 --> 03:14.500
OK.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
If you don't mind,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
could you please turn on your camera

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
so that I can see your faces?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I want to know if you find this part

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
particularly difficult to understand,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
or if you find this part particularly boring,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
or if you find this part particularly interesting.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I can explain further.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
If you don't mind,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
could you please turn on your camera

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
so that I can see your faces?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
OK.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm going to start my speech.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
First, I'm going to share my screen.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.500
I'm going to try to

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
I'm going to try to

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
make good use of my time.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.500
I know that we only have one hour today.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
What do you see now?

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
Do you see

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
the screen that I'm sharing?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.500
Lin, do you see the screen

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
that I'm sharing?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.500
Lin, do you see the screen

04:01.500 --> 04:03.500
that I'm sharing?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
Lin, do you see the screen

04:05.500 --> 04:07.500
that I'm sharing?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.500
OK.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
What you see now is

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
the structure of the root of the plant

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
under the ground.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
When you zoom in,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
what do you see?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Have you ever thought about this question?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Are there any creatures

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
that we don't know

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
or haven't seen?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm a soil ecologist.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm particularly interested

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
in the evolution of

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
soil animals.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
At the same time,

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
I'm a mentor.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
I'm a mentor.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
I joined Taira's

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
mentor project.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
I also teach some college students,

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
even PhD students.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.500
I'm also a podcaster.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
I'm actually running a podcast

04:54.500 --> 04:56.500
in 2020.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
It's a bit scientific,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
but it's called

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
Do You Read Paper?

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
It's about soil ecology.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
Some of you may know me

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
and I'm glad you can

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
participate in my speech

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
and listen to me

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
share my work and learning process.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
This is a typical

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
mountainous forest

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
in Europe.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
If I tell you

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
that there are

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
thousands of

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
animals in this forest,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
what can you see

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
from this photo?

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
In fact, you can't see them.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
Where are they?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
They live

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
in these fallen leaves

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
and in the soil

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
below the fallen leaves.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
If you dig

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
a piece of soil,

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
you can see

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
the surface of the soil.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
It's about 5 cm wide

05:57.500 --> 05:59.500
and 5 cm deep.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.500
5 to 10 cm.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
In such a small space,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
you can see

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
a maze-like structure.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
You can see

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
the fallen leaves

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
at the top

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
and the solid soil

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
at the bottom.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
In such a small space,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
it will produce some

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
environmental kinks.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
For example,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
water has a kink.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
When rainwater falls,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
the fallen leaves are wet

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
and the soil is full of nutrients.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.500
In such a small space,

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
which is very different

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
in terms of

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
geological value and

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
environment,

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
it can accommodate

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
all kinds of

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
different creatures.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
We call such a space

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
a soil.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
But in academia,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.500
we will also use

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
a term called

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
detritivores.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
We will assume that

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
it eats these

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
plants and animals.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So it is also called

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
a ten-year-old detritivores.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Living in

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
this

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
maze

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
or fallen leaves,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
you can

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
think about

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
how many of these

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
animals

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
can survive

07:31.500 --> 07:33.500
in a square meter

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
of soil.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
We can see

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
10,000 to

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
2 million detritivores.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.500
This is an amazing number.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
Think about how many grains

07:45.500 --> 07:47.500
you eat a day.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.500
But in such a

07:49.500 --> 07:51.500
small space,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
you can see

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
so many individual animals.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
How many of these

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
animals can survive

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
in a square meter of

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Wendai Forest?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Most of these

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
detritivores are very small.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Although the size of

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
their body is large,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
most of them are

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
smaller than 1 cm.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Of course, there are also

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
centipedes, centipedes,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and spiders that

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
are larger than 1 cm.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
We generally call

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
small centipedes

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
and small centipedes

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
as small centipedes.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
However,

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
there are also

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
small centipedes

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
that are smaller

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
than 1 cm.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
For example,

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
the centipede

08:46.500 --> 08:48.500
is a small centipede,

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
which is

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
a small centipede.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
We call it

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
a small centipede.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
However,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
also there are

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
medium and

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
medium-sized animals.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Why is it important?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Because when you

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
study animals,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
the first thing

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
you will learn is

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
how to classify them

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
according to their size.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Medium-sized,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
large-sized,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
and medium-sized.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
In addition,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
you can see these

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
are also medium-sized.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
There are some special ones

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
like centipedes,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
centipedes,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
and synphyrenes,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
polyporynes,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and scorpions.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I will not explain

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
the term here,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
otherwise we may not have enough time today.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
What other medium-sized animals

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
like centipedes and

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
centipedes are?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
They are also medium-sized animals.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I like

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
centipedes very much.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
What is a centipede?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You should listen to my podcast.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It should be in the fourth episode.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I have introduced

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
a science book on centipedes.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Let me explain it to you.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Centipedes are not

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
centipedes.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Centipedes are not insects.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Strictly speaking,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
centipedes are not insects.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Centipedes can be considered

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
one of the six main species.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Centipedes are now classified

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
as spiny centipedes.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
In the past, centipedes were classified as spiny centipedes.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Centipedes are now classified as spiny centipedes.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Therefore, centipedes are the

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
close relatives of insects.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
How long has centipedes

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
existed in the history of

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
chemistry and evolution?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Centipedes are one of the

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
first species of centipedes

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
that came to the earth.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Centipedes are one of the first species of centipedes

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
that came to the earth.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
There are 9,000 species of centipedes in the world.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
We can classify them into

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
four different species,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
30 different species.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The first species is

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Entomorphia.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
It is a more obvious species.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It is a more obvious species.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Most of them live on the surface.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Most of them live on the surface.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Centipedes are

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
more expressive.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Most of their food

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
comes from plants.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Most of their food comes from plants.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Another species is

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Podromorpha.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
This species has a more variable shape.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Compared to the centipede

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Entomorphia,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Podromorpha has a shorter spring.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I will talk about the spring later.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Podromorpha is a species

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
that lives in the soil.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
that lives in the soil.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
It does not need to use spring.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It does not need to use spring.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Most of the spring of Podromorpha

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
is relatively short.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
There is also Nenepleona

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
and Simipleona.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
These two species of centipedes

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
are round and look like mice.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I remember a classmate

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
who likes to study Simipleona.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I remember a classmate

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And a Taiwanese student

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
studying the centipedes

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
at a teacher's lab.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
He specially studied the Simipleona,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
who has symptoms

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
of this wood plant.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
The centipede

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
was very cute.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Centipedes live onLAUND very cutely

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and grows on the surface.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
But the Nenepleona

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
looks like the Centipedes,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
but sticks out.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
So they mostly grow

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
on the surface.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
The centipede

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
has an important feature.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Can you see my sign?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I hope you can see it.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
The centipede jumps

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
because it has a

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
bouncy structure

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
at its butt.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
This bouncy structure

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
helps it resist

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
the attack of the centipede.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So this thing

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
can make it leave

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
its original position.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That's why it's called a centipede.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
What does a centipede do?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Centipedes have

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
the ability to regulate

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
microorganisms in the ecosystem.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Centipedes can also

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
affect the group of soil

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
or promote

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
or change the

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
fallout in the soil.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It also affects the

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
chemical cycle of the soil

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and helps the plants.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
The role of the centipede

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
in the ecosystem

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
is not only to be a

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
nourisher,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
but also to be a

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
separator.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The centipede can be

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
a primary decomposer

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and a secondary decomposer.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
In addition to being

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
a primary decomposer

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
and a secondary decomposer,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
some centipedes can also

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
be a nourisher.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Centipedes can also be

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
a nourisher

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
in the soil.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
For example,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
some spiders or

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
nourishing ants can eat centipedes.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Centipedes have a softer body

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
compared to

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
other ants.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Their body is softer,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
so centipedes are

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
more delicious than

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
other hard ants.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Nourishing ants, spiders, ants, etc.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
They are also considered

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
as food for other species.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
this is the first part.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I promised you half of the science,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
and the other half is

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
half of the academic.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
OK, do you have any questions?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Let me see if there are

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
people I know online.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh, I see some people I know.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I'd like to say hello to all of you.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
If I didn't have time to say hello just now.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Okay, I'll stop here.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
If you have any questions,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
or if you don't understand

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
what I'm saying,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
please feel free to

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
ask now.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I'll give you about

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
one minute to ask.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Does it look like there are no questions?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
OK.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Let's continue.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Why do we want to know

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
about

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
centipedes?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Since centipedes

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
are very important

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
to the ecosystem,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
why do we want to know

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
about centipedes?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Because centipedes

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
are very important

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
to the ecosystem.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Of course, centipedes

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
have a certain impact

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
on the ecosystem,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
but we don't know

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
enough about them.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So we want to know

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
who they are,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
why they are here,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and why these species

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
can survive here.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Why it's them,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
not others?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
In 1975,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Anderson

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
came up with an explanation

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
to explain why

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
there are so many

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
centipedes in the soil.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Why are there so many centipedes

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
in the soil?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
As I said,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
there are tens of thousands

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
of centipedes per square meter.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Why are there so many

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
centipedes in the soil?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Why are there so many centipedes

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
in the soil?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
He summed up

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
that there are a lot of food resources

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
in the soil.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Second, we don't know

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
what they eat.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
They eat different kinds of food.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Third, the soil

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
has a high level of environmental sustainability.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
This was his idea

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
in 1975.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Now it's 2022,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
almost 50 years later.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
What have we learned?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
How far has the research

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
progressed in the past 50 years?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Is there any new hypothesis

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
or new technology

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
that can help us

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
answer the question

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
why there are so many

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
centipedes in the soil?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Why are there so many

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
centipedes in the soil?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
If you dig a soil

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
and put it under a microscope,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
you can see

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
centipedes,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
centipedes,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
centipedes,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
and centipedes.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Ecology tells us

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
that if you study biology in college,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
you may learn about

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
ecology, biophysics,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and biophysics.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Can we use the knowledge

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
we learn

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
or the knowledge

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
we learn in school

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
to explain the phenomenon

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
we see?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This is my research.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I study the biological geography

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
and their evolution

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
in the ecology of centipedes.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The question asked in the biological geography

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
is what is the distribution pattern?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Is the biological geography

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
from low to high

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
along a certain gradient?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
For example, along the gradient of the sea level,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
along the gradient of temperature,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
along the gradient of water.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
This is the issue

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
that biological geography deals with.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
What is the issue

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
that the ecology of centipedes deals with?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What is the interaction effect?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Do they have some special features

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
that can help them live in that place?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
What do they eat

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
to maintain their species?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
The third issue

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
is the evolution of biology.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
The question asked in the evolution of biology

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
is what is the origin of biodiversity?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
How do these diversities

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
come from?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Do they change from less to more

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
or from more to less?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What changes

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
besides the shape of the body

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and the different features?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Do they have some genetic basis?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Is this related

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
to the interrelationship

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
between species?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Can the organism

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
create or develop

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
its own niche,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
its own ecological position,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
its own opportunity

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
to reproduce more

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
or to diversify?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
This is the content of the evolution of biology.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm using

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
a framework

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
called CTPE,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
In Chinese, it stands for

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
This is actually

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
a more comprehensive discipline.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
It requires knowledge

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
other than the traditional

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
community ecology.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
It also requires the concept of

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
evolution of biology

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
or system development of biology.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
How does it study?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Assuming that

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
you can see the composition

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
of different species

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
on an environmental scale.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You will see

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
certain characteristics

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
of these species

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
in observation,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
so you can

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
divide them into different species.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
We will infer

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
the characteristics of

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
these species,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and assess

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
what happened to them.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Are there any processes

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
that lead to

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
the results you see now?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
What are these processes?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
There is a book in 2016

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
written by

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Mark Barron.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It is about the theory of

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
ecological communities.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
In this theory,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
he tells us that

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the structure of the community

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
is made up of

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
four main processes.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
The first process

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
is the selection process.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It is also called

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the filtering process.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
The second process is

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
the drift process.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
It is a random process

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
that affects

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
a small group of species.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
The third process is

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
the dispersion process.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
The reason why the species

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
are divided into four

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
processes is because

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
the species are

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
divided into three

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
processes.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The fourth process is

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
the seeding process.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
In my view,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
a group of species

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
is mainly affected

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
by these four processes.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It is not what you see now.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The ecological processes

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
you see now

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
are the results of

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
the filtering process.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
If you see that

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
the shape of a group of species

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
is very different,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
it is the result of

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
the dispersion process.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It sounds logical,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
so it can be done.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Let's take a look at

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
the results of my

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
previous research

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
on land animals.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
The filtering process

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
plays a role in

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
the group of species we study.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Here are two examples.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
One is a worm,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and the other is an ant in a jar.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
This is a study

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
we did in Changbai Mountain,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Northeastern China.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
We surveyed

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
the growth of

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
a species in a group of worms

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
along 10 different heights.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
We looked at the shape of

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
its body,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and the proportion of

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
the dark and light colors

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
in the group.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
We found that

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
the higher the height,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
the lower the amount

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
of egg in the soil.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
The higher the height,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
the lower the amount

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
of egg in the soil,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
and the darker the color

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
in the worm group.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
The color of the body

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
is an important shape

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
of the worm.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
This is the reason

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
why the color of the worm

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
is different.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Another example is

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
a project I'm doing

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
in the tourism area

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
in Indonesia.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
This is a project

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
we did two or three years ago.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
We surveyed ants in jars

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
and collected them

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
in a sprayer.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
We looked at the characteristics

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
of ants in jars

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and collected them

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
in a sprayer.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
We found that

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
in four different environments,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
such as tropical rainforests,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
rainforests,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
rubber fields,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
rubber fields,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
and zoological gardens,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
the characteristics of ants

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
in jars

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and their

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
habitat patterns

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
were selected by the environment.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
This is the pattern.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
How did the environment come about?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The degree of degradation of the environment

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
was caused by man-made development

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
and the way the land was used.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
As a result,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
these special-shaped ants

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
were selected.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You can see the shape

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
of these species.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
In addition to the color of the body,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
what else can you see?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
The size of the body

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
and the shape of the body.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
To put it simply,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
we can divide the shape

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
into two different categories.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
One is called Beta-nitrate

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and the other is called Alpha-nitrate.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Beta-nitrate refers to those

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
that are related to the environment,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
such as the durability of the environment,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
such as the color of the body.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
You can think of it

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
as a Beta-nitrate.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
In addition,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
the shape of Alpha-nitrate

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
is related to the way

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
the ants feed.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
This is related to the way

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
they use resources.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
If you observe the shape

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
of a species in a group,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
there may be similarities

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
and there may not be similarities.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
You can see that

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
there are three groups

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
in the three boxes on the right.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Take a closer look

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
at which ones are similar

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and which ones are not.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
The shape of the three ants

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
in the three boxes on the right

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
is the same,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
but the color is different.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Take a closer look

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
at the size of the body.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
The size of the three ants

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
in the three boxes on the right

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
is the same,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
but the color is different.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
You can see that

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
if you observe its shape,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
you can deduce that

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
in addition to filtering,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Alpha-nitrate is similar

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
in the same group.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
For Alpha-nitrate,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
the Alpha-nitrate difference

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
is relatively large

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
in the same group.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The pigmentation

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
that I just mentioned

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
is the body color change

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
of the insects along the height.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
This shows

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
that the body color

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
is a beta-nitrate

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
and the alpha-nitrate

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
can help the insects

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
live on higher altitudes.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
What is Alpha-nitrate?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
It is related to food resources.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
How do we study

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
food resources in soil animals?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
What do they eat?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
In the early days,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
they simply put an insect

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
under a microscope

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
to see what contents

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
are in its intestine.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
This technology is very good

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
in the study of

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
soil particles.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
In the early days,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
after 50 years,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
what new methods do we have?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
In the lower left corner,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
you can see a

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Trophy Image Parameter.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
This is another study.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
This is the practicality of

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
making insects.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We have chosen four

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
more common methods

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
to study different

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
insects by

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
using different methods.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
The first method

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
is the method of stable isotopes.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
This method can help us

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
know what is the feed

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
of a species in the soil food network.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Is it a feeder or

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
a first class separator or a feeder?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
This is known by

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
stable isotopes of

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
alpha-nitrate.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
We can also know

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
what is the source of

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
the feed of

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
a species in the soil.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Is it directly

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
eaten by plants

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
or those that have been

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
sterilized by bacteria?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
This is a long-term

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
accumulation process.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It takes a long time

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
to see the change

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
in stable isotopes.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Compared with this,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
neutral epiphytase,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
neutral fatty acid,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
can help us know

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
what is the feed of

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
a species in the soil.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
For example,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
this metabolism is

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
shorter than that of

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
the same species.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
So we can know

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
what is the feed of

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
a species in the soil

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
for several weeks

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
to several months.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
The second method

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
is digestive enzyme.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
These two methods

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
have been used for a long time,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
but they are still very useful.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Digestive enzymes,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
such as fiber,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and cytosine,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
can help us know

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
what is the feed of

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
a species in the soil.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Is it fiber or bacteria?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Bacteria have cytosine.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Finally,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
we need to decrypt

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
an animal to see

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
what is the feed of

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
a species in the soil.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We found that

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
these four methods

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
are not related to each other.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
It is difficult for us

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
to use one method

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to decrypt

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
the other three methods.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
The analysis results

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
show that

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
the four methods are

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
equally important.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
They reflect the

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
different aspects of

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
the whole process

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
from swallowing,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
digesting,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
absorbing,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
chronicling,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
to its body tissue.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
So,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
you can see

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
how complicated

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
this thing is.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
In addition to the shape of

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
the shape of the

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
shape of the

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
and other

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
more abstract

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
aspects,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
we also have

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
studied

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
that

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
many Species

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
are

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
more exemplary

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
than other

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
forms of

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
life.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
The original

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
species,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
there are seven

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
different species.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Let's see

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
if the gene

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
and the bacterium

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
are the same

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
number

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
or not.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
We found

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
that the gene

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and the bacterium

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
are the same number.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Next,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
we study

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
the larvae.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
We study

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
the bacteria

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
related to the larvae

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
and the same number

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
of the larvae.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Are they related?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
it's interesting

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
that the larvae

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
are not only the native species,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
but also the species

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
living on the snow.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Let's see what the larvae

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
eat on the snow.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
In winter,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
or in summer,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
there is no snow in summer,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
and there is snow in winter.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Let's see

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
if the larvae

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
will eat

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
under the snow

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
or on the snow.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
There are

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
three different larvae.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
We found that

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
there are two species

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
living on the snow.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Their same number

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
and long life

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
show that their food

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
comes from snow,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
not from soil.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Another species

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
grows between

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
snow and

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
fallen leaves.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Its same number

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and bacteria

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I like this research

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
because it uses

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
two different methods

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
to answer

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
an interesting question.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
What do the larvae eat

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
on the snow?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
It's not the same as

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
what we usually know.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
So,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
we used the shape

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
to see the similarity

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
of the shape

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
or the relationship

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
between the shape

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
and the larvae.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
What is the ecological process?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Is it the filtration process

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
or the division process

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
that affects

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the group formation of

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
the larvae?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Next,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
we will talk about

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
the evolution

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
of the shape

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and the formation

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
of the species.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
This is the multidimensional shape.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
When you put different species

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
on an evolution relationship tree,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
such as the system of evolution

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
or the evolution tree,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
what will you see?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
You will see these three species,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
these three round species,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
like the mouse species,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
come from the same evolution value.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
So, here you will see

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
a system of evolution.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
On the shape,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
you will see a system of evolution.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Another situation is

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
that you see these three green larvae.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Although they are all green,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
they come from different evolution values.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
These three round larvae

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
come from the same evolution value.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
These three green larvae

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
come from different evolution values.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
This is the difference.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Do they come from the same evolution value?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
The more similar species are,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
the more similar they are

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
on the shape.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
we use the relationship

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
between species.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
This relationship may be determined

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
by the DNA sequence

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
and compared.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
We look at the difference

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
in the DNA sequence.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Is the difference in the relationship

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
related to the shape of the species?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Then we can

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
understand the evolution process.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
What I just said is

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
similar species

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
should be said

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
to be similar species.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
The shape of

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
similar species is generally similar.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
This is a necessary result.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
We call such a phenomenon

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
a system of evolution

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
with a system of evolution.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
The nature of the

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
jump worm

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
is composed of

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
neutral fatty acids.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Neutral fatty acids allow us to know

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
whether the source of food

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
is mainly bacteria or plants.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Neutral fatty acids

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
also allow us to know

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
how the jump worm adapts to temperature.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
We find that

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
most of the neutral fatty acids

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
related to physiological

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
and temperature adaptation

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
show a system of evolution.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
However, those fatty acids

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
related to food resources

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
do not show a system of evolution.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
What I just said is

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
the growth of

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
germin.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
The growth of germin

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
is related to

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
the stable number of germin.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
The growth of germin

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
is related to the source of food.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
In contrast,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the relationship between

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
germin bacteria and the number of germin

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
is not so strong.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Instead, it is related to

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
the system of evolution of germin.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What does this show?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It shows that these bacteria

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
may be a symbiotic bacteria for germin.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
The relationship between germin and germin

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
is relatively close.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Germin may be a food,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
so it is the same number as germin.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
The number of germin reflects

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
the position of germin in the food network.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Therefore, these bacteria

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
can be a food

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
and the number of germin

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
can reflect the food network.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
So this thing can be linked together.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
What else does the evolution of germin

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
have in common?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
We asked the question

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
how do these species come from?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
You can put these species

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
together as a database.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
These species in the group

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
are actually a part

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
of a large database.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
A subset.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
These species

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
have a database first,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
and then they are selected

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
or divided into different groups.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
What is the evolution process?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
We asked

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
how this database was formed.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
On a historical context,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
from ancient to modern,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
how do these shapes change?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
How are these species formed?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
There are two hypotheses.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
You can imagine

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
that I just introduced

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
a vertical natural belt

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
at Changbai Mountain in the northeast.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
The height of the peak.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Do these jump worms

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
evolve at high altitude first?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Or do they evolve separately

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and then expand?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
What you see now

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
are three arrows in the middle.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
The three arrows point to the group.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Among the groups,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
these three species

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
all come from the same evolution.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So it is possible that

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
there is a group first,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
this is the base,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
and then the process of germination

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
occurs in it.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So this germination speciation

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
is a relatively recent process.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
That is to say,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
it is possible that

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
there are three species

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and then the species changes.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Compared to this,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
you can see that

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
it is the same as this green frame.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
This frame is a specific evolution.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But the three green jump worms

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
in this frame

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
come from different evolution.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
It is possible that

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
these three jump worms

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
are formed first

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and then some ecological effects

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
occur in this frame.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So there are jump worms first

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
and then ecological effects.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So it is called oligopersistence.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
The one in front is speciation,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
recent speciation,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
the most recent evolution.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
The one behind is

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
a relatively old group,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
a relatively old species,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
they spread and gather together.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
So on a high altitude or

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
at an altitude of a mountain range,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
is the jump worm first

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
or is it formed

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
at different altitudes?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
These are two studies

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
in my previous research

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
that are more representative

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
of the formation of jump worms

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
and the evolution of jump worms.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
The question is

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
how these jump worms are formed.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
This study is a wide-spread

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
jump worm

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
that we have investigated

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and it is actually

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
a wide-spread jump worm.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
We think it has only one form.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So we can only identify it

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
as this kind,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Leptosuchus longinus.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
But we use DNA

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
to compare its sequence.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
We found that

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
there are not only one type

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
in GÃ¶ttingen andå¨é­.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In fact, there are three different types.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
We call them lineages

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
because we are not sure

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
how far the relationship between them is.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
How far is it?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It is so far that they have separated

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
when they were in Myosin.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
This is a process of millions of years.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
So we think

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
it may not be

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
the same species.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
We also found

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
an interesting phenomenon.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
These three different lineages

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
mean that

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
they prefer different

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
genotypes.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
The first lineage

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
prefers farmland,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
the second prefers forest,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
and the third prefers grassland.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It seems that environmental filtering

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
plays a certain role here.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Environment makes

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
these jump worms

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
have some DNA division.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
But we know little about it.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
We do not know

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
what shape can

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
reflect these divisions.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
We only know that its form is the same,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
or it is different.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
French tells us

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
that these three lineages can only

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
separate two lineages.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
The two lineages 2 and 3

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
cannot be separated at all.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
What is the difference between 1 and the other two?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
The only difference is

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
the ratio of the difference

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
between the two hairs on the side.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
So the color, body size,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
or scale distribution

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
are not known.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
We can't find one

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
to explain the difference

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
or the reason why

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
they prefer different genotypes.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
But we know that

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
genotypes have an impact on

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
the DNA division of jump worms.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Let's go back to the research

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
in Changbai Mountain, northeast China.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
In this research,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
we found more than 20 types of

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
jump worms.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
We want to explore

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
what causes

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
more than 20 types of jump worms,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
not only 5 or 10.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Are these jump worms

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
related to

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
the evolution of

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
the environment

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
in ancient times

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
or now?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
According to some statistics,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
we know that

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
these jump worms

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
may be related to

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
the pH of soil

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and the type of rock.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
When did Changbai Mountain

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
form?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Changbai Mountain is the

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
red star

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
and the dotted line.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
After the dotted line,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Changbai Mountain

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
was formed.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
But these jump worms

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
have already been

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
divided into different types

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
before they formed.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Obviously,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
these jump worms

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
are related to

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
the evolution of

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
the environment

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
in ancient times.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Therefore,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
the evolution of

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
3D organisms,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
3D soil organisms,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
and 3D jump worms

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
is not a major factor

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
in the evolution of

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
3D organisms.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
In fact,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
the evolution of

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
3D organisms

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
can explain

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
the existence of

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
3D soil organisms

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
in ancient times.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
OK.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
We still have some time.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Next time,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
when you observe

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
these soil organisms

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
with some special means,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
we can think about

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
what caused

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
these

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
colorful soil organisms

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
to eat different foods

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
and live in

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
different environments.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
After 50 years,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
it seems that we have

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
a new understanding of these soil organisms.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
So,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
this is the method

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I use for my research.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
In general,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
when we do ecological research,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
we look at the environment

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
in which these soil organisms

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
grow.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
In the study of soil,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
we generally measure

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
the amount of water in the soil,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
the pH value of the soil,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
and the amount of carbon in the soil.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
We also do some measurements

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
of microorganisms,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
such as the amount of microorganisms,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
the speed of microorganisms' breathing,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and the composition of microorganisms.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
These are environmental variables

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
that affect the environment

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
they grow in,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
including their food resources,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
some of their physical and chemical

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
non-living factors.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
In this environment,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
we will identify

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
which species they belong to.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
The composition of these species,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
the composition of all individuals,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
is called a group.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
So, we will get

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
a group of data

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
about the soil organisms themselves.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
During the identification process,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
we will look at the shape of their bodies.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
They look different.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
We can classify them into different species.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
But we also have to think about

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
whether they have the same food resources.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
So, we have to know

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
what kind of food they eat.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
This part of the data

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
is called the shape of the data.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Finally, we can draw DNA

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
from these species.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Then, we will make a series of DNA

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
to make their cyanobacteria.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Based on these cyanobacteria,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
we can deduce

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
the evolution process

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
or the evolution pattern

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
in the past.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
This can tell us

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
the system development of these species.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It can also tell us

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
the formation of the species

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
and its shape.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
So, this DNA series

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
can be called

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
the fourth type of data.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I just said

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
that I am a data analyst.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I specialize in data analysis.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
So, most of my work

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
is to analyze these four types of data

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
to see their relationship

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
or the difference between them.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Based on this analysis,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
we can answer

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
which ecological processes

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
are filtered,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
divided,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
or dispersed

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
to affect the biodiversity

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
of these species.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
We can also find out

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
why these species exist.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Let me summarize.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Filtering and

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
dividing are

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
the two main processes

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
in Markvillain's

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
selection process

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and the ecological process.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
So far,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
these two processes,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
especially the filtering process,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
show the shape of

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
the body color.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
If we want to know

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
the process of diversification,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
we may need to use

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
some shapes related to food resources.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
This must be achieved

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
by using stable isotopes,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
neutral fatty acids,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
enzymes, and long-distance microorganisms.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
These four different ways

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
to study

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
the food resources

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
can help us

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
better understand

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
their food sources

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
and food faces.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
This includes

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
swallowing, digesting,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
absorbing, and digesting.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
The whole process

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
of

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
getting nutrients.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
In addition,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
regarding the evolution process,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
we found that most of the shape

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
is systemically developed.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
That is to say,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
the more similar species

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
are more similar

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
in shape.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
However,

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
their food sources

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
are different.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
What did I just say?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
The more similar species

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
are more similar

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
in shape.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
But the food they eat

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
may be different.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
The more similar species

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
are more similar

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
in shape.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
In the 3D system,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
we know that

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
3D soil organisms

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
do not evolve

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
from high altitudes.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Instead,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
the current evidence shows

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
that they come from

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
several older species.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Then,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
through some ecological processes,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
or environmental filtering,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
they can gather together.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Next time,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
when you walk into a forest,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
you might as well

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
take a look at the soil

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
and see if there are any animals.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Try to find

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
these cute little animals.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
That's my report.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Thank you very much

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
for giving me this opportunity

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
to talk about my research.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I also want to thank

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
everyone who has supported me

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
in the past,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
including my teachers,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
colleagues, friends,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and assistants in the lab.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
That's all for my report.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I'll stop sharing now.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I didn't expect

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
that there are

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
16 people in the audience

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
who don't know me.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Thank you.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Do you have

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
any questions?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
If you don't want

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
to turn on the microphone,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
you can type your questions

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
in the chat.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I'll help you ask.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
No one has

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
any questions,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
so I'll ask first.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Ding Wenxiang,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
you mentioned that

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
the amount of carbon dioxide

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
is related to the altitude

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
and that the altitude

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
is related to the body color.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Are you implying

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
that the body color

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
are related?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
What you showed

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
on the chart

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
is that the amount of carbon dioxide

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
is related to the body color

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and that the body color

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
are related.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Logically,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
we can understand that

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
the body color

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
are related.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
But the data

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
show that

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
the body color

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
are not related.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I can't find

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
the same altitude

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
with different body color

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and see the difference

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
in the amount of carbon dioxide.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Do you have similar data?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
In theory,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
the number of

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
insects

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
in the same altitude

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
should be quite common.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
So in theory,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
you should be able to find

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
the same altitude

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
with different amount of carbon dioxide

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
But this is

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
a bit strange.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Why is the amount of carbon dioxide

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
related to the body color?

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
This is an interesting point.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You just said

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
that we can find

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
different points

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
on the same altitude

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
and see if the amount of carbon dioxide

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
will affect the body color.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I can say that

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
it should not affect the body color.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Of course,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
from a mechanical point of view,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
it is difficult to find

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
a mechanism

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
to explain

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
why the amount of carbon dioxide

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
will affect the body color.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
As I said,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
the UV ray

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
may be harmful to the animal.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
So it must have a deeper body color

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
to resist or protect it

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
from such strong UV rays.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
It may be easier to say this.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
But you remind me of a point.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
In fact, when we were doing the research,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
we measured

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
three points on this altitude.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
No,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
we measured five points.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
These five points

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
were finally analyzed

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
as a random factor.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
So we don't really care

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
about the difference

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
between the five points

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
on the same altitude.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Our question is

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
the difference between different altitudes.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Whether it is the difference

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
between the altitude

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
and the amount of carbon dioxide

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
in the soil,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
we want to find

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
the one that can best explain

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
the body color distribution

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
of this group

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
in statistics.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
In statistics,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
but you will find

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
that it is more difficult

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
to understand.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So your data

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
is still taken by you,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
instead of doing

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
a meta-data analysis.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Most of what I just said

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
is my own actual research

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
and data.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
The real meta-analysis

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
is the relationship

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
between the four methods

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
of soil erosion.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
That is the meta-analysis.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
We still like to go out in the wild

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and actually measure the material

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
to see what the animals look like.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I prefer to sit in front of the computer

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
and analyze the data.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I need my colleagues

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
and friends

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
to provide the first-hand data.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Then we have the opportunity

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
to reuse their data

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
and ask different scientific questions.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So I really appreciate

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
and cherish their contribution

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
to soil biology.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Of course, everyone

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
has to find their own niche

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
and partition

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
in order to

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
find what they like

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
and share the knowledge

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
with their colleagues.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Some of my colleagues

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
are very good at

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
soil biology,

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
and they are also

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
very good at

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
identification biology.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
In this respect,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
we are just a

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
complementary role.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Do you have any questions?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I don't want to be recorded.
