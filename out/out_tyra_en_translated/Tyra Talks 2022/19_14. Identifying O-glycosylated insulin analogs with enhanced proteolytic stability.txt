Hello everyone, welcome to today's TARA Talk.
TARA stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.
It is a friendly forum for young researchers in Taiwan.
We hold TARA Talk every week and every weekend throughout the year.
The format and content of this talk are very free and diverse.
Researchers can share their academic achievements,
practice online presentations,
or get to know potential future collaborators.
Today's speaker is...
Wei-Zhe, would you like to share your screen?
Okay.
Is it on?
Yes, it is.
Today's speaker is Wei-Zhe Xu.
He is currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder
in Chemical and Biological Engineering.
Today's talk is on Identifying Signature of...
Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce that word.
Protolytic Stability and Dimerization Properties.
He is a simulator.
He gave a wonderful talk at TARA.
As usual at TARA,
before the talk starts,
we will turn on the microphone and give a warm welcome to Wei-Zhe.
Okay, thank you.
Should I start?
Yes, you can start.
Hello everyone, I am Wei-Zhe Xu.
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder.
My main interest in this course is to use...
computer molecular dynamics simulations...
to study different biological and physical phenomena...
or develop related algorithms.
Thank you for coming to this talk.
Today's talk is similar to the one I gave at TARA.
This is my first time to use Chinese...
to explain this academic research.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's okay to interrupt me.
Without further ado, let's get started.
Today we are going to discuss...
how to use computer simulation...
to find out the factors that affect...
the properties of the permutations.
Before we get into today's topic,
let's take a look at what a permutation looks like.
A permutation is a protein molecule.
It is composed of two amino acids.
The blue one and the yellow one.
They are chain A and chain B.
You may have heard of it.
The biggest relationship between a permutation and humans...
is that it is widely used in diabetes treatment.
For example, there are 34 million people in the US...
who are diabetic.
7 million of them use permutations...
as their main treatment method.
Most of the treatment channels for permutations...
are done through subcutaneous injection.
Diabetic patients...
usually need to be injected 30 minutes before meals.
This means that diabetes patients...
need to be injected 2-3 times a day.
If you need to be injected 2-3 times a day,
it will be very uncomfortable.
The biggest drawback of subcutaneous injection...
is that it is very invasive.
In the past 20 years,
scientists have tried to develop...
non-invasive treatment channels...
to reduce the use of subcutaneous injection.
One of the most potential treatment channels...
is the so-called oral-diphtheria.
20 years have passed.
This research has been going on for more than 20 years.
Why is it that...
we don't hear much about...
oral-diphtheria drugs on the market?
The reason is that...
the development of oral-diphtheria drugs...
has many major challenges.
Most of these challenges...
come from the digestive system of the human body.
The first challenge is that...
when the gastrointestinal tract goes through the human stomach,
gastric acid will destroy the gastrointestinal structure.
The gastrointestinal tract will lose its function.
Basically, this challenge...
has been completely solved...
some time ago.
Most of the mainstream use...
is to use some special materials to protect the gastrointestinal tract.
The gastrointestinal tract can...
This special material...
will not be dissolved in the case of acidity.
This can protect the gastrointestinal tract...
from being corroded by gastric acid.
When leaving the stomach,
the gastrointestinal tract...
will be dissolved.
The gastrointestinal tract will be dissolved.
The drug will be released.
The first challenge has been solved.
But it was a major challenge...
in the development of oral-diphtheria drugs.
The next two challenges...
have not been completely solved yet.
The first challenge is that...
the stability of the gastrointestinal system is not very good.
The reason is that...
many digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal system...
destroy the gastrointestinal tract.
This will also cause the gastrointestinal tract to lose its function.
In addition, the gastrointestinal tract...
is not very transparent to the cell membrane.
Usually, we will see that...
two gastrointestinal molecules...
may gather together...
and then...
become a so-called gastrointestinal 2-gene.
This 2-gene...
is a relatively large molecule.
So it is more difficult to pass through the cell membrane.
The human body's absorption...
of gastrointestinal 2-gene...
will also become lower.
So the following two challenges...
have not been completely solved yet.
Therefore, if we want to develop oral-diphtheria drugs,
we know that...
we hope that oral-diphtheria drugs...
will achieve at least two goals.
The first goal is that...
we hope that it has enough resistance...
to the digestive enzymes in the human body.
The second goal is that...
we hope that it has a relatively low gathering tendency...
so that it is easier to reach a higher absorption...
of gastrointestinal 2-gene.
In the past few years,
there have been a lot of different research methods...
to experiment with...
how to achieve these two goals at the same time.
A few years ago,
in a chemistry synthesis lab...
that we worked with,
they found that...
in a specific location of the gastrointestinal tract,
a specific type of sugar can be added...
to improve...
the gastrointestinal tract's resistance...
to enzymes.
In addition,
it can effectively reduce its gathering tendency.
This method is called sugarification.
Basically,
it is the structure of...
a sugar molecule...
connected to a gastrointestinal tract.
In the research...
conducted by our laboratory,
they studied a total of 12 different...
gastrointestinal tracts.
You can see that...
these 12 gastrointestinal tracts...
basically have three control mutations.
The first one is...
the location of sugarification.
Here, you can see...
my mouse.
This is the structure of the gastrointestinal tract.
These balls...
are basically the amino acids...
that can be sugarified.
There are a total of 51 amino acids in the gastrointestinal tract.
Only five of them...
can be added to sugar.
The first mutation is...
the location of sugarification.
The second mutation is...
the type of sugar.
For example, we can see here...
GALNAC.
In English, it's N-Acetyl Glycosamin.
I'm not sure how to say it in Chinese,
but it's a type of sugar.
The other type of sugar is MANOS.
The main purpose is to study...
the sugarification mechanism of these two types of sugar.
The third type is...
the size of the type of sugar.
You can see that the last few types of sugar...
from the 7th to the 13th...
basically use MANOS...
as the base of the type of sugar.
They may use the type of sugar...
the type of MANOS...
the type of MANOS-2 or type of MANOS-3...
to modify the structure of the amino acid.
For example,
you can see that...
the picture here...
is the structure of a sugarified amino acid.
The blue and yellow...
are the amino acids.
The purple is...
the type of MANOS-3.
The location of sugarification...
is the B27 amino acid.
OK.
So...
in our...
collaborative lab...
research,
how did they...
from these different sugarified amino acids...
find a structure...
that is more likely to be used as an amino acid...
for oral medication?
They did a series of experiments.
Today, I'm going to talk about the most important one.
First of all,
they measured the resistance of the amino acids.
Basically,
I put the amino acids...
and the sugarified amino acids...
in the same solution...
to monitor...
when the amino acid...
is cut off.
Then, we can measure...
how long it takes...
for the sugarified amino acids...
to be broken down by the amino acids.
The time it takes...
is called alpha-contription half-life.
Alpha-contription half-life...
is the amino acid...
that our collaborative lab uses.
It can break down the amino acids.
Half-life means...
the amino acids...
are cut into two parts.
So, they lose some of their quality.
The weight is reduced.
So, we can detect...
the amino acids.
Basically, the longer it takes...
means that the amino acids...
need to break down the amino acids.
The longer it takes...
means that the structure of the amino acids...
is more resistant to the amino acids.
On the far left, we can see...
the so-called wild-type.
It's a circular amino acid.
It doesn't go through any type of sugar.
We can see that...
in the 12 types of amino acids...
the numbers 9, 10, and 13...
are the half-life...
of the alpha-contription half-life.
This means that...
the amino acids need to break down...
the amino acids...
for a longer time.
This means that...
the amino acids are more resistant to the amino acids.
The important ones are 10 and 13.
9 is a little bit higher than the wild-type.
10 and 13 are significantly better...
than the circular amino acids.
Coincidentally,
these three structures...
also have...
relatively low...
relative gathering tendency.
On the right,
you can see that...
the wild-type is on the far left.
The three on the right are 9, 10, and 13.
The blue part of the graph...
shows the ratio of the amino acids.
The green part...
shows the ratio of the half-life.
We hope that...
the lower the relative gathering tendency,
the better.
The higher the amino acid ratio,
the better.
We can see that...
9, 10, and 13...
are more resistant to the amino acids.
We can see that...
these three amino acids...
have relatively low relative gathering tendency.
What is the most important discovery...
of this study?
The most important discovery is that...
if you look at the structure of 9, 10, and 13,
its name is a little bit long.
It's a little bit strange.
But from its name,
you can probably tell that...
these three structures...
are all in the position of...
the B27.
The group that is connected to the B27...
are the single-unit...
2-gene...
or 3-gene.
So, the most important discovery...
of this study is that...
scientists found that...
among these 10 kinds of...
amino acids,
if we connect the single-unit...
2-gene...
or 3-gene to the B27,
it can effectively improve the quality...
of the amino acids.
It is more suitable to be used...
as an oral medication.
We already know that...
in the experiment...
in the general chemical synthesis experiment,
we are likely to be able to...
experiment with a dozen kinds of...
amino acids one by one...
and then synthesize them one by one.
Then compare them one by one with wild-type...
to identify which amino acid...
has the best quality.
But if we want to find...
the best amino acid for oral medication,
if we want to find the best...
amino acid,
do we need to synthesize...
thousands of kinds of...
amino acids?
Of course, this process...
is very time-consuming.
Usually, to synthesize...
an amino acid...
that does not exist in the natural world,
it may take a few months.
If it is long, it may take 1-2 years.
So, when...
chemical synthesizers...
synthesize these amino acids,
they think that...
this is too much trouble...
and too much time...
and too much money.
Then they start to think that...
if I can't quickly and efficiently...
use chemical synthesis to complete this thing,
I don't know if computer simulation...
can do this thing.
That's why...
our co-worker...
came to us...
to do a computer simulation.
The answer to this question is...
of course, it's possible.
We can use computer simulation...
to predict...
which of the selected...
amino acids...
may contain the best...
amino acid.
Our simulation method...
is called molecular thermodynamics simulation.
Molecular thermodynamics simulation...
is a very vast subject.
It has a lot of...
hundreds of...
different simulations.
Before I talk about...
the common points of these simulations,
we can think about...
a simple question about sports.
For example, you start from...
your door today.
You walk 1 meter every second.
Where will you be after 10 seconds?
The answer is...
you will be 10 meters away from your home.
This is a very simple question...
about sports.
Most students in high school...
are familiar with...
complex sports questions.
For example, acceleration...
and force.
These questions are basically...
as long as we know the starting speed...
and starting position of an object...
and we consider the force...
and acceleration...
we can estimate...
where the object will appear...
at a certain point in time.
In a complex system,
we can even know...
the position, speed...
and acceleration of the object...
at any point in time...
or even the energy.
Basically,
this is what molecular dynamics...
is doing.
In simple terms,
molecular dynamics...
is an effective way...
to solve...
a series of...
Newton's second law...
and the Hamiltonian.
How is molecular dynamics...
actually done?
In a molecular dynamics simulation...
we have a simulation box.
In this simulation box...
we put in all the...
atoms and molecules we want to simulate.
For example,
if I want to simulate...
a permutation of a number...
I put the permutation of a number...
into the simulation box.
I want to simulate...
a water-soluble...
water-soluble...
water-soluble...
water-soluble...
water-soluble.
If I want to keep...
the system neutral...
I add some...
oxygen or nitrogen...
to keep the system neutral.
Basically,
in the...
simulation box...
for each atom...
for each atom and molecule...
we have the initial speed...
speed, position...
and energy...
and so on.
Through these initial conditions...
initial conditions...
or initial conditions...
if you've studied the equation...
it's actually initial conditions.
With these initial conditions...
we can calculate...
all the atoms...
at a certain point in the future...
the position...
the speed...
the energy...
and so on.
In a molecular dynamic simulation...
we can know...
in the simulation box...
how each object...
moves...
or even...
in our case...
how the inner structure...
is close or far from each other.
The animation you see now...
you can see different parts...
moving around.
Basically,
molecular dynamic simulation...
allows us to see...
how an atom...
or an atom and an atom...
interact with each other.
With the method...
we can define...
the goal of our research.
Our method is...
molecular dynamic simulation.
Our goal is...
to build a simulation...
so we don't have to...
do chemical synthesis.
We can find...
the most likely...
high-resistance...
and low-resistance structure...
from a series of...
carboxylic acids.
This is our overall goal.
In order to build...
this simulation method...
we basically focus on...
the 12 elements...
of carboxylic acids...
studied by experimentalists.
In the simulation...
we first find...
5 elements of carboxylic acids.
Starting from these 5 elements...
each of them...
is like a template.
Each template...
can be used to generate...
12 carboxylic acids.
There are 65 elements...
in the template.
Each of these 65 elements...
is a long enough...
molecular dynamic simulation.
The basic logic...
is that...
we run a carboxylic acid simulation...
followed by a carboxylic acid simulation.
We compare...
the trajectories...
or the physical properties...
to see if there are any differences.
We try to figure out...
what are the causes...
that lead to...
carboxylic acid resistance...
or carboxylic acid resistance.
We know that...
the entire process...
is...
just by looking at...
the carboxylic acid simulation...
we can't see anything.
Too many atoms and molecules...
are moving at the same time.
Many things...
have to be...
quantified in the simulation.
The workflow...
is to set up a hypothesis.
We can assume that...
a certain amount of carboxylic acid...
is...
able to affect...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
or the carboxylic acid resistance.
Then we use the simulation...
to calculate the amount of carboxylic acid...
and compare it with the experiment.
If it matches the experiment...
it means that the hypothesis...
is plausible.
If it doesn't match...
it means that the hypothesis...
is not plausible.
In this research...
we set up many different hypotheses...
for two types of carboxylic acid resistance...
and carboxylic acid resistance.
There are many words here.
I won't explain them one by one...
because they will be mentioned later.
Let's take a look...
at the hypothesis.
First, we will focus on...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
of the carboxylic acid.
Then we will look back...
at the togethering of carboxylic acid.
Then we will look at...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
of the carboxylic acid.
And then we will...
talk about the interaction between...
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid.
The interaction between...
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...
is mainly...
The first step is...
I simplify it.
The mechanism is...
First, the carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...
will be combined.
After that, the carboxylic acid will cut...
some positions of the carboxylic acid.
Then cut the carboxylic acid into two halves...
or even three halves...
three parts, four parts, etc.
But basically, as long as the carboxylic acid is cut...
it will lose its function.
In all 51 amino acids of carboxylic acid...
five of them...
may be...
cut off by alpha-carbotripsin...
the carboxylic acid.
The two places...
that are most likely to be cut off...
are B25 and B26...
the two amino acids.
You can see here...
some of the rings...
are the structure of the carboxylic acid.
They will be cut off.
Where is the cut off?
For example,
for B25 carboxylic acid...
the cut off is between...
B25 and B26...
the part of the carboxylic acid.
For B26 carboxylic acid...
the cut off is between...
B26 and B27...
the part of the carboxylic acid.
Based on this understanding...
we know that...
the carboxylic acid...
needs to be cut off.
There is a necessary factor...
that is...
the carboxylic acid...
needs to be cut off...
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.
The whole set of logic...
that we study...
is to see...
what is the necessary factor...
that needs to be cut off.
We need to see...
if there is a way...
to destroy the necessary factor.
In this case...
the necessary factor is...
that the carboxylic acid...
needs to be cut off...
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.
The first assumption...
is that...
if the carboxylic acid is stored...
inside the carboxylic acid...
it won't be cut off.
This assumption means that...
the structure...
has a higher resistance to carboxylic acid.
This is a full assertion.
We assume that if a...
sugar is added to the carboxylic acid...
the cut-off sugar is...
guaranteed to be stored inside.
This is a possible...
and effective mechanism.
What do we need to do in this simulation?
How do we quantify this?
How do we quantify this?
How do we quantify this?
We measure something called SASA.
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.
On paper, this means that...
the surface area...
of a carboxylic acid...
in the carboxylic acid environment.
This means that...
the larger the SASA...
the larger the surface area...
of the carboxylic acid.
We assume that...
the carboxylic acid...
is exposed outside.
If it's covered inside...
it may not even be exposed to water.
So our assumption today is...
if a carboxylic acid...
can lower the SASA...
of the carboxylic acid B25 and B26...
it is very likely...
that it can raise the resistance...
of the carboxylic acid...
to the carboxylic acid.
Let's take a look...
This diagram looks a bit complicated...
but basically...
B25 and B26...
are the SASA...
of two different positions.
The axis...
is the time it takes...
for the carboxylic acid...
to digest the carboxylic acid.
So...
the simplest way...
since there are many data points...
the simplest way...
is to look at the numbers 10 and 13...
the two carboxylic acids.
Numbers 10 and 13...
are the two carboxylic acids...
that have the highest resistance...
to the carboxylic acid...
in the experiment.
We can see that...
these two carboxylic acids...
have a half-life...
longer than the other carboxylic acids.
This is the result of the experiment.
It shows that...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
is higher in the experiment.
We can also see that...
these two carboxylic acids...
especially number 13...
have the lowest SASA value.
This means that...
when the SASA value is low...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
can be improved.
Although...
number 10 and 13...
seem to be consistent...
with the experiment results...
there are many exceptions.
For example, in the square on the right...
we can see that...
the half-life of the carboxylic acid...
is relatively low.
This means that...
the carboxylic acid resistance...
is relatively low.
However, the SASA value...
is actually in the middle.
This is contrary...
to the experiment results.
So, from this...
measurement method...
we can only know that...
the SASA measurement method...
can only give us...
partial accurate prediction.
For those...
carboxylic acids...
with high SASA resistance...
their prediction may be accurate.
However, for those...
in the middle value...
their prediction ability...
is not so good.
Obviously, we have to...
find a better...
model...
to...
to model this phenomenon.
Basically, this model...
the first model...
is to look at...
the interface between...
the transfer function and the coefficient.
The second model...
is based on...
the 2-level structure of the transfer function.
First of all, the 2-level structure of the transfer function...
is related to...
the location of the carboxylic acid.
Let's look at...
this graph.
This circle represents...
the carboxylic acid...
which is B25 or B26.
The location of the carboxylic acid...
is C and P1'.
P1' is the carboxylic acid next to C.
It is...
the direction of the carbon.
The opposite direction is...
P1, P2 and P3.
In the past experiments...
we found that...
the area from P1 to P3...
is usually...
from the past experiments...
the area from P1 to P3...
is usually...
from the past experiments...
the area from P1 to P3...
is the omega3 structure...
in the combination with...
alpha-carbotrypsin.
This omega3 structure...
is a necessary factor...
required...
for therefore,
for example,
our target omega3...
oding is very important.
loss of atoms is between B25 and B26.
Which means...
from P1 to P3 are equal to...
if we take B25 as an example,
P1 is 24,
followed by 2 3 2 2,
for B26,
P1 P2 P3 are 23-25.
If we take both actions,
B25-B26,
we need to consider B22-B25,
P1-P3,
the 2-level structure.
Here,
our assumption is
if P1-P3
become
the lower the beta-shear tendency,
it will be able to
increase the antiparticle resistance.
Here,
I would like to remind you that
our logic is always the same.
When we assume
the beta-shear is
the necessary condition
for the antiparticle resistance,
we will try to break this condition.
Let's assume that
P1-P3
become the lower the beta-shear tendency,
it will be able to
avoid the antiparticle resistance.
In simulation,
how do we calculate
the beta-shear tendency
in this region?
Here is a graph called
Raman-Schrödinger plot.
I won't go into details here.
Basically,
it measures
each amino acid,
we are interested in amino acids,
B22-B25,
each amino acid,
and locate
the location of
each point
in the graph.
The more red points
appear in this region,
it means
the higher the antiparticle resistance
is.
We hope that
the lower the beta-shear tendency.
Let's see
the simulation data.
Here,
the graph looks
a bit complicated,
so I won't
go into details.
Basically,
here is the conclusion.
We found that
the beta-shear tendency
of P1 to P3
is not related to
the antiparticle resistance
of the guide tree.
Some of them
are not even related.
This means
that
our hypothesis
is wrong.
The reason is
that
if you are interested,
I can explain it later.
Basically,
the takeaway here
is that
the second hypothesis is still wrong.
Since the second hypothesis is still wrong,
we have to think about the third hypothesis.
Let me
help you review.
The first hypothesis
is based on
the difference between
the antiparticle resistance
of P1 to P3.
The second hypothesis
is based on
the second structure of the guide tree.
The third hypothesis
is based on
the interaction between
the guide tree
and the antiparticle resistance
of P1 to P3.
In the past,
we found that
alpha-chromotrypsin
interacts with
the protein
that can be cut
by alpha-chromotrypsin.
In this example,
we can see
that
the yellow circle
is the part of the guide tree.
The square below
is the amino acid
of alpha-chromotrypsin.
In the past,
we found that
alpha-chromotrypsin interacts
with the amino acid of
alpha-chromotrypsin.
The interaction between
alpha-chromotrypsin and
alpha-chromotrypsin
is very common.
The four groups
are the standard
interactions
between the
alpha-chromotrypsin
and the
alpha-chromotrypsin.
In this example,
alpha-chromotrypsin
interacts with
the amino acid of
alpha-chromotrypsin.
The interaction between
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin
is very common.
The interaction between
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin
is very common.
In the case of
alpha-chromotrypsin,
the interaction
between
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin
is very common.
We found that
the interaction between
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin
is very common.
The biggest difference between
alpha-chromotrypsin and
alpha-chromotrypsin is that
alpha-chromotrypsin contains
a type of sugar,
whereas alpha-chromotrypsin
does not.
Let's assume that
the addition of
a type of sugar
can disrupt
the network of
alpha-chromotrypsin.
In other words,
if alpha-chromotrypsin
prefers sugar
as a donor,
alpha-chromotrypsin will
interact with sugar
to create
a bond between
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin.
For example,
there are several couples
in front of you
and you want to
disrupt the bond between
them,
so you throw down
a type of sugar,
like alpha-chromotrypsin.
Alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin
form a new bond.
Let's assume that
sugar can disrupt
the network of
alpha-chromotrypsin
and alpha-chromotrypsin.
Let's see
if simulation
supports this assumption.
First,
we can see
the two structures
with the highest
alpha-chromotrypsin.
We know that
10 and 13
have the highest
alpha-chromotrypsin.
13 is the first one.
13,
we call it
the adsorption power
which can be
caused by
alpha-chromotrypsin
and
alpha-chromotrypsin.
13
has four
adsorption power
with
the highest
alpha-chromotrypsin.
9
has two
adsorption power.
5 and 12
have similar
adsorption power
with alpha-chromotrypsin.
Therefore,
as long as there is
adsorption power,
alpha-chromotrypsin
is better
for alpha-chromotrypsin.
We can see
as long as there is
more adsorption power,
alpha-chromotrypsin
is better for
alpha-chromotrypsin.
The rest
are
alpha-chromotrypsin
with lower
adsorption power
than
alpha-chromotrypsin.
Only
number 6
has lower
adsorption power
than alpha-chromotrypsin.
Although
number 6
has adsorption power,
we can see
that the adsorption power
