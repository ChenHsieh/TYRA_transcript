Thank you all for participating in today's Project T.R.
I am the host today.
I am Kao-Hsien, Ph.D. student at RUAN University.
Today's speaker is Jin Jiang.
Jin Jiang is a PhD candidate at MIT.
Before joining MIT,
he obtained a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at NTU.
His research focuses on human decision-making
and how people interact with social media.
Especially when social media is full of real and fake news,
how do people interact with social media?
How does human behavior evolve into a large-scale social phenomenon?
These are the topics he is interested in.
He will use different theories and research methods
to explore his research interests.
Today, we invite him to talk about
the topic of persuasion,
strategic news sharing,
and social media.
Without further ado,
let's welcome Jin Jiang to give his presentation.
Jin Jiang, the floor is yours.
Thank you Kao-Hsien for the introduction.
Hello everyone.
I am currently studying at MIT.
This is my last year.
Today, I would like to introduce my project,
Persuasion, News Sharing and Cascade on Social Networks.
This is a joint work with my postdoc, Amir Ajalloh,
and my advisor, Ali Jawadbhai.
I am currently studying at the Engineering School.
However, I focus on Economic Theory.
Let's get started.
Ever since social media was invented,
people have changed the way they consume news.
One-fifth of Americans say
they usually receive news from social media.
Social media also promotes peer-to-peer interaction.
It also accelerates the flow of information.
We also found that
on social media,
you are passively receiving information.
Your friends decide to share news with you
or these algorithms promote news to you.
They subjectively choose to receive news from you.
On social media,
they want to make money.
When they distribute advertisements,
they may also amplify misinformation on the platform.
Today, I want to study
why people share news.
This is a very important question in the academic world.
Do people share news to tell others
or express their opinions?
Or do they want to find a peer?
Or do they want to persuade others?
In addition,
what kind of news
will be popular on social media?
For example,
what is the impact of credibility?
How does it affect
the characteristics of society?
From an economist's perspective,
some psychologists study
whether there is any behavioral bias.
Political scientists focus on misinformation
and political influence.
In the case of two parties,
they may be more willing to share
news related to their party.
How do they view news related to their party?
Is it more credible or less?
In this field,
they still rely on CS to help.
They still do computational things.
My question today is
based on a question.
If the motivation of sharing news
is to get your followers closer to you,
what will happen?
This model is a what-if question.
If the motivation is to get your followers
closer to you,
what kind of news will you share?
And what kind of news
will be popular in what kind of society?
OK.
As I said,
I'm using an economist's perspective
to answer this question.
Next, I will talk about this model
using the so-called competition theory.
In addition,
this work has been submitted
to the Journal of Economics Theory.
There is a link of SSR here.
If you are interested in the journal version,
please scan the QR code.
First, I will talk about
some major assumptions of this model.
Of course, we will consider a society
where everyone has a different view.
We are not all the same.
We are all left-wing or right-wing.
We all have different views.
Everyone hopes that
their peers' views are similar to theirs.
In addition,
the word persuasion we use here
means that
you give others an objective information,
a new information,
to influence their belief.
When I talk about persuasion,
I mean this.
In addition,
when sharing,
there will be some costs.
You can think of it like this.
When I was scrolling my phone,
I suddenly felt like
I wanted to spread this news.
I thought about it.
You were scrolling your phone,
and then you suddenly stopped.
The model has a small cost.
Because of this small cost,
we call it
strategic substitute in economics.
When others do this,
you don't want to do it
because you think others will do it for you.
In order to save that cost,
you may think that
if others have spread this news,
I don't need to spread it.
In addition,
I will apply this model to a society
with two-party differentiation.
In a society with two-party differentiation,
what will cause
inaccurate news
to spread
further than accurate news?
OK.
Sorry, can I ask a question?
Can I interrupt?
It's OK.
We should be fine.
I want to ask
the relationship between 2 and 3.
Because
if I share something
on social media,
I hope
that I am in the same class.
At this time,
the persuasion we talk about
seems to be different from
the usual persuasion we imagine.
For example,
if I am in the same class,
and I post something,
my understanding will be
or I will hope
they will accept it.
There is not much persuasion.
Usually,
the persuasion we imagine
is that those people
may be neutral
or even have a different
point of view
from me.
Then I share
some new information
to convince them
to join my camp.
So,
if
your model
is that
everyone wants to
stay in the same class,
then the persuasion
will be
relatively weaker.
Sorry,
I may not have explained
the second point.
The second point is not
that you want to be in the same class,
but that
my motivation is
that I hope
other people
have the same idea as me.
Oh,
I see.
So,
you hope
other people's ideas
are the same as yours.
Oh,
I see.
So,
I am just explaining.
Okay,
thank you.
Sorry,
I didn't understand.
It's okay.
I have a question.
Okay.
Does the persuasion
communication mechanism
here
matter
one-to-one
or one-to-many?
Oh,
that's a good question.
So,
the persuasion here is
because
our model
is more like
Twitter.
So,
you want to say
once I share this news,
all your friends
will see it.
Yes,
it's a simple
something
called broadcast.
Once I share it,
I can...
And I know
all my friends
will see it.
So,
there will be
a strategic substitute
because
others can broadcast.
Yes.
Okay,
I see.
Yes.
Yes,
that's a good question.
So,
you don't have to
choose
who you want to
share it to.
I just decide
to share it
and I know
all my followers
will see it.
Yes.
Okay.
And
here
is a
broad picture
about
our main
result.
First,
of course,
we designed
the equilibrium
and
it includes
identifying
everyone
sharing news.
So,
this is
the motivation
of persuasion.
But,
if you decompose it
and analyze it,
you will find that
people who are
more extreme
will want
to
share news
more actively.
And,
of course,
sharing news
is aligned
with my ideas.
If I am
a right-wing extremist,
I will
share
right-wing news.
I won't
share
left-wing news.
Another one is
persuasiveness of news.
Once I
share news,
I can change
people's
beliefs.
For example,
if I keep
sharing news,
no one will
believe it
and no one
will change
their ideas,
why should I
share news?
The last one is
strategic substitute.
When you
share news,
you will
evaluate
how many
people
are sharing
news
under
equilibrium.
Then,
you will
think that
most people
will hear
the news
so I don't
need to share it.
These are
the three main
components.
Can you
clarify
the concept
of
equilibrium?
Oh,
the concept
of
equilibrium
is that
under
this model,
you
predict
what
others
are doing.
Then,
under
your prediction,
you
optimize
your behavior.
If
everyone
goes to
the supermarket
to buy
everything,
I will
also go
to the
supermarket
to buy
everything
and go to
the supermarket
to buy
things.
So,
under
your
prediction,
you will
do
the best
behavior
for you.
At the same time,
under
your
prediction,
you will
optimize
your
behavior.
So,
under
this kind
of interaction,
it reaches
equilibrium.
In this
case,
no one
will
change
their
behavior.
So,
it gradually
reaches
equilibrium.
It's not
gradually
reaching
equilibrium,
but
it's
a
very
basic
assumption.
It's
not an
assumption,
it's
a
game.
In
the
game,
it's
like
playing
poker.
I will
think of
the
moves
and
I will
think of
how to
resist
them.
If
I
predict
your
behavior,
under
equilibrium,
I will
think of
how to
react.
No one
will
change
their
behavior.
It
reaches
a balance
of
resistance.
So,
we
need to
make it
equilibrium.
I see.
I have a
question.
For example,
if I
don't
talk,
but
the other
person
talks or
doesn't
talk,
it's better
for me.
So,
I will
talk.
If the
other person
talks or
doesn't
talk,
it's
better for
me.
I see.
Thank you.
I have a
question
about
equilibrium.
When
you
discuss
individual
differences,
does everyone
look different?
In
Econ,
they call
it
type.
What
type are
you?
You
can consider
individual
differences,
but
Econ
often
asks
whether
you
know
individual
differences.
