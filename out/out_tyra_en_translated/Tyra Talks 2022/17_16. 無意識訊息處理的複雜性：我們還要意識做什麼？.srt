00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome to today's TerraTalk. I am the host for today, Zhang Yanyong. Today, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming, a physical psychologist, to introduce his research interests to us.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today's research topic is the complexity of unconscious processing. What else do we need to be conscious of?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Before starting today's lecture, let me introduce Shaoming first. Shaoming graduated from the Department of Psychology of NTU. After obtaining a degree, he obtained a Doctoral Degree in Neuroscience from Duke University, Singapore National University Medical School.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
After obtaining a Doctoral Degree in Singapore National University Medical School, he came to the University of California, L.A. to do post-doctoral research.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
For most of his research, he asked the question, what is consciousness? Can we process unconscious information? What is the relationship between attention and consciousness?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In order to answer these questions, he spent a lot of time designing experiments. His research tools include psychological and physical methods, magnetic reflection, and recently he has also started to use a brain map and eye tracking devices.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Before we welcome Dr. Hong Shaoming, I would like to ask everyone to mute their microphones so that our speakers can hear our applause.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's give a round of applause to thank Shaoming for bringing us today's lecture.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you want to explain behind the experiment? What do you want to explain? I would suggest that you pause between the entire research and let everyone ask questions. You can ask more details, etc.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If there are no questions, let's start.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As Dr. Hong mentioned, today we are going to talk about the complexity of unconscious processing.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the end, I want to spend a little time to discuss if I can prove that unconscious processing is really very complicated.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What do we want to do with consciousness? Why don't our brains be like a computer? We receive an input, process it, and then throw the output out.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We don't need to be surprised by the outside world. Why do our brains need to be surprised by the outside world?

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In the end, there will be a little discussion.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As usual, I usually define what consciousness is before I talk. At least what is consciousness in this framework of discussion?

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The consciousness I want to discuss is basically related to the content, not the state.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
These two are more common.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The meaning of the content is, for example, if I pick up this cup now, I don't know if you can see me.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Anyway, when I pick up the cup and I am conscious of this cup, it means that this cup has entered my consciousness.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The state is, for example, I am very bored now, and after five minutes you may fall asleep.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
After you fall asleep, before you have a dream, you are in an unconscious state.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The state is not what we are going to talk about today.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's all about the sensory stimulus that didn't enter your consciousness.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The consciousness we are going to talk about today is also focused on visual awareness.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We often talk about visual awareness.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I will mix visual awareness with consciousness.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When I say consciousness, I am basically talking about visual awareness in this talk.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The experiments I will show you later and the research I usually do are mostly focused on the visual level.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It doesn't mean that these things can't be discussed in the sense of hearing or touch.

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's just that today's focus is on visual awareness.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why am I interested in the study of unconscious processing?

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
One of the points is that according to the information theory,

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
they have a little estimate of the amount of information we receive every second of our eyes and the content we can probably realize.

35
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The amount of information that the eyes can receive is about 10 to 80 bits, so it's a lot.

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We can receive so much information every second.

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But the content of our real consciousness is a bit controversial.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's about a few dozen to a few hundred, up to a thousand bits per second.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can see a very, very, very big difference.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Simply put, of course, the message is transmitted.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
From the moment your eyes receive the message to the moment you realize it,

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
a lot of information is lost.

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Another possibility is that when we process external information in the brain,

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
even if we process it, the information has never entered our consciousness.

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But it's still processed by our brain, and it might still affect our behavior.

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What I'm interested in is what kind of information these messages are.

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What kind of unconscious content can the brain process?

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What kind of information can affect our behavior after processing?

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Today's menu is very simple.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm talking about three things.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
First, I'm going to talk about some early research.

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to talk about some early research.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want to convince you that a lot of things we think we've seen,

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
or we think we've realized,

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
like the two words I just said, I'm going to mix them up.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We don't actually realize or see these things.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
These are classic psychological or intellectual research.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Second, I'm going to talk about my main research.

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do we just ignore the things we don't see?

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We found in a lot of research that the information we don't see,

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the information we don't realize,

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
your brain can still process it, and it can further affect your behavior.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Finally, let's spend some time talking about why we need to see,

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
why we need to be aware of,

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
why we need to feel the outside world,

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
why we need to have experience.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can feel it from the use of label symbols,

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
from the first to the third,

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
which is more and more speculative.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The third is basically my own personal guess.

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're welcome to jump in and discuss.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For the preliminary part,

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm going to spend some time convincing you that a lot of things we think we've seen,

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but we haven't.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The first is a very common example.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When we look at a picture,

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
we intuitively think that our visual system or our eyes

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
are like a camera or a camera.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We look at all the details.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For example, if you look at this picture now,

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
you'll see an animal in the middle,

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
a lot of flowers and grass,

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and I've seen a lot of details.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The next thing I'm going to show you

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
is a bit like what we used to play when we were kids.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's called...

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I kind of forgot what it's called now.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But anyway,

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
what I'm going to show you is that I'm going to move this picture

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to one of the places,

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and then I'm going to move this original picture and the changed picture

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
back and forth.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you look at this picture now,

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you can remember all the details,

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
or you can capture all the details in your eyes.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Once I move it,

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you should be able to see it very clearly.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's try to see if you can see it.

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
At this time,

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we're going to use the YES function we just talked about.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There should be a hand symbol on the far left of your screen.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When you see

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
where these two pictures are different,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
please press YES right away to let me know.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, let's get started.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
These are two different pictures.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's one little thing that's different.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We have a person who is very good at it.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I saw it in an instant.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, then...

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He pressed NO again later.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So now it looks like everyone hasn't seen it yet.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll give you another ten seconds.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then I'll announce the answer.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, some people saw it.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Great.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then I'll announce the answer.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The answer is here.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This point is different.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is called change blindness.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What does this mean?

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When we think our visual system

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
sees the outside world,

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
it will actually capture all the details.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's not.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your visual system will actually ignore a lot of details.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What we think we see is actually not what we see.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So when I make a little change,

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll show you what's the difference between the two pictures.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You actually can't find it.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, that's the first example.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The second example,

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
in fact, it's still the same.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, that's the first example.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The second example,

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in fact, it's still change blindness.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I think this example is very cool.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a progressive change blindness.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, this is actually a video.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll play this video later.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It will change slowly.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's a dynamic thing.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Once you see any change,

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
please press YES right away.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, let's get started.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's actually a constant process of change.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You might think this is a static picture.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, it's a video.

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Do you see any difference?

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Because I've seen it many times.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now I can clearly see that

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it's not the same as it was at the beginning.

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, I'll give you five more seconds.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you see it?

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Some people started to see it.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, I'm going to stop here.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Our video has been broadcast here.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is what the video looks like at the beginning.

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And this is what it looked like just now.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can see that the color is very different.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is a progressive change blindness.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In fact, this thing is right in front of us.

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But such a big color change,

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
my visual system can't capture it.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Again,

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
many times we think

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
we have seen some changes in the outside world.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Or we actually see the outside world very clearly.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In fact, it may not be true.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's show you another more famous example.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want to broadcast the video first.

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
After the broadcast,

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll talk about what this phenomenon is.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What you have to do in this video is

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to count the people who are wearing white clothes.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Maybe some people have seen it here.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Because this is really very famous.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
People who study psychology must have seen it.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Anyway, others, you can try it first.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What you have to do later is

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to count the people wearing white clothes.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How many times have they played basketball?

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's that simple.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's get started.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know if you have successfully counted 15 times.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Now the key question is

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Did you see a big star on the screen just now?

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you see it, please press Yes.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If you don't see it, please press No.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I want to see your answers.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I will continue to broadcast the video.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It seems that half of the people here have seen it.

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Half of the people have seen it.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Half of the people have not seen it.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I will continue to broadcast the video.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's take a look at what happened in the middle of the video.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What happened in the middle of the video

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
when you were counting the people wearing white clothes?

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is a classic psychological phenomenon called

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Inattentional blindness.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For example, when your attention is focused on

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
counting the people wearing white clothes,

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
even if something strange happens in a very close place,

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you still can't see it.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can't bring these things into your consciousness.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is called Inattentional blindness.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You can't see these things without attention.

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This phenomenon is very famous.

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This phenomenon is called Invisible Gorilla.

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It is a visual stimulus that is very easy to see.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
However, under a slightly difficult situation,

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
this visual stimulus disappears in front of you.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Finally, I want to talk about a more recent experiment.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Although this experiment is very recent,

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the questions answered or the questions you want to answer

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
are related to something that has been discussed for many years

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in the field of neuroscience, psychology, and neuroscience.

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Is it true that our eyes feel those colors?

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let me put it this way. Is it true?

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In physiology, if you know,

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the amount of tracking cells around our eyes is

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
much less compared to our fovea,

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
which is right in the middle of the eye.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
In other words, if you look at it from a physiological point of view,

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the things we see around our eyes should not be very saturated.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The color we see should not be very saturated.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a little blurry and black.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But subjectively, we don't feel it.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Subjectively, we think,

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I also see the color next to it.

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
For example, there is a lake next to me.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I also see the color of that lake.

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Our subjective experience seems to be a little inconsistent

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
with the evidence in physiology.

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In the past few decades,

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
there have been many experiments that want to explain to everyone that

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you feel like you can see the color of your corner of the eye.

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In fact, it is not necessary.

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This experiment was published two years ago.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Basically, the whole process of the experiment

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is very similar to the traditional experiment.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's just that they used a VR system.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The question they want to ask is,

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
if you say you can see the colors around your eyes,

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
why don't I change it secretly?

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you can see those changes,

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that means you can really see it.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Because you really read those colors.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you can't see it,

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
maybe the colors you see around your eyes and corner of your eyes

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
are not as rich as you think.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Their method is very simple.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a VR, a virtual reality goggle.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
After putting on the goggles,

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will ask them to look at a scene.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
For example, here is a rural scene.

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Some small houses and so on.

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They don't have to do anything.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Their job is,

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I might give you a few seconds.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're just looking around.

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In the last trial,

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
they will slowly turn the places

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
outside your eyes into black and white.

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The amount of changes will be from the most difficult to the simplest.

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The simplest is 10 degrees.

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The most difficult is 32.5 degrees.

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
32.5 degrees is the center of your eyes.

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
About 30 centimeters out of your hand,

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
there is color in the middle circle.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The rest is colorless.

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So even the least obvious situation

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is obvious to us.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you imagine that

276
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the 30-centimeter circle in front of you is colored,

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and everything else is black,

278
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
will you notice it?

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
People instinctively say yes.

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How many people noticed it at this time?

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
About 20%.

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So about 80% of people didn't notice it.

283
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Only the 32.5-degree corner in the middle is colored.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The rest is not colored.

285
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The rest is not colored.

286
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Most people will say,

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I didn't see it.

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's the same as before.

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There is color.

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's normal.

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This once again proves that

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
what we thought we saw,

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
for example, in this situation,

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is the color of the corner of our eyes.

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We really didn't see it.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Because if we didn't see it,

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
once it's changed,

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
we should be able to notice the change.

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But we can't.

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Through these four different demonstrations,

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to convince you that

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
in everyday life,

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
when you open your eyes,

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
many things you think you've seen,

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
you've noticed,

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
are actually not there.

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you are convinced that

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
many things in the outside world,

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
for example,

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we're talking about the visual world now,

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
many things in the visual world

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
haven't really entered our consciousness.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
For me,

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
the next instinctive question is

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
what happened to the things you didn't see?

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Have they been processed by our brain?

317
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Or did our brain choose to see some things

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and throw away the rest?

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This is the main part of today's lecture,

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
which is my own research.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Here,

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I've chosen two studies to discuss with you.

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The first study is related to the attraction of the face.

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We want to show that

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the attraction of the face,

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
even when you don't see that face,

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
can also be extracted.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It will affect how you distribute your attention.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The second study I want to talk about

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is a little more complicated,

331
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
which is the processing of language.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want to show that

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the processing of language,

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
even when you don't see the key word

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
or some sentences,

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you can still extract

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the words you can't see.

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
These grammatical errors

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
will be processed by your brain

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and further affect your behavior.

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's very abstract now,

342
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
but it will be clearer as time goes on.

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
First, let's talk about

344
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the study of the attraction of the face.

345
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why are we interested in this?

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The study of the attraction of the face

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
has a long history.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There are many theories.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Objectively,

350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
if we don't care about any theory,

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
from the perspective of a normal person,

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
how do we know that a face is beautiful?

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Objectively,

354
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
we need a kind of conscious deliberation.

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
In other words,

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we need to be mindful

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
of every face we see,

358
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and then say,

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I like this face.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's attractive to me.

361
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't like this face.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We need to look at each face,

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
spend some time and effort

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
to judge whether it's beautiful

365
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
or not.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
However,

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
this kind of intuitive thinking

368
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is contradictory to the results

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
or answers given by traditional psychology.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What does this mean?

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In fact,

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
psychology basically implies

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
a very automatic

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
or even very internal

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
or very small

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
mechanism to deal with the attraction of the face.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What does this mean?

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
For example,

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
many studies,

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
including recent or earlier studies,

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
found that

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
a very short presentation time,

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that is, I show you a face

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and the time is very, very short,

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
can let you judge

386
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
whether it's attractive to you or not.

387
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We're talking about short,

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
short to, for example,

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
this is 100 milliseconds,

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that's 0.1 seconds,

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and there are even some

392
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that are short to 13 milliseconds,

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that's 75 hertz of a computer frame,

394
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
which is a flash.

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In fact,

396
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
in such a short time,

397
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the audience can still judge

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
whether this face is beautiful

399
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
or not for him.

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This seems to imply that

401
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
we don't actually need

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
the so-called deliberation,

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
don't have to spend a lot of effort

404
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
to look at that face,

405
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
judge whether I like it or not.

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
In addition,

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
earlier baby studies also pointed out that

408
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
if you show the baby some pictures,

409
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
pictures of the face,

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the baby will prefer

411
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
a face that is more attractive to them.

412
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
These attractive faces

413
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
are of course also defined

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
by adults,

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
which is a more beautiful face.

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Show the baby

417
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and find that they will spend more time

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
staring at those

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
more beautiful faces for them.

420
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay,

421
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
this implies

422
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
whether to judge

423
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
or read something,

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
whether a face is beautiful,

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
is a very early

426
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
study,

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
or even an early process.

428
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay,

429
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
this is basically the basis

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
of our experiment.

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If there are

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
these past research foundations,

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
then we propose an assumption

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
that perhaps the attractiveness of the face

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
can be read by us

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
when you have not seen the face at all.

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How do we prove this?

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Here I have selected a few experiments

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
to explain to you.

440
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay,

441
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
this is our assumption.

442
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The first question we ask is

443
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
whether the beautiful face you can't see

444
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
has some advantages.

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What does this mean?

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
In fact, if you know a little bit about

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the psychology of the human face,

448
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
many studies say

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that beautiful faces

450
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
have many advantages.

451
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
For example,

452
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
in general,

453
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
people will spend more time

454
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
paying attention to these faces,

455
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
spending more time

456
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
looking at these faces.

457
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What we are actually asking here

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
is something similar.

459
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is it possible that

460
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
these beautiful faces

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
even if they are hidden by us,

462
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I will talk about

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
how we hide them later,

464
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
it will still show some advantages.

465
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The way we ask here is

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
whether these beautiful faces

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
after we hide them,

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
it will still be easier

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to enter our conscious state.

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In other words,

471
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
when in unconscious state,

472
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
its processing may be more efficient

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or simply faster.

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I will explain later

475
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
what is this

476
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
intraocular suppression.

477
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's talk about

478
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the general way we use

479
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
is to find a face database.

480
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Here I just want to tell you

481
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
that the faces we use

482
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
are all emotionally neutral.

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They are all faces

484
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that the collector has never seen.

485
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The important thing here is

486
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that these faces are relatively neutral.

487
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Some collectors even told me

488
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that sometimes our faces

489
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
look a little scary

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
because I don't want them

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
to have too much emotional information.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't want emotions

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to become another factor

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to affect our experiment results.

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Another point is

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in this experiment,

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
we have a main experiment.

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
After the main experiment,

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
we asked him to rate it.

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Is this face beautiful

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
or not beautiful?

502
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So in the main experiment,

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
they don't know

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
they shouldn't consider

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
anything related to

506
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
facial attractiveness

507
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
because it has nothing to do

508
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
with their work.

509
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is actually quite important.

510
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Let me explain

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
how we make things

512
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
invisible in this experiment.

513
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
How to make things invisible

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
to the collector.

515
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Conceptually,

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
he is actually...

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Please say.

518
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Someone is asking a question in the chat.

519
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you want to answer now

520
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
or will you leave a time later?

521
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I will ask a question

522
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
at this time.

523
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But I can...

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Wait a minute.

525
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is a real face.

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is a Karolinska Face Database.

527
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Karolinska is a face

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
made in Sweden.

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You can see

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
their clothes are the same.

531
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No makeup or light makeup.

532
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I will continue.

533
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I encourage you to...

534
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If it's a quick question like this,

535
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
but if it's a more complicated question,

536
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I encourage you to ask

537
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
between research and research.

538
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
OK.

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I want to talk about

540
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
how we make things invisible.

541
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The method we use

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
is a method

543
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
related to binocular rivalry.

544
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What does binocular rivalry

545
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
or binocular competition mean?

546
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
When your left eye

547
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and right eye

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
show very different images,

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
for example, a human face

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and a house,

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
or a straight line

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and a oblique line.

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Instinctively,

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
we think

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
what we see

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
is a stack of these two things.

557
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Maybe a human face

558
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and a house.

559
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's not.

560
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Our visual system

561
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
will choose one of them

562
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and let you see it.

563
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
For example, a human face.

564
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
After a while,

565
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you see a house.

566
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Then you see a human face

567
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and a house.

568
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This will continue.

569
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
In other words,

570
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
our visual system

571
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
will choose

572
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
an image on one eye

573
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and show it to you.

574
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The image on the other eye

575
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
is basically suppressed

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and invisible.

577
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is called binocular rivalry.

578
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Your eyes are always

579
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
in a state of rivalry.

580
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You don't usually feel it

581
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because what you see

582
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
is very close.

583
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There is a slight difference.

584
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But basically

585
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
they are fused together.

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So there is no rivalry.

587
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But occasionally

588
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
there can be a rivalry.

589
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If you are interested,

590
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I can talk about it later.

591
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But anyway,

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
when I show you

593
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
two very different things,

594
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
there will be

595
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a binocular rivalry.

596
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
In 2005,

597
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Nelson and Christophe Koch

598
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
found that

599
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
if your two eyes

600
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
are always in a state of rivalry,

601
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
what if I make

602
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
one of your eyes

603
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
look very strong,

604
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
very colorful,

605
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and keep flickering?

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like this.

607
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We call these things

608
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Mondrian's.

609
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This is related to

610
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the painting

611
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
by the Dutch painter.

612
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It was brought from there.

613
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Mondrian's

614
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
keeps flickering

615
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
on one eye.

616
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
On the other eye,

617
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you show it

618
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
what you really want to see.

619
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This experiment

620
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is a human face.

621
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What will happen?

622
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
At first,

623
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
this human face

624
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
will not be seen at all.

625
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We can hide

626
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
this human face

627
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
under the flickering

628
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
for a few seconds.

629
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
In this experiment,

630
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
we measure

631
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
something called

632
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
suppression time.

633
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How long

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
can this thing

635
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
hide in

636
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
our unconscious state?

637
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's assume

638
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that a beautiful face

639
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and an ugly face

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
can be hidden

641
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
for a different time.

642
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Why?

643
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because in the time

644
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we hide,

645
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
although you can't see the face,

646
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
but the processing

647
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
of a beautiful

648
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and ugly face

649
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
is different.

650
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This is our assumption.

651
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Once you understand

652
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
this concept,

653
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
the experiment itself

654
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
is very simple.

655
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Every time we present

656
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
a face,

657
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
maybe on the left or right,

658
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
there will be two groups

659
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
of flickering things

660
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to suppress

661
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the consciousness of the face.

662
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
After each trial,

663
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
we ask him

664
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
where the face appeared.

665
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Basically,

666
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we just make sure

667
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
he didn't trick us.

668
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
He really saw this face.

669
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
After this experiment,

670
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
we get

671
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
how long

672
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
each face

673
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
can be hidden

674
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in the unconscious state.

675
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Again,

676
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
we call it

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
suppression time.

678
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We have a lot of faces,

679
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but for me,

680
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
at this time,

681
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
after collecting this time,

682
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't know

683
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
which face is beautiful

684
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
or not.

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
After the experiment,

686
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
we will do

687
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
a rating

688
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that they didn't know at first.

689
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We want to judge

690
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
how beautiful

691
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
this face is.

692
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
We use all the faces

693
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
in the experiment

694
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and ask them to rate them.

695
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Next,

696
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
we will divide

697
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
these ratings

698
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
into less than 4

699
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
which is an ugly face,

700
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and more than 5

701
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
which is a beautiful face.

702
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You can see

703
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
there is a big difference

704
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
between the two

705
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
in the score.

706
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is a very simple homework.

707
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
After this homework,

708
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
we can know

709
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
which face

710
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
is beautiful

711
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
for the subject,

712
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and which face

713
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
is not beautiful

714
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
for the subject.

715
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You can imagine

716
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
that these two faces

717
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
are a little bit different

718
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
for each person.

719
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In this experiment,

720
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
the definition of

721
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
whether a face is beautiful

722
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
is subjective

723
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
by the subject.

724
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Everyone has

725
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a group of beautiful faces

726
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and a group of ugly faces.

727
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
With these two faces,

728
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
we can calculate

729
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
how much time

730
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
these two faces

731
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
need to spend

732
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
to enter

733
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
our conscious state.

734
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If you have

735
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
heard this once,

736
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I guess you

737
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
probably have some guesses.

738
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
At this time,

739
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I want to say

740
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that your guess

741
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
should be correct.

742
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Beautiful faces

743
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
usually enter

744
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
our conscious state

745
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
earlier and faster.

746
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
In fact,

747
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the analysis

748
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
is not so intuitive.

749
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Let me explain

750
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
what this figure

751
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
is talking about.

752
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can probably

753
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
look at the first column first.

754
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can see

755
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the two dots

756
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and then a bar.

757
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The red dot

758
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
is the time

759
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
a beautiful face

760
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
needs to spend.

761
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In other words,

762
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
the red dot

763
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
is about five seconds.

764
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The blue dot

765
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is the time

766
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
an ugly face

767
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
needs to spend.

768
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So,

769
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the first five seconds

770
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
are not enough

771
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
for the victim

772
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
to see the face.

773
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The bottom

774
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
is the difference

775
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
between the two dots.

776
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The y-axis

777
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
is on the right.

778
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What we are doing

779
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
here is

780
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
a three-part ANOVA.

781
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We also discussed

782
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
whether the gender

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of the victim

784
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and the gender

785
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
of the face

786
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
interact.

787
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In other words,

788
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
we wanted to see

789
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
if the beautiful face

790
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
is a girl,

791
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and whether it is

792
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
more useful

793
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
for the male victim.

794
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
On the other hand,

795
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
whether the beautiful face

796
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
is more useful

797
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
for the female victim,

798
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
we did not find that.

799
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So,

800
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I will not discuss

801
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the gender

802
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
of the beautiful face

803
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
in the future.

804
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Anyway,

805
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
what we found here

806
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is that

807
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the victim

808
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
usually

809
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
sees the beautiful face

810
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
earlier.

811
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This implies

812
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that

813
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
during the time

814
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the victim

815
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
cannot see the face,

816
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
the beautiful face

817
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
seems to be

818
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
processed more efficiently

819
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
or faster.

820
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So,

821
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
during this time,

822
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
we know that

823
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
the beautiful face

824
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
has a shorter

825
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
suppression time.

826
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
A longer

827
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
suppression time

828
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is like

829
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
what I just said.

830
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You will see

831
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
the beautiful face

832
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
earlier,

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
even if we hide it

834
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so that you cannot see it.

835
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Next,

836
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
we will

837
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
ask

838
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
why

839
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
this happens.

840
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Here,

841
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
we have

842
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
another assumption.

843
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Perhaps

844
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
even if you

845
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
do not see

846
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
the beautiful face,

847
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it will still

848
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
attract your attention.

849
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
This is like

850
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
what happens

851
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
when we face

852
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the beautiful face

853
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that you can see.

854
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The beautiful face

855
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
attracts your attention.

856
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How do we

857
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
prove this?

858
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We use a paradigm

859
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that world scientists

860
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
love to use.

861
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It is called

862
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Post-Nurse Cuing Paradigm.

863
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It does not matter

864
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
what the name is.

865
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What does this mean?

866
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Imagine

867
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
your homework.

868
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If you have done

869
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
any psychological homework,

870
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
there is always a cross

871
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
that you stare at.

872
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
After you stare at it,

873
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
if I give you a cue,

874
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
for example,

875
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it appears on the left.

876
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
For example,

877
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
this is a very handsome face.

878
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
After it appears on the left,

879
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I give you a target.

880
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
In theory,

881
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
your performance will improve.

882
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why?

883
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Because your cue

884
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
attracts your attention

885
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to that place.

886
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If the target

887
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
appears in the same place,

888
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
your performance will be better.

889
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
For example,

890
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
this is the case.

891
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You see a handsome face

892
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and then you see a target.

893
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then I ask you to judge

894
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
whether the orientation

895
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
is to the left

896
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
or to the right.

897
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Very normal,

898
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
very general

899
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
visual homework.

900
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What does the picture

901
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
below mean?

902
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The green area

903
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
is usually called

904
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Cuing Effect.

905
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This is what I call

906
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Cuing Effect.

907
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It means that

908
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
at the beginning,

909
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
about 200 milliseconds ago,

910
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the receiver's reaction

911
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
will become faster

912
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and better.

913
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The black dot

914
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
is the location that has been cued.

915
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Just like the situation

916
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
you just saw above.

917
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Its reaction speed

918
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
will be faster than

919
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the uncue location.

920
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
After about 300 milliseconds,

921
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
this mode will reverse.

922
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The receiver

923
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
in the place

924
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that has just been cued

925
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
will react slower.

926
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Then the place

927
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that has not been cued

928
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
will react faster.

929
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This thing

930
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
in this field

931
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
is usually called

932
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Inhibition of Return.

933
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It sounds complicated.

934
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's actually very simple.

935
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll show you a cue

936
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that appears on your left.

937
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
After a while,

938
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
it disappears.

939
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Your visual system

940
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
is looking for

941
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
a target

942
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
in the first 300 to 400 milliseconds.

943
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If you can't find anything,

944
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
your visual system

945
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
will say

946
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
that there's nothing there,

947
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
so we're going to

948
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
look for other places.

949
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So if the target

950
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
appears

951
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in the original place,

952
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
your performance will be worse

953
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because your visual system

954
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
has already started

955
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to look for other places.

956
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It even has a

957
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
suppression effect

958
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
on the original place.

959
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This is called Inhibition of Return.

960
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Why am I talking about this?

961
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It means that

962
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
this has something to do

963
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
with the result

964
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we're going to find later.

965
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What do we do

966
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in this experiment?

967
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Basically,

968
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
we show them

969
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
two faces at a time.

970
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
One is pretty,

971
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
one is not pretty.

972
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Then we use

973
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
this bright stimulation

974
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to suppress it

975
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
so that the receiver can't see it.

976
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Then let it make

977
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
a very simple judgment.

978
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The line is to the left,

979
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the line is to the right.

980
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is the same as

981
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
what I just said.

982
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's easy to judge

983
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
if this tilt

984
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is to the left or to the right.

985
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then we ask it a lot of questions

986
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to make sure

987
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
it really didn't see this face.

988
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Then we can also

989
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
do some calibration

990
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
to make sure

991
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
we can always show

992
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the correct brightness.

993
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you make your face

994
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
very bright,

995
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
sometimes they will

996
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
suddenly see that face.

997
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So we will have

998
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
a trial-by-trial

999
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
calibration.

1000
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
If you're not interested in this,

1001
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
it doesn't matter at all.

1002
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We do a lot of color balance.

1003
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The only thing you need to know here

1004
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
is that you can see

1005
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
this cold face is black and white.

1006
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because we even

1007
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
remove the color.

1008
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We don't want the color

1009
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to affect the result of the experiment.

1010
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Then we adjust the brightness

1011
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to the average brightness

1012
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
of the ugly face

1013
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and the pretty face.

1014
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
At this time,

1015
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
you can guess

1016
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that after seeing

1017
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
a pretty face

1018
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
or an ugly face

1019
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
that you can't see,

1020
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
which side

1021
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
of your performance

1022
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
will be better?

1023
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Instinctively speaking,

1024
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
it seems that

1025
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
you see a pretty face

1026
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and your attention

1027
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
is drawn to it

1028
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and your performance

1029
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
will be better.

1030
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
In fact, we found that

1031
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
it's the other way around.

1032
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The red dot

1033
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
is the visual performance

1034
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
of the invisible pretty face

1035
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
that they can't see

1036
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
after they see it.

1037
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The visual performance

1038
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
of the visual work

1039
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
is the red dot.

1040
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The blue dot

1041
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
is the performance

1042
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
after they see

1043
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the ugly face.

1044
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You can see

1045
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that most collectors

1046
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
have the same pattern.

1047
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
After they see

1048
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
a pretty face,

1049
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
their performance

1050
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
will obviously deteriorate.

1051
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There is a pretty obvious result

1052
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
overall.

1053
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Here is my explanation.

1054
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
This is what I just told you

1055
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
about the Inhibition of Return.

1056
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is a

1057
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
long-distance explanation.

1058
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Simply put,

1059
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
the time it takes

1060
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
for us to show the human face

1061
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
to the collector

1062
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
to see the real target,

1063
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
which is the thing

1064
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
on the left and right,

1065
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is more than one second.

1066
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It's very long

1067
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and falls into

1068
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the Inhibition of Return.

1069
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We think

1070
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
it's possible that

1071
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
after the collector

1072
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
sees the pretty face,

1073
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the target doesn't show up.

1074
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He has gone somewhere else

1075
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and the target only shows up.

1076
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So his performance

1077
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
will deteriorate.

1078
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Whether it deteriorates

1079
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
or improves,

1080
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it means that

1081
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the pretty face

1082
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
has attracted

1083
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
some kind of attention

1084
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
to you.

1085
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's the first point.

1086
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The second point is that

1087
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
there may be

1088
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
another form of

1089
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
attention

1090
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
here.

1091
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It means

1092
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
some kind of

1093
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
feature-based attention.

1094
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What does this mean?

1095
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
When the invisible

1096
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
pretty face

1097
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
appears,

1098
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
your attention

1099
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
may be placed

1100
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
on that face,

1101
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
on that pretty face.

1102
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
At this time,

1103
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
if I ask you to do

1104
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
another assignment,

1105
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
it's hard for your attention

1106
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to be drawn

1107
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
from that pretty face

1108
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to that invisible face.

1109
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So your performance

1110
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
will deteriorate.

1111
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This is also a possibility.

1112
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's a bit like

1113
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
in your daily life.

1114
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If you see

1115
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I really don't want to

1116
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
mention Jin Cheng-wu.

1117
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
If you see

1118
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Xin Yuan-jie

1119
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
walking past you,

1120
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
at the same time

1121
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
he asks you to do

1122
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
another thing,

1123
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you may be distracted

1124
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
by him.

1125
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The performance

1126
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
of the assignment

1127
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
you do

1128
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
will deteriorate.

1129
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
This is also a

1130
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
possible phenomenon.

1131
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
These are two different

1132
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
possibilities

1133
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
that can explain

1134
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the results here.

1135
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I promise you

1136
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
not to talk about

1137
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
too much control.

1138
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'll just talk about one.

1139
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
One possibility

1140
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
is that

1141
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
maybe between

1142
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
a pretty face

1143
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and an invisible face,

1144
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
for example,

1145
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the skin condition

1146
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
is a bit different,

1147
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
or the hair volume

1148
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
is a bit different.

1149
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So these

1150
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
more local things

1151
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
actually determine

1152
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
our results.

1153
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Our approach

1154
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
is to turn

1155
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
our face over.

1156
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If our experiment results

1157
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
are really determined

1158
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
by these local things,

1159
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
our experiment results

1160
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
should disappear.

1161
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Indeed,

1162
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
if it is determined

1163
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
by these local things,

1164
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
our experiment results

1165
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
should look the same.

1166
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
If it is determined

1167
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
by the face,

1168
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the result will remain.

1169
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You can see

1170
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
when we copy,

1171
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
only when the face

1172
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
is upright

1173
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
will we find

1174
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
this phenomenon.

1175
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
As long as the face

1176
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
is turned over,

1177
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you can see

1178
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
that his hair

1179
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and other features

1180
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
are still there,

1181
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
but the result

1182
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
disappears.

1183
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
This proves

1184
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that this is

1185
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
really a human face phenomenon.

1186
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
In conclusion,

1187
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
if we hide

1188
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
these attractive faces

1189
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that are attractive

1190
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to you,

1191
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
these pretty faces

1192
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
will be easier

1193
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to enter

1194
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
our medical content.

1195
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Our theory

1196
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
is to imply

1197
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that the brain

1198
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
deals with

1199
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
these attractive faces

1200
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
more quickly

1201
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and efficiently

1202
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
when they are

1203
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
unconscious.

1204
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
On the other hand,

1205
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
if we hide

1206
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
this face

1207
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
so that the recipient

1208
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
can't see it,

1209
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
we find that

1210
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the face

1211
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
they can't see

1212
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
if it is attractive

1213
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
can still

1214
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
affect our attention

1215
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and further affect

1216
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
their next

1217
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
very simple

1218
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
visual performance

1219
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
behavior.

1220
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I hope

1221
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that these

1222
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
tips

1223
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
have convinced you

1224
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
that attractive faces

1225
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
are not only

1226
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
easy to deal with

1227
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in daily life

1228
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
but also

1229
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
affect our behavior.

1230
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Even when I hide

1231
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
this face

1232
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and you can't see it,

1233
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
it still changes

1234
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
your behavior.

1235
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Let me pause

1236
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
here

1237
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
to see if

1238
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
there are any questions.

1239
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There are some questions

1240
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in the chat.

1241
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You may...

1242
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yes, I can see them.

1243
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Let me see.

1244
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I just saw

1245
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Zhang Yanyong

1246
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
say,

1247
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Wait, that's me.

1248
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Um...

1249
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Okay.

1250
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Let me start

1251
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
with this one.

1252
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
If the recipient

1253
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
says there is no emotional face...

1254
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Say there is no emotional face

1255
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
is a little scary.

1256
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh, okay, okay.

1257
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So this

1258
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
emotion

1259
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
in this...

1260
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
These faces

1261
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
have no emotion.

1262
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This is

1263
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
defined by

1264
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
the creator

1265
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
of the face database.

1266
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
When they create

1267
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
these faces,

1268
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
there are many situations.

1269
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So you can

1270
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
take out

1271
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
a happy face

1272
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
from the face database

1273
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or a sad face

1274
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
or an angry face

1275
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
from the face database.

1276
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I take out

1277
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
a neutral face.

1278
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So in other words,

1279
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
when doing this experiment,

1280
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
if the recipient

1281
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
tells me

1282
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
he feels

1283
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
very strong emotions

1284
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in these faces,

1285
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I will take

1286
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
the recipient away.

1287
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I hope

1288
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that answers

1289
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
the question.

1290
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So...

1291
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
This is

1292
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
a very good question

1293
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
about image.

1294
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Because there is

1295
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
an early study

1296
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that found that

1297
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
a...

1298
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They use...

1299
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What they do

1300
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
is more...

1301
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
More...

1302
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Interesting.

1303
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They show

1304
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the naked body

1305
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
to everyone.

1306
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They found

1307
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
that

1308
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the naked body of a girl

1309
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
has an effect

1310
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
on the attention

1311
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
of the male recipient.

1312
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This is

1313
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
similar to our paradigm.

1314
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
He can't see

1315
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
the naked body.

1316
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But they found

1317
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that they have

1318
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
an effect on attention.

1319
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The naked body of a man

1320
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
has an effect

1321
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
on the female recipient.

1322
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They also found

1323
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that the naked body of a man

1324
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
has an effect

1325
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
on...

1326
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The male

1327
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
gay recipient

1328
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
also has an effect.

1329
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So your image

1330
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
will determine

1331
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
which visual material

1332
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
affects you.

1333
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In our research,

1334
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
we didn't ask

1335
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
this question.

1336
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Because we didn't even

1337
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
see the effect of gender.

1338
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And we don't

1339
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
have that many people.

1340
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So...

1341
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I can't answer

1342
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
if it has anything to do

1343
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
with image.

1344
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yes.

1345
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Let's

1346
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
look at the next question.

1347
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Uh...

1348
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This is

1349
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
a question from Zhang Yiping.

1350
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
How long

1351
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
does it take

1352
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to hide different visual materials?

1353
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Which visual material

1354
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
will be found?

1355
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yes.

1356
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
One of the key points

1357
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
is the visual material...

1358
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll tell you

1359
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
the whole question.

1360
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
My method

1361
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is to hide

1362
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
things

1363
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
so that

1364
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
people can't see them

1365
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and become blind.

1366
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then throw in

1367
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the visual material

1368
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and see which

1369
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
visual material

1370
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
comes out first.

1371
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That's right.

1372
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But the key point

1373
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
is that these visual materials

1374
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
should be

1375
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
two different

1376
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
visual materials.

1377
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
For example,

1378
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
the first example

1379
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is the face

1380
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and the house.

1381
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That...

1382
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
can affect

1383
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
the sound

1384
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we explain

1385
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
too much.

1386
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Because it may

1387
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
not be attractive.

1388
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It may just be...

1389
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
For example,

1390
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
your visual system

1391
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
may like square things

1392
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
or round things

1393
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
or something like that.

1394
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So the general practice

1395
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
is that your visual material

1396
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
should look a bit like.

1397
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
In the next experiment,

1398
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
it will actually

1399
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
talk about similar things.

1400
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
For example,

1401
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you want to control

1402
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
his...

1403
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Like in this experiment,

1404
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
we control the color

1405
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or its brightness,

1406
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
etc.

1407
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Let us...

1408
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The only change

1409
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
in the sound

1410
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
is only one or two.

1411
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This way,

1412
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
we can know

1413
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
that in the end

1414
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
if they are processed

1415
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and there is a time difference,

1416
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
what is the time difference

1417
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that affects?

1418
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Then the blind spot

1419
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
of the visual

1420
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
is that

1421
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
we have another experiment

1422
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that is trying this thing.

1423
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OK.

1424
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Maybe we can

1425
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
talk offline

1426
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
later.

1427
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The material of the eyes

1428
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is not,

1429
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but...

1430
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
In fact,

1431
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
at the beginning

1432
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of the introduction,

1433
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I said that

1434
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I have been doing eye movements recently

1435
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
because I am interested

1436
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
in how to use eye movements

1437
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to further study

1438
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
my past research.

1439
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
If you are interested,

1440
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
we can talk later.

1441
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Why are there

1442
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
so many questions?

1443
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Sorry.

1444
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Attractiveness

1445
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is asked

1446
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
by subjective rating.

1447
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Attractiveness

1448
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of a baby.

1449
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
In fact,

1450
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I was not very accurate

1451
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
just now.

1452
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Attractiveness

1453
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
is defined

1454
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
by adults first.

1455
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So,

1456
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for example,

1457
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
in the study

1458
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
of a baby,

1459
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it is said that

1460
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
it will find

1461
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
a group

1462
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
of faces

1463
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
that adults

1464
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
think are beautiful

1465
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and some faces

1466
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
that adults

1467
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
think are not beautiful

1468
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
to show the baby.

1469
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So,

1470
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the interesting thing

1471
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
is that

1472
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
these children

1473
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
may be born

1474
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
a few months

1475
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
or even younger.

1476
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They have not yet

1477
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
learned

1478
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the social rules

1479
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
of the situation,

1480
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
but they will

1481
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
pay more attention

1482
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to the more beautiful

1483
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
face

1484
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and spend

1485
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
more time

1486
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
looking at it.

1487
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This is why

1488
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
some people want to claim that

1489
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
face-to-face

1490
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
or face-to-face

1491
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
attractiveness

1492
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
may be a very early

1493
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
process.

1494
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
In fact,

1495
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I do not have to

1496
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
learn

1497
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to achieve it.

1498
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yes,

1499
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
then,

1500
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
is it related to

1501
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
symmetry?

1502
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
In this experiment,

1503
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I did not manipulate,

1504
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
but

1505
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
many studies

1506
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
on face-to-face

1507
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
attractiveness

1508
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
will discuss

1509
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
whether the face

1510
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is symmetrical,

1511
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
for example,

1512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
is your face

1513
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
a

1514
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
public face

1515
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
or an average face

1516
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
will greatly affect

1517
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
whether this face

1518
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
is beautiful or not.

1519
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
In my experiment,

1520
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
because

1521
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I did not want to manipulate

1522
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
how to make a face

1523
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
beautiful

1524
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
or how to make a face

1525
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
not beautiful,

1526
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
so my approach is

1527
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
to catch these faces

1528
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and let my collector

1529
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
judge whether they are beautiful or not.

1530
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
My guess is

1531
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
that if I can

1532
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
control the aspect ratio,

1533
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
for example,

1534
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the same face

1535
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and make it more symmetrical

1536
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
or more asymmetrical

1537
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
to affect its attractiveness,

1538
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
similar results

1539
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
should be replicated.

1540
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
OK,

1541
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
that's about it.

1542
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I will continue,

1543
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
otherwise we may not finish.

1544
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
OK.

1545
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
This is the first experiment.

1546
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I hope

1547
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I have convinced everyone

1548
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
that a face

1549
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
is actually

1550
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
when you do not see

1551
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
your brain

1552
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
can read a lot of

1553
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
relevant information.

1554
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The second is to talk about grammar.

1555
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
As I just said,

1556
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
this concept

1557
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
will be a little more

1558
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
complicated than

1559
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the previous one,

1560
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
but it is not really complicated.

1561
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I will talk about

1562
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
what I want to talk about

1563
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
grammar.

1564
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Generally speaking,

1565
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
grammar

1566
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
has a lot of

1567
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
different levels.

1568
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
For example,

1569
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
each word

1570
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
has a different

1571
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
lexical category.

1572
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It may be a verb,

1573
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
a noun,

1574
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
or a connected word,

1575
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
etc.

1576
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The grammar I'm talking about

1577
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
is

1578
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
when we read

1579
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a sentence,

1580
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
the ability to

1581
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
put different words

1582
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
in the right place.

1583
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Generally speaking,

1584
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we would think

1585
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
this is a high-level ability.

1586
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Why?

1587
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Because I need to

1588
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
calculate something,

1589
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I need to know

1590
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that this word

1591
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
should be in the first place,

1592
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that word should follow

1593
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
that word,

1594
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so it is a

1595
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
high-level ability.

1596
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
For example,

1597
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
if I show you

1598
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
some words now,

1599
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
these are very

1600
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
simple words,

1601
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
so you can see

1602
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
that I can understand

1603
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
every word,

1604
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
but I'm just

1605
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
arranging them now,

1606
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
so you don't understand

1607
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
what this sentence is for.

1608
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
If I want to understand it,

1609
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I usually need to

1610
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
arrange it in the

1611
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
right place.

1612
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Once it is in the

1613
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
right place,

1614
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
you may understand

1615
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
in a second

1616
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that this sentence

1617
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
is about this thing.

1618
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The question I want to

1619
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
ask in this experiment

1620
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
is that

1621
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
when our brain

1622
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
does not see

1623
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
these words,

1624
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
how do we

1625
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
get this information?

1626
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This is the

1627
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
main problem.

1628
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Then I will

1629
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
tell you about

1630
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
a series of

1631
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
research that

1632
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
we have done.

1633
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
In fact,

1634
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
when we study,

1635
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
of course,

1636
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
we don't use

1637
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
such a complicated sentence.

1638
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We can,

1639
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
but this is the

1640
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
first stage,

1641
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
so we use

1642
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
some simpler sentences.

1643
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I use some

1644
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
three-word sentences.

1645
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
These sentences

1646
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
are normal,

1647
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
correct,

1648
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and legally reasonable

1649
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
sentences.

1650
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
There is this

1651
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
subject,

1652
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
verb,

1653
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and the two verbs

1654
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
are not legal

1655
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
in English.

1656
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
These are the

1657
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
sentences we

1658
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
really use.

1659
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You can see

1660
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
birdseedworms and

1661
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
birdseeddrinks,

1662
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
so birds eat

1663
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and drink.

1664
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Drinking

1665
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
these two verbs

1666
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
together is

1667
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
an incorrect

1668
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
grammatical form.

1669
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
If anyone here

1670
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
is doing language

1671
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
or psychological

1672
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
language studies,

1673
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
we also control

1674
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
the font

1675
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
of these words

1676
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and their length

1677
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
to ensure that

1678
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
like we just

1679
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
talked about

1680
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
when we do

1681
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
these experiments,

1682
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
we can see

1683
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
if the lower

1684
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
or different

1685
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
faces

1686
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
have been

1687
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
properly controlled.

1688
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We just need to

1689
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
tell them that

1690
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
we have

1691
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
controlled the

1692
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
other faces.

1693
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
We want to

1694
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
make sure

1695
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that the main

1696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
difference between

1697
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
these two situations

1698
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is that

1699
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
one is

1700
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
legally reasonable

1701
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and the other

1702
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
is legally

1703
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
unreasonable.

1704
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The question

1705
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
is how

1706
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
do we prove

1707
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
that our

1708
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
brain

1709
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
can't see

1710
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
these keywords

1711
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and still

1712
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
be able to

1713
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
correct

1714
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
grammatical errors

1715
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
when we can't

1716
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
see them?

1717
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Our approach

1718
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
is very similar

1719
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
to what we

1720
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
talked about

1721
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
earlier.

1722
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Our approach

1723
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is to

1724
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
show the

1725
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
subject

1726
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the first

1727
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
two words

1728
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
so that

1729
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
they can

1730
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
clearly see

1731
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the first

1732
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
two words

1733
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
so that

1734
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
they can

1735
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
have some

1736
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
grammatical

1737
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
expectations.

1738
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
After

1739
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
this,

1740
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
we have

1741
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
some

1742
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
catch tasks

1743
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
to make

1744
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
sure that

1745
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the subject

1746
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
can see

1747
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the first

1748
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
two words

1749
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and

1750
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
make sure

1751
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
that

1752
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
the subject

1753
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
can read

1754
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the first

1755
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
two words

1756
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
in

1757
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
each trial.

1758
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The

1759
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
key point

1760
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is the

1761
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
detection

1762
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
task.

1763
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We are

1764
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
measuring

1765
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the suppression

1766
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
time.

1767
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
How long

1768
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
will it

1769
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
take for

1770
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the

1771
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
two

1772
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
words to

1773
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
be seen?

1774
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The

1775
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
red bar

1776
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
is the

1777
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
time it

1778
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
takes to

1779
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
see the

1780
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
word.

1781
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The

1782
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
red bar

1783
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
is the

1784
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
time it

1785
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
takes to

1786
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
see the

1787
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
word.

1788
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The

1789
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
red bar

1790
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
is the

1791
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
time it

1792
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
takes to

1793
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
see the

1794
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
word.

1795
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The

1796
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
time it

1797
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
takes to

1798
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
see the

1799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000


1800
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
word,

1801
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the

1802
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
difference in

1803
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
their

1804
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
reaction.

1805
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Is it

1806
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
really because of

1807
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
grammar?

1808
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
For example,

1809
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
if you look at

1810
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
the words we

1811
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
use,

1812
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
one word is

1813
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
always a

1814
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
verb,

1815
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
one word is

1816
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
always a noun,

1817
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
maybe the

1818
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
difference between

1819
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the two is

1820
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the verb and

1821
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
noun,

1822
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
or maybe the

1823
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
noun and

1824
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
the verb

1825
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
look a little

1826
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
different,

1827
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
so the

1828
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
effect should

1829
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
disappear after

1830
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
the grammatical structure

1831
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
of the sentence

1832
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
is destroyed

1833
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
because there is

1834
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
no grammar at

1835
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
this time,

1836
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
but you

1837
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
look at the

1838
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
following two

1839
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
words, the

1840
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
key word is

1841
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
actually the

1842
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
same.

1843
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
In these two

1844
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
experiments,

1845
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
our effect

1846
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
disappeared,

1847
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
which means

1848
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that we

1849
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
found that

1850
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
the phenomenon

1851
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
really needs

1852
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
that word to

1853
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
be hidden

1854
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
unconsciously,

1855
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that is,

1856
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
it is

1857
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
still the same

1858
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
key word,

1859
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
the effect will

1860
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
disappear.

1861
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The next

1862
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
question we ask

1863
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
is actually after

1864
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
several years,

1865
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the question we

1866
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
ask is that

1867
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
this kind of

1868
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
experiment seems to

1869
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
still rely on

1870
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
us to see

1871
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the grammar error

1872
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
in the end

1873
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
because the

1874
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
receiver sees

1875
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and then the

1876
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
reaction

1877
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
sees the

1878
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
reaction,

1879
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
so is there

1880
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
a possibility

1881
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
that we

1882
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
must see

1883
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
such an

1884
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
experiment result

1885
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
?

1886
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Is there

1887
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
a possibility

1888
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
that we can

1889
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
prove that the

1890
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
grammar error

1891
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
itself can

1892
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
really be

1893
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
independently

1894
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
processed

1895
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
unconsciously?

1896
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Our approach

1897
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
is that

1898
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
otherwise we

1899
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
hide the

1900
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
whole part of

1901
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the sentence

1902
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and then

1903
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
we will

1904
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
hide it

1905
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and then

1906
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
there will

1907
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
be a few

1908
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
advantages.

1909
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I will

1910
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
tell you later

1911
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
that our

1912
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
approach

1913
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
is to

1914
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
hide the

1915
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
real word

1916
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
or the

1917
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
fake word

1918
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
in English.

1919
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
At this

1920
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
time, you

1921
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
can see that

1922
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
there are

1923
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
some different

1924
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
conditions here,

1925
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
such as that

1926
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
it can be a

1927
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
grammatically

1928
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
reasonable word

1929
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
or it can be

1930
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
a grammatically

1931
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
unreasonable word

1932
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
or it is

1933
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
a fake word.

1934
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The

1935
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
fake word

1936
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
actually has

1937
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
nothing to do

1938
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
with our

1939
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
analysis,

1940
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
just that

1941
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
we have to

1942
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
balance the

1943
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
amount of

1944
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
words that

1945
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
he can't see

1946
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
if he can

1947
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
handle the

1948
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
two words

1949
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
that he can't

1950
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
see,

1951
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
half of the

1952
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
sentence,

1953
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
which may

1954
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
affect

1955
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
how he

1956
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
judges the

1957
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
grammatically

1958
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
reasonable and

1959
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
unreasonable

1960
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
words.

1961
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There are

1962
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
two points

1963
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
here.

1964
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The first

1965
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is that

1966
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
they can't

1967
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
see the

1968
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
words hidden

1969
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
in the

1970
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
front.

1971
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We have

1972
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
run some

1973
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
tests to

1974
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
see if

1975
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it has

1976
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
anything to

1977
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
do with

1978
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
grammar,

1979
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
so the

1980
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
point is that

1981
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
he can't

1982
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
see the

1983
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
words in

1984
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
front and

1985
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
he doesn't

1986
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
know if

1987
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
the key

1988
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
words are

1989
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
grammatically

1990
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
wrong or

1991
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
correct,

1992
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
but in

1993
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
this case

1994
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
we still

1995
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
find that

1996
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
when the

1997
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
word is

1998
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
wrong,

1999
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
its

2000
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
reaction

2001
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
speed

2002
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
is

2003
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
slow.

2004
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
In the

2005
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
earlier experiment,

2006
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
we found that

2007
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
if I let the

2008
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
recipient read the

2009
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
first half of the

2010
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
sentence,

2011
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
when the

2012
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
last word

2013
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
does not

2014
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
match the

2015
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
grammar of

2016
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the

2017
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
sentence,

2018
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
it will

2019
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
enter our

2020
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
conscious state

2021
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
earlier.

2022
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
This is

2023
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
a bit like

2024
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
the concept

2025
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
of discussing

2026
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
the face

2027
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
at the

2028
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
beginning .

2029
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
At this

2030
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
time,

2031
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
the words

2032
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that do not

2033
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
match the

2034
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
grammar will

2035
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
even be faster.

2036
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
On the

2037
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
contrary,

2038
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in the last

2039
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
experiment,

2040
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
we let you

2041
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
see that

2042
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
if you read

2043
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
a sentence

2044
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
that you

2045
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
can't

2046
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
see at

2047
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
the beginning

2048
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
,

2049
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
even if

2050
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
you don't

2051
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
know if

2052
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
the

2053
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
word is

2054
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
grammatically

2055
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
correct or

2056
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
wrong,

2057
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
your

2058
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
reaction

2059
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
will

2060
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
be faster.

2061
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
For some

2062
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
reasons,

2063
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
our brains

2064
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
tend to

2065
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
deal with

2066
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
grammatical

2067
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
errors more

2068
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
quickly.

2069
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Of course,

2070
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
there are

2071
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
various experiments

2072
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
in psychological

2073
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
linguistics

2074
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
.

2075
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
When you

2076
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
read something,

2077
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
if there is

2078
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
a grammatical

2079
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
error,

2080
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
it will

2081
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
become a

2082
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
more salient

2083
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
stimulus.

2084
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Sometimes it

2085
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
is more

2086
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
popular and

2087
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
we see it.

2088
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
However,

2089
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
this is the

2090
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
second experiment.

2091
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I hope that

2092
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
these experiments

2093
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
will convince you

2094
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
that the

2095
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
grammatical

2096
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
processing of

2097
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
sentences

2098
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
sounds like a

2099
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
relatively

2100
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
high-level

2101
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
cognitive process

2102
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that can also

2103
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
occur when we

2104
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
don't see

2105
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
words.

2106
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Let me

2107
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
answer a

2108
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
few more

2109
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
questions.

2110
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
There is a

2111
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
problem that

2112
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Chinese reading is

2113
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
less affected by

2114
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
order.

2115
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This is a

2116
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
good question.

2117
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I have not

2118
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
tested this experiment

2119
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
on Chinese

2120
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
users.

2121
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I have

2122
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
always wanted to

2123
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
try it.

2124
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There are

2125
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
two

2126
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
relative

2127
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
theories.

2128
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
One is that

2129
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Chinese reading is

2130
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
relatively less

2131
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
affected by

2132
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
order.

2133
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Word order

2134
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
is less

2135
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
important.

2136
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Perhaps this

2137
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
effect will not

2138
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
come out.

2139
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The other

2140
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
is that it

2141
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
still works

2142
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and is

2143
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
not

2144
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
affected by

2145
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
order.

2146
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It just

2147
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
doesn't

2148
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
affect us

2149
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
to read the

2150
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
sentence.

2151
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This does

2152
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
not mean that

2153
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the brain will not

2154
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
notice that

2155
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
there is a

2156
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
problem with

2157
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
the

2158
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
order.

2159
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The

2160
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
question I

2161
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
want to

2162
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
ask is

2163
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
whether it is

2164
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
logical to

2165
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
be

2166
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
educated

2167
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
by

2168
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
grammar

2169
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and

2170
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
cognitive

2171
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
behavior

2172
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
.

2173
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
This is the

2174
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
first experiment

2175
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I did as a

2176
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Ph.D.

2177
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
At first, I

2178
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
couldn't find

2179
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
any results.

2180
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Then I found

2181
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
that this may be

2182
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
a test of

2183
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
English ability.

2184
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It is possible

2185
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
that

2186
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
grammar is

2187
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
relatively

2188
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
detailed.

2189
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You may

2190
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
need a

2191
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
lot of

2192
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
things.

2193
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
For example,

2194
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
you may need

2195
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
native speakers

2196
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
to be able to

2197
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
distinguish the

2198
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
correct words

2199
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
from the

2200
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
wrong words

2201
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
.

2202
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Although I

2203
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
didn't do a

2204
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
formal test,

2205
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I agree that

2206
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
the degree of

2207
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
familiarity with

2208
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
this language

2209
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
or the

2210
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
degree of

2211
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
education in

2212
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
this language

2213
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
may greatly

2214
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
affect the

2215
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
results of

2216
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
this experiment

2217
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
.

2218
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
In other words,

2219
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
the interpretation

2220
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
of

2221
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yan Yong

2222
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
is right.

2223
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
After long

2224
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
training,

2225
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
you know

2226
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
what is

2227
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
legally

2228
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
reasonable and

2229
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
what is

2230
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
not

2231
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
.

2232
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
This is

2233
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
a bit

2234
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
complicated

2235
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
because

2236
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
everyone will

2237
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
discuss what

2238
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
can enter

2239
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
the unconscious

2240
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
from the

2241
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
conscious.

2242
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
A common

2243
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
example is

2244
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
driving.

2245
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
When you

2246
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
drive for the

2247
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
first time,

2248
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
everything is

2249
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
very conscious

2250
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
because you

2251
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
have to pay

2252
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
attention to

2253
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
what you

2254
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
should

2255
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
step on

2256
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
.

2257
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
After

2258
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
training,

2259
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the degree of

2260
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
familiarity will

2261
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
allow something

2262
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
that was

2263
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
supposed to be

2264
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
conscious to

2265
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
enter the

2266
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
unconscious process

2267
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
.

2268
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
In my

2269
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
imagination,

2270
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
this experiment

2271
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
is actually

2272
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
a bit

2273
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
similar to

2274
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
that process

2275
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
.

2276
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I have

2277
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
finished

2278
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
answering

2279
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
.

2280
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I am going

2281
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
to

2282
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
enter the

2283
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
last stage

2284
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
of

2285
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
today.

2286
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Before

2287
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that,

2288
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I hope I have

2289
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
convinced you that

2290
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
the attraction of the

2291
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
face and the

2292
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
processing of the

2293
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
sentence

2294
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
can be

2295
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
processed

2296
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
when you do

2297
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
not see the

2298
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
key material

2299
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
, which is

2300
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
the face

2301
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
or the

2302
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
character.

2303
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
In fact,

2304
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
we do more than

2305
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
this.

2306
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We also

2307
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
do, for

2308
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
example,

2309
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
the integration

2310
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
between

2311
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
vision and

2312
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
hearing,

2313
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
or the

2314
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
processing of

2315
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
meaning,

2316
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
which is

2317
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
the

2318
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
processing of

2319
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
meaning.

2320
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
We also

2321
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
found that

2322
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
if you see

2323
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
something you can't

2324
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
see,

2325
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
its reaction

2326
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
is different from

2327
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
the reaction

2328
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
you want to

2329
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
do next.

2330
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It will

2331
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
interfere with

2332
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
your next

2333
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
reaction.

2334
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Most of

2335
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
these are

2336
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
visual messages.

2337
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
