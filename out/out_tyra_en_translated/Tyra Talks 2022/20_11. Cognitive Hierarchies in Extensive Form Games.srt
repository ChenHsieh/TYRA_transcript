00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Thank you very much to the host and thank you very much to the audience for coming today to enjoy the light, and then I am Bo Xuan, and then I am going to talk about the topic here, although there are several English words here, but I think maybe if you are not doing economics, maybe these words, each word guess out what it means, but together do not know what it means, so I will slowly explain that is anyway, the editor will slowly know what I am doing.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What am I doing? Let's start by explaining the topic. First of all, what we are doing is games, so this is the game. I want to use a few minutes to briefly introduce what the theory of the game is, which is a more scientific introduction.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First of all, what is a game? In fact, when you see the game, you may think of online games, table tennis, scissor-paper, or something like that.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In fact, these are all included in this range. For us, the game is actually a mathematical way to describe a strategic environment where we are interacting with people.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:33,000
As I just said, it actually contains a lot of different situations, such as describing what we eat in our daily life, and we don't know what to eat, so we use scissor-paper to decide. This can also be described, or more complicated, such as a game of Go, which may not be able to play all day.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, it can also be described in such a game theory. It is very comprehensive, but basically it can be divided into two categories in our game. First of all, the first category is Normal Form. I'm not sure what Chinese should be called. Maybe it's called formal expression, but I'll just call it Normal Form.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In the Normal Form, all the players involved in the game all make a move at the same time. It's like scissor-paper. So if you don't know what I'm talking about, you can imagine the environment of scissor-paper. Everyone makes a move at the same time.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The other situation is what I'm going to talk about today, which is Extensive Form. All players make a move at the same time. It's like Go. Everyone makes a move, and then I make a move, and then someone else makes a move. Basically, the game can be divided into these two categories.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now I'm going to introduce the basic mathematical definition of these two categories. The following two videos are a bit dry. If you have any questions, you can ask me right away if you don't understand the mathematical symbols. First of all, let's look at Normal Form, which is the situation where everyone makes a move at the same time. In this situation, we can actually use three things in mathematics to define it.

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
First of all, we need to have a collection to say how many players there are now. For example, if two people are playing scissor-paper with me and Gao Xian, then this N is 1 and 2. 1 is me, 2 is Gao Xian.

11
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Next, we need to describe how many moves each person can make. So at this time, for each player i, I will use si to express the number of moves he can make. For example, in scissor-paper, everyone has three moves.

12
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Next, we collect all the people who can make a move into an array. For example, if there are N people, I will collect them into A1 to AN. Then we call it a strategy combination.

13
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Next, the third thing is that I know what strategy combinations there are, and I know how many people are playing. Next, I have to decide who wins and who loses. In this case, we need to use a function to express it. At this time, we call it a payoff function.

14
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So for each player i, this UI is actually a combination of moves from everyone to how many rewards you can get. For example, in scissor-paper, we are playing with Gao Xian. If I make scissors and he makes paper, I win. So in this strategy combination, what I get is 1 and what Gao Xian gets is 0.

15
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's like this. You can use these three elements to express a strategy environment where you make a move at the same time.

16
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In math, we want to predict what kind of result people will play in this situation. The mathematical prediction we proposed is basically that the most likely result to be played should be the most stable result. At this time, we use a concept called balance to say what is the most likely result.

17
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The concept of balance is actually that it is defined on a strategy combination. We will say that a certain strategy combination is a balance, which means that for each player, if I know what he does, I am not willing to change the move.

18
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So in this case, it means that this is a balance. So if it is expressed mathematically, we say that a strategy combination A is a simple strategy balance, which means that for each player, he actually uses this A-I, which means that it is a move used by players other than I.

19
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So in this case, it means that player I uses this A-I, which is actually better than any other move for his revenge. If this is true for each player, then we say that this is a simple strategy balance.

20
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to stop for a few seconds, do you have any questions? If not, I will continue to talk about another part.

21
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
OK, then I will continue.

22
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What we have just finished talking about is Normal Form. Next, we will talk about Extensive Form, which is the situation where everyone takes turns to make moves.

23
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So at this time, you think that it is actually very similar to the previous Normal Form in terms of mathematical structure. It is the same as having a combination to describe how many players there are. In addition, we also need a combination to describe the moves that everyone can make.

24
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But now everyone takes turns to make moves, so now there are three things left to describe. The first is who does what in what place.

25
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So this means that we have to describe all possible situations, and then in this case, who does what and what he can do.

26
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There are several different mathematical expressions, but here I use a more common mathematical expression to describe what I just said.

27
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:07,000
First of all, when talking about these notations, if you think there are a lot of mathematical symbols, you can imagine that this is a game of Go. Now N is 1 and 2, that is, there are black stones and white stones.

28
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then S is all possible places, so if it is a 19x19 chessboard, there are 361 possible points.

29
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The next first one is that we are describing all possible situations, which is actually all the chess pieces that are still in progress.

30
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That is, you may play half of the chess pieces or the chess pieces that have been played. We use a set called H, which actually represents history.

31
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This combination describes all possible situations, that is, half of the chess pieces, etc. I collect them all in this combination.

32
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So this combination is actually very large, and then each element in this combination actually means that the previous experience has been put in order.

33
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
For example, the first step of the black stone line is in Tianyuan, which is an element in the history, and now the white stone has put down another hand.

34
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
These things will be collected in this history.

35
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There is a relatively small set Z in this history set, and we call it Terminal History.

36
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So this is all the chess pieces that have been played, and I put them in this set.

37
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because by the time our revenge is based on this set.

38
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The second thing we have to decide is who is doing what in what situation.

39
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
First of all, who is it?

40
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That is to say, it is actually a function P, and then this function is from all possible chess pieces that have not been played.

41
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In the chess piece, it is printed to the player's collection, which means that this move should be the turn of the black chess or the white chess.

42
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So this is P, this function is helping us.

43
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then the third thing is what.

44
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is, in every situation, I know that this person is now the turn of the black chess.

45
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What actions can be done?

46
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then I will use Row as a Correspondence to describe.

47
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What he printed here is a piece of paper from the history set to a possible action set.

48
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It means that this description says what I can do now.

49
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Then how do we decide who wins and who loses?

50
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It is the same as using our familiar UI to show.

51
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like this thing, it is a function from a final outcome Z to a ten-digit line.

52
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
For example, if it is in Go, I look at the chess pieces I play.

53
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If someone's D is bigger, who wins?

54
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is how we describe the game.

55
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Then in this case, we have the same theoretical prediction.

56
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then our theoretical prediction here is actually using a concept.

57
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It is also balanced, but it is actually called perfectly balanced.

58
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Then in this case, it is everyone's strategy.

59
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It is actually in every situation where you can move.

60
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This means that it is from each H, and then it is the turn of the player I to do the action.

61
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Printed to say that you can do the action here.

62
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So a strategy is equal to telling me that every time it's my turn to move, what action do I want to do?

63
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When I know what everyone's strategy is, I say that a strategy set is perfectly balanced.

64
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It means that it is balanced in every history.

65
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In this case, this is a little bit more balanced than the previous mathematical concept.

66
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I know very well that the first few minutes are actually very boring.

67
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Because it is actually just defining math.

68
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But it may become more interesting later.

69
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because I started talking about some more real-world games.

70
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just want to stop here for a few seconds.

71
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to make sure that the audience has any questions.

72
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If there is no problem, then I will continue.

73
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What I just said is actually a 10-minute version of Crash Course.

74
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The next thing I want to talk about is Behavioral Game Theory.

75
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In other words, we think about whether this game predicts people's behavior well or not.

76
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Basically, we are thinking about whether it is balanced to predict people's behavior well.

77
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is the most important question in Behavioral Game Theory.

78
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
At this time, we can consider a game first.

79
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is called a mystery game.

80
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This game is actually a game proposed by Keynes in the 1930s.

81
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
At this time, you can imagine that there was a mystery game.

82
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Imagine that there are six bonus points left in the final of the mystery game.

83
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then they will publish the photos of the six bonus points on the newspaper.

84
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
At this time, in order to increase the exposure of everyone, the newspaper held a lottery.

85
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The lottery is to see the photos of the six bonus points.

86
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Please choose who will be the most popular person in this lottery.

87
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is the most popular person to vote for?

88
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
At this time, if you are participating in the lottery,

89
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
you are actually thinking about something in your head.

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not about which bonus point is the most handsome or beautiful.

91
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What you are thinking about is how others will think which one is the most handsome or beautiful.

92
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So this means that you are not thinking about what he absolutely thinks,

93
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but at the same time you are thinking about what others think.

94
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
At the same time, when you think so, others will also think that you will think so about me.

95
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Should I also think about it based on this matter?

96
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How should others think about me?

97
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So this is what Keynes described as the stock market.

98
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When everyone is buying and selling stocks,

99
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
they don't really care about how good this company is,

100
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
but what they care about is how others evaluate these companies.

101
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If I can make money, if others evaluate this company well,

102
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
should I consider doing business at this time?

103
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Something like this.

104
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Next, I'm going to talk about a game version.

105
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So the audience can play this game with me later.

106
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's imagine that there are 11 people in this chat room.

107
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So imagine that we play this game together.

108
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
N is equal to 11.

109
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The process of this game is that everyone chooses an integer from 0 to 100 at the same time.

110
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The winner of this game is the person who chooses the number closest to the average of two-thirds of all people.

111
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The person with the closest number is the winner of this game.

112
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Although I can't see everyone,

113
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
but if you are interested, you can take a pen and paper.

114
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll give you a few seconds to think about it.

115
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If we play this game together here,

116
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
what number would you like to choose?

117
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Anyway, let's think about it a little bit.

118
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then I'll talk about what the theoretical prediction will be.

119
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay, I think everyone should have thought about it.

120
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let me talk about it now.

121
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Anyway, let's think about it first.

122
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How do you think about this game?

123
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How many numbers did you choose?

124
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's take a look at what the theoretical prediction will predict.

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In this case,

126
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the theoretical prediction will make a very extreme prediction.

127
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It predicts that the balance of this game is that all players should choose 0.

128
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This will be a balance.

129
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Think about it.

130
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If I go to check, this thing is a balance.

131
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It means I'm going to check.

132
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Suppose I know that everyone else chooses 0,

133
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
what should I choose?

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Suppose I don't choose 0 today.

135
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If I change to a number x,

136
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In this case, the average of all types will be x divided by 11,

137
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and then multiplied by 2.

138
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The person who is closest to this number will win.

139
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Obviously, in this case,

140
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
0 will be closer to my target number than x.

141
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So it means that if I choose any number,

142
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it will only make me lose.

143
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So it means that I have to choose 0.

144
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If you go through some mathematical checks,

145
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you will find that this balance is actually the only balance in this game.

146
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So this is basically a very extreme theoretical prediction.

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's take a look at how everyone actually plays.

148
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is the first person to do this experiment in 1995.

149
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Then he found this.

150
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think it's quite a change.

151
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a picture of the whole behavior game theory.

152
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is the first experimental data just described.

153
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then you can see that this is the actual distribution of data.

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Then he found that in this case,

155
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
no one chose theoretical prediction.

156
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This means that the theoretical prediction of 0

157
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is not a very good model for explaining data.

158
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can also see that there are some particularly prominent points here.

159
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
For example, there are 33 and 22 here,

160
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
which are some particularly prominent numbers.

161
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This experimental data has been constantly replicated since 1995.

162
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It has been constantly replicated all over the world.

163
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is a very, very stable result.

164
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You can see that basically no one will choose 0 anywhere.

165
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then you can see that a lot of people choose 50, 33, 22, or 10.

166
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So he wanted to say that this balance

167
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
may not be a good description of the situation of such data.

168
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So because of this data,

169
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we inspired another model to take over to explain behavior.

170
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This model is called Level K.

171
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The Level K model actually assumes that everyone

172
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
can only think of a certain number,

173
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
just a few layers.

174
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This model assumes that everyone can think of different levels.

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The beginning of everything is the level 0 people.

176
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Level 0 people mean that

177
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
he was stupid when he saw this game.

178
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He didn't even know what number I should choose in this game.

179
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So this model assumes that

180
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
these people pick a random number from 0 to 100.

181
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Anyway, it's completely unstrategic.

182
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He just picked one at random.

183
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What about Level 1 people?

184
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He would like to say OK.

185
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He assumes that other people are all Level 0.

186
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So today he wants to respond in the most appropriate way.

187
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Other players are all Level 0 people.

188
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
At this time, he will calculate OK.

189
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
In this case,

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
if other people are all Level 0,

191
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
then my expected value is average.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The expected value of the number I chose for other people should be 50.

193
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So I want to choose 2 out of 50,

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
which is the number 33.

195
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Next,

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Level 2 people will assume that

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
other people are all Level 1.

198
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So other people will choose 33.

199
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then I have to choose 2 out of 33,

200
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
which is 22.

201
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So it goes on and on.

202
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Because of this,

203
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
the Level K model can basically explain

204
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
the information that appears here.

205
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here you can see that

206
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
a lot of people are at a lower density.

207
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They may be Level 0 Uniform.

208
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then you can see that

209
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
there is a peak here,

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
which means that

211
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
a lot of people may be Level 1.

212
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then there is a large density near 22.

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They may be people who want to be Level 2.

214
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So...

215
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Excuse me.

216
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But why...

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
For example, I am a Level N person.

218
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why do I have to assume that

219
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
everyone is exactly the same

220
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
as Level 1?

221
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can't I assume that there is no distribution?

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, that's a very good question.

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because this is another thing that

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we are going to deal with in this article.

225
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We will talk about it soon.

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But thank you.

227
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is just a simple introduction

228
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to the whole process of file development.

229
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is the first version of the model.

230
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But next,

231
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
with this model,

232
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
although it is mentioned by Yan Yong just now,

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this model actually

234
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
makes some very strong assumptions.

235
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
For example, people who choose N times

236
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
assume that everyone chooses N-1.

237
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But at least this model

238
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
can actually explain a lot of

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
strategic behavior in the case of Normal Form.

240
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But if you go back again,

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
imagine that at the beginning,

242
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
in the case of Eccentric Form,

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
there is no model

244
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that is similar to

245
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Hierarchical Thinking.

246
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Our goal in this paper

247
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is to propose

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
a concept of the same solution

249
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
on Eccentric Form,

250
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
which is also a model

251
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
of layered thinking.

252
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is probably my introduction.

253
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
In addition to Yan Yong's question,

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will answer it right away.

255
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Do other listeners have any questions?

256
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
If not,

257
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I will continue.

258
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Next, let's talk about

259
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
our model.

260
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's imagine

261
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
why the

262
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Level K model

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
is directly linked to

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
the Eccentric Form.

265
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At this time,

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the Level K model

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
defines the situation

268
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
where everyone makes a move at the same time.

269
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In other words, the original Level K model

270
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
does not consider

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the past behavior of others

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and should update my own

273
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
thoughts on others.

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It did not build it

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
into this model.

276
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That is to say,

277
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
when you face a situation

278
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
where you make a move at the same time,

279
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
this model can be used.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But when you face a situation

281
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
where others make a move in turn,

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the Level K model

283
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
predicts how smart

284
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
you should be.

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The next logical question

286
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is that we can look at

287
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
this simple example.

288
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let me use this tree

289
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to briefly explain and then

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
respond to some definitions of

291
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the Eccentric Form Game.

292
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Basically, we have a

293
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
H that defines all the chess pieces.

294
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
H here actually describes the

295
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
whole tree.

296
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Here, each top point

297
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
tells us where each decision

298
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
is made.

299
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The P function tells me

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
who is in charge of

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
each top point.

302
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's assume that

303
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Gao Xian and I are playing this game.

304
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Gao Xian is the second player,

305
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and I am the first player.

306
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Sorry, the host has been cued by me.

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But it doesn't matter.

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If Gao Xian is a person

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
who can think of four layers,

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
he will think that

311
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Bo Xian can think of three layers.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If Bo Xian can think of

313
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
one or two layers,

314
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
he will choose A

315
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
at the beginning.

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If Bo Xian can think of three layers,

317
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
he will choose B.

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If Bo Xian can think of

319
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
four layers,

320
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
he will think that

321
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Bo Xian must think of three layers.

322
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So in this situation,

323
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
he will definitely choose B.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Then I will definitely

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
go to the right branch.

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But if you find out

327
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that Bo Xian chose A,

328
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
then this situation

329
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
is a

330
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
incompatible situation

331
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
in terms of

332
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
how many layers

333
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you want to think of.

334
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This means that

335
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think Bo Xian wants to think of three layers,

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so I must be on the right side.

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But today it happened on the left side.

338
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is a problem that

339
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
may occur if you

340
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
look at it carefully.

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If you look at

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
this incompatibility,

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you will find that there are actually two problems.

344
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The first one is what Yan Yong just mentioned.

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
All players

346
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
assume that others are one level less than him.

347
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This means that

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Gao Xian thinks of four layers,

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
but he does not think of other possibilities.

350
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Bo Xian may not be so smart.

351
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He may not only think of three layers,

352
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
he may only think of two layers or one layer.

353
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So this is a problem with the original model.

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So he can't be directly

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
integrated into the game.

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Another problem is

357
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when you see the actions of others,

358
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
you should update

359
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
your evaluation of others.

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
For example, in this game,

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
if Gao Xian sees

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the left side,

363
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
then he should immediately notice

364
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that Bo Xian is definitely not thinking of three layers.

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But this behavior

366
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is not built

367
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
in the original static model.

368
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So these two things

369
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
are the two points

370
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that our model wants to break through.

371
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
At the same time, we have to deal with these two problems.

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Next,

373
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
let's talk about our model.

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
First of all,

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
this is a place that Yan Yong mentioned.

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
How do we deal with the first point?

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The first point is

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
the Cognitive Hierarchy Approach.

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
After these two words came out,

380
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
they finally put the whole

381
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
topic together.

382
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
This Cognitive Hierarchy Approach

383
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is a

384
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
advanced version of the Level K model.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It was introduced after 9 years

386
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
of Level K.

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The operation process of this model is as follows.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Every player

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
will have a level

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
at the beginning.

391
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Then everyone

392
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
draws this level independently

393
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
from the probability distribution.

394
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
At this time,

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Level K players no longer assume

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that everyone is just Level K-1.

397
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He assumes that everyone

398
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
may be Level 0, may be Level 1,

399
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
or may be from O to

400
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Level K-1.

401
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So these are all possible.

402
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Next,

403
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Level K players

404
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
may mistakenly think that everyone

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is from Level 0 to Level K-1.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
However,

407
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
their evaluation of others is not so wrong.

408
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That is,

409
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
their evaluation is at least

410
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
correct.

411
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
For those who are less than

412
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
my level,

413
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
their relative proportion

414
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
is correct.

415
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Next,

416
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
from a mathematical point of view,

417
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
we can use

418
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Mu ij to express this thing.

419
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Mu is

420
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
a probability density.

421
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is

422
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the evaluation of

423
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Player i and Player j.

424
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The K on the top

425
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
means that

426
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Level K player i's evaluation of Player j.

427
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
At this time,

428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
L is the probability

429
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
of Player j being L.

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If L is

431
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
greater than or equal to K,

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
it means that

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
others can think at least the same level as me

434
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
or be smarter than me.

435
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
In this model,

436
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
if you are a Level K player,

437
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
you will feel that

438
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
you are smarter than me.

439
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
At this time, I put 0 as the probability density.

440
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But if L is strictly

441
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
less than K,

442
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the probability density

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is the same as

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the real probability distribution.

445
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The only difference is that

446
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I have re-normalized it.

447
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It is re-normalized by

448
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Level 0 to Level K-1.

449
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
At this time,

450
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
these players are not so smart

451
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
in our model.

452
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It is possible that

453
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
everyone is smart.

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It assumes that

455
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
others think less than you,

456
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
but their ideas

457
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
are not so wrong.

458
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It is because

459
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
the overall distribution of others is correct.

460
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
At this time,

461
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
players have truncated rational expectations.

462
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You can observe

463
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that when we

464
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
do a direct exercise,

465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
when K is infinitely large,

466
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you can see that

467
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
in this expression,

468
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the ratio will be 1,

469
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
because the probability distribution

470
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
is 1.

471
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This means that

472
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
you can have

473
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
fully rational expectations.

474
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But if you

475
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
only think about K,

476
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you only have a partial

477
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
evaluation of other people's ideas.

478
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If you have

479
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
some questions

480
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
about K,

481
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
we can discuss later.

482
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But this article

483
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
is like this.

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It is an extension of Level K.

485
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We can

486
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
deal with the first problem,

487
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that is,

488
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
every player's

489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
idea of ​​Level is a fixed point.

490
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Next,

491
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
we will deal with how to update the message.

492
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
At this time,

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
we assume that

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
every history shot

495
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
will update its

496
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
after-effects probability,

497
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and then use Bayes' law

498
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to update the after-effects probability.

499
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This means that

500
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I can keep updating my

501
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
evaluation of others,

502
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and then I use

503
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
other people's past behavior

504
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to update my evaluation.

505
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When you make this assumption,

506
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you will immediately face

507
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
a problem,

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that is, if the

509
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
after-effects probability is

510
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
0,

511
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
then the after-effects probability

512
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
will not be well-defined.

513
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In fact,

514
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
there are many articles

515
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
dealing with

516
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
0 after-effects probability.

517
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
However,

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
there is no such problem

519
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
in this model.

520
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The reason is

521
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that no matter

522
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
what level you are,

523
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
you will have a certain chance

524
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
to think that the other person is

525
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
level 0.

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
When it comes to doing things,

527
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
people at level 0 will choose

528
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
at will.

529
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
In every

530
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
history, you will think

531
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that this thing is possible,

532
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
because at least there is a level 0,

533
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
he will choose there.

534
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That is to say,

535
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
my after-effects probability

536
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
is well-defined.

537
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
All players

538
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
simply respond

539
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to my belief

540
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
correctly.

541
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
If you can understand

542
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this part,

543
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
basically you have understood

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
our model.

545
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
To review a little more,

546
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
let's go back to the example

547
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
just now.

548
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
At this time,

549
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
let's take a look at what

550
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
our model is doing.

551
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We use this vector

552
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
to show

553
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
his evaluation of me.

554
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Because he thinks I may be level 0,

555
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
level 1, level 2, level 3.

556
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Four elements are enough

557
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
to express this probability density.

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So today,

559
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
when the model sees

560
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that I chose A at the beginning,

561
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
let's compare

562
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the three models

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
he gave us.

564
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He assumes

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that all players

566
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
can think of A as four elements,

567
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
but he thinks B must be three elements.

568
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So anyway,

569
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
he only puts the probability density at level 3.

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because of this,

571
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you can immediately see

572
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the incompatibility problem.

573
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Now let's take a look

574
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
at what he will give me

575
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
if we use the 2004 model.

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
At this time,

577
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we can see

578
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
that the 2004 model

579
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is also a static model.

580
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Therefore,

581
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
his evaluation of others will not be updated.

582
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He always thinks that others

583
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
work with truncated rational expectation.

584
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So his evaluation afterwards

585
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
is always assuming

586
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that others are level 0 to level 3.

587
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So his denominator is 0 plus 3.

588
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then his denominator

589
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
is just 0, 1, 2, 3.

590
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So this is just starting

591
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
from the real distribution.

592
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Assuming that others

593
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
only have the possibility of 0 to 3.

594
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Next,

595
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
let's talk about

596
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the possibility of his evaluation

597
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in our model.

598
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
First of all,

599
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
when the high-level player

600
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
sees that I chose A,

601
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
he will start to think

602
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
why I chose A.

603
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He will think

604
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that there are several possibilities.

605
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The first one is

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that Boxuan is actually a level 0

607
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and he is fooling around.

608
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So if he is level 0,

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I have half a chance to choose left

610
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and half a chance to choose right.

611
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So if I am level 0,

612
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I have half a chance to choose left.

613
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The other possibility is that

614
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Boxuan may be level 1 or level 2.

615
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So all the possibilities

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
appear on the left are put in the denominator,

617
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
which is one-half of P0 plus P1 plus P2.

618
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The above is

619
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
what Bayes' law tells us.

620
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We can observe the after-effects probability.

621
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We know that

622
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
under this sub-game,

623
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the high-level player can immediately

624
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
rule out the possibility that Boxuan is level 3.

625
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Because if he is level 3,

626
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I will definitely be in another sub-game.

627
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But now I'm here.

628
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This means that

629
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
when I calculate the after-effects probability,

630
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I will completely kill him.

631
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is basically the illustration

632
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
of Bayes' law.

633
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You can pause for a moment.

634
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If you have any questions,

635
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I just saw a question in the chat room.

636
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Let me take a look.

637
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh,

638
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
here is

639
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Thank you

640
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yi Ouyang.

641
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
He asked a question.

642
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What assumption did we make

643
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
on the probability density?

644
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
We actually assumed

645
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that each PK is greater than 0.

646
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This assumption is

647
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
without loss of generality.

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Thank you.

649
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But here we assume that

650
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
there is full support.

651
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
OK.

652
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then

653
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I will continue.

654
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Thank you very much for the question.

655
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Next,

656
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
this is a bit technical.

657
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But let me introduce a little bit.

658
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Under this model setting,

659
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
what general rules

660
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
do we have?

661
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
First of all,

662
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
under any extensible game,

663
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
let's say there are many people today.

664
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Let's say it's me and Gao Xian today.

665
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Then add a mysterious player X.

666
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Let's say there are three people playing.

667
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This theorem tells us that

668
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
if there are more than two people today,

669
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the after-effects probability

670
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
in each place

671
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
is actually a

672
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
joint probability

673
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
of each player.

674
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
This theorem tells us that

675
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
no matter where you are,

676
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the joint probability of your after-effects

677
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
will be

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
independent of each player.

679
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This also means that

680
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
what others did,

681
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
like what X did,

682
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
will not affect my evaluation of Gao Xian.

683
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
What Gao Xian did

684
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
will not affect my evaluation of X.

685
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Then the second theorem,

686
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
in fact, we can see

687
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that when this game

688
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
becomes longer and longer,

689
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I will have more evidence

690
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to know which level

691
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I am.

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So next,

693
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think the other person

694
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
has fewer and fewer

695
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
possibilities.

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This means that when the history

697
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
becomes longer,

698
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
my support will be smaller and smaller.

699
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The third one is

700
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that

701
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
we think that

702
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
there is a model solution

703
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
under this model.

704
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Because you can see that

705
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
when K becomes infinitely large,

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
people have fully rational expectations.

707
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
In this situation,

708
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
people will naturally ask

709
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
whether our model

710
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
will choose to be balanced

711
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
when K becomes infinitely large.

712
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The answer is not necessarily.

713
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
In other words,

714
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
if K does not choose to be balanced,

715
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
it has nothing to do with logic.

716
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
In other words,

717
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
we can find an example

718
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that K will choose to be balanced,

719
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and we can also find an example

720
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that K will never choose to be balanced.

721
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So this is a more general definition.

722
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is a more technical result.

723
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But I just listed it here.

724
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I won't say much.

725
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The above is actually

726
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
more like a pure mathematical model

727
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
in my eyes.

728
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
There are many different ideas

729
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
about science.

730
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But at least in my opinion,

731
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
if a model is a good model,

732
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it can be

733
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
detected

734
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or denied

735
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
by actual data.

736
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
In the current situation,

737
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
what we have found

738
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
is actually a mathematical solution,

739
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and it is a bit

740
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
too general.

741
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So we can't find

742
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
any more

743
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
falsifiable theoretical predictions.

744
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So next,

745
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
in order to get some predictions

746
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that we can test in practice,

747
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
let's consider

748
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the following very specific decision situation.

749
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
OK, let's consider

750
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the following game.

751
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
There are two people here.

752
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's change someone today.

753
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let's play with Yan Yong.

754
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
OK, let's play the game.

755
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Today's game is

756
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
take turns.

757
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
At the beginning,

758
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you can imagine it as an investment game.

759
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We are going to raise a...

760
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
For example,

761
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you can say watermelon, pumpkin,

762
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
or electronic chicken.

763
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But at the beginning, the size is one unit.

764
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Then every day,

765
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
we take turns to feed it,

766
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
water it, or invest.

767
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Every day,

768
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
everyone can do two actions.

769
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Either I decide to take,

770
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I want to take this chicken,

771
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
or I want to harvest this pumpkin.

772
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If I decide to harvest,

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the person who decides to harvest

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
can divide it into a larger part,

775
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and the person who is harvested

776
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
can take a smaller part.

777
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
At the same time,

778
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you have another option every day.

779
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I can invest C dollars

780
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
into this.

781
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
For example, you water this pumpkin

782
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and let it grow today.

783
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Or you decide to take this electronic chicken.

784
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Then this game is over.

785
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
According to the distribution we said,

786
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
divide this thing.

787
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But if you decide to invest,

788
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
this is actually a

789
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
strategic risk.

790
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's a strategic risk action.

791
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Because

792
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
if you choose to invest,

793
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
you have an advantage that

794
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
you can make this thing bigger.

795
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But your disadvantage is

796
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that the next day it's someone else's turn to decide.

797
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You have to decide to take

798
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
or continue to invest.

799
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So if you think

800
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
if someone else wants to invest,

801
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
you may think that I will invest today.

802
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But if you think you want to take today,

803
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
if you think you want to take tomorrow,

804
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you may think you want to take today.

805
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Because if someone else takes it,

806
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
someone else will get a bigger part tomorrow,

807
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and you will get a smaller part.

808
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So there is a trade-off here.

809
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But this is just a big concept of the game.

810
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
There will be a more detailed introduction later.

811
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This game is actually called

812
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
the centripetal game.

813
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Before I introduce the centripetal game,

814
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I will respond to

815
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yi Ouyang's question.

816
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yes, this is

817
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
common knowledge.

818
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Everyone knows the distribution of odds.

819
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you for your question.

820
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I will continue to talk about the centripetal game.

821
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Why is this thing called

822
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
centripetal game?

823
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
If you draw it as a tree map,

824
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
it looks like a centripetal game.

825
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's just because of this.

826
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The view of this tree map is like this.

827
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
At the beginning,

828
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Player 1 does things.

829
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If he decides to take it at the beginning,

830
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
he takes 1 and others take 0.

831
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But on the first day,

832
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
he can also decide to pass.

833
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If he passes,

834
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
this thing becomes C,

835
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
which increases the unit of C.

836
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So if it's Player 2's turn on the second day,

837
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Player 1 can only take C.

838
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Player 2 can take 1 plus C.

839
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Player 2 can decide to pass or take.

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If Player 2 decides to pass,

841
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
it's my turn on the third day.

842
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So you can imagine that

843
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
if I take this on the third day,

844
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
my odds become 1 plus 2C.

845
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Then others

846
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
can only take 2C.

847
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So in this case,

848
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
let's assume that

849
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we have a total of 2S days.

850
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So everyone can do S actions.

851
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is just a

852
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
technical assumption.

853
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Let's assume that

854
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
every increase of C

855
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
is between 1 to 1.

856
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This assumption

857
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is not a very strict assumption.

858
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We just make this thing

859
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
become an interesting question.

860
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You can imagine that

861
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
if C is too big,

862
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
everyone will keep passing.

863
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So it's not interesting.

864
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
If C is too small,

865
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
everyone will

866
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
just take it.

867
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's too trivial.

868
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So we consider

869
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a more interesting range.

870
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
In these assumptions,

871
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
we can see

872
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
how everyone

873
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
will play this game.

874
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Here is a balanced prediction.

875
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Everyone

876
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
has to take

877
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
as long as he can do actions.

878
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So we can go back and check

879
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the definition of balance.

880
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That is to say,

881
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
everyone has to do the best actions

882
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
in every history.

883
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So let's go back one by one.

884
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's look at the last day.

885
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's the second person's turn.

886
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He can decide

887
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
whether to take or pass.

888
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
If I take,

889
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I can take 1 plus 2S-1

890
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
times C.

891
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But if I decide to pass,

892
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I am 2SC.

893
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
In this case,

894
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
for the last day,

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
player 2 wants to

896
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
take.

897
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's more profitable to take.

898
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So if we go back

899
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to the last day,

900
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
if player 1 knows

901
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that player 2 will take the next day,

902
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
after the same calculation,

903
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
player 1 will think it's better to take.

904
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If it's player 2's turn

905
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
on the second day,

906
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
player 2 will also think it's better to take.

907
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
We can see that

908
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
the perfect balance

909
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
predicts an extreme result.

910
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
No matter how long the game is,

911
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
no matter how big C is,

912
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
between 1 to 1.3,

913
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
player 2 will always take.

914
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So no matter how long the game is,

915
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
it won't continue.

916
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Let's think about this.

917
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Excuse me.

918
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
My question is

919
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that you said

920
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
you wanted to do an experiment.

921
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
When you finished

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the theory part,

923
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I wanted to ask

924
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
if you wrote a Monte Carlo

925
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
to see how it would look like.

926
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
For example,

927
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
how many people play,

928
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
how many Cs,

929
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
what would the face space look like?

930
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Your question is really good.

931
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You are a worm in my stomach.

932
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This is something that will appear

933
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
after a few videos.

934
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Sorry.

935
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sorry, everyone.

936
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
My worm is talking again.

937
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm familiar with him,

938
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
so he knows what I'm going to say.

939
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So I just want to introduce

940
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the game environment.

941
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Next, let's see

942
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
why we choose Centipede Game.

943
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
First of all,

944
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
this...

945
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Sorry, I just laughed.

946
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The interesting thing about

947
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
the centipede game is

948
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
that it has been experimented for 30 years.

949
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Then we thought

950
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
we should find an environment

951
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
where the existing theory is not good,

952
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
so that there is room for new theory development.

953
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's take a look now.

954
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
For those who are

955
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
unfamiliar with this experiment,

956
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I would like to explain a little bit

957
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
what the data of this experiment will look like.

958
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Let's say we are now

959
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
not good at math. Let's say we only have 10 people.

960
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If there are 10 people,

961
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
let's do the experiment.

962
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The experimenter will randomly

963
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
pair two people and pair two people.

964
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So there are five teams here.

965
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So after each team starts playing this game,

966
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
my observation

967
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
is that a team of players will have an observation value,

968
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
which is the day

969
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
they decided

970
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
to take it.

971
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So this is the observation value,

972
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
which is my terminal period.

973
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Our balanced prediction

974
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
is a degenerate distribution,

975
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
that is, all the probability densities

976
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
will be placed on the first day.

977
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But in fact,

978
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
in 1992,

979
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
this was the first experiment

980
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
my boss did,

981
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
he found that only 1% of people

982
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
would choose to be balanced.

983
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
This means that balancing in this situation

984
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
is not a good prediction.

985
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
In fact, it should be a pretty bad prediction.

986
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The first reason is

987
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
that the actual behavior

988
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
is very, very far

989
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
from the existing balanced theory.

990
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So people may think that

991
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
our theory has room to play.

992
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
At the same time,

993
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
we are dealing with this environment.

994
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
In fact, there is a purpose that is one more than two times.

995
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Because in the past 30 years,

996
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
this is a no-fail game.

997
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
In fact, it has been repeated

998
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
many times.

999
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But there are two possible

1000
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
methods in the experiment.

1001
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
One is to use the extensive form,

1002
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
that is, I ask everyone once

1003
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
whether you want to take it or pass it today.

1004
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The other is to ask other people

1005
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
if you know that other people want to pass it,

1006
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
do you want to take it or pass it?

1007
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So this is what I ask one after another.

1008
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But the same experiment,

1009
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
you can also ask another question.

1010
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
My other approach is

1011
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I directly ask

1012
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
how many days do you want to take

1013
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and I ask another person

1014
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
how many days do you want to take.

1015
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So these two things,

1016
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
many people are arguing

1017
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
whether these two questions

1018
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
are still under debate.

1019
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So because of this,

1020
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
we are going to talk about

1021
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
theoretical prediction.

1022
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It is not only testable,

1023
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
but we also want to solve

1024
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
a big debate

1025
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
in the method theory of

1026
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
experimental economics.

1027
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This is why we choose martial arts.

1028
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Next, before I start talking about

1029
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
my theoretical prediction,

1030
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I will briefly explain

1031
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
what these two methods look like.

1032
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
This example is a six-legged centipede.

1033
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
There are two people,

1034
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
so there are six stages here.

1035
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So in Extensive Form,

1036
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
you can look at the above picture.

1037
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I just simply ask the first person

1038
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
if you want to take it or pass it,

1039
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and then I ask the second person

1040
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
if you want to take it or pass it.

1041
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
At the same time,

1042
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I can also ask him

1043
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
how many decisions

1044
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
do you want to make

1045
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
when you decide to take it.

1046
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Take the first time means

1047
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I want to take it on the first day.

1048
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Take the second time means

1049
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I want to pass it on the first day,

1050
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and I want to take it on the second day.

1051
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The second option is

1052
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I want to take it on the third day.

1053
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
The third option means

1054
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I want to take it on the fifth day

1055
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
or I want to pass it on forever.

1056
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So for both players,

1057
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
they have four choices.

1058
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So these two methods

1059
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
have balanced predictions.

1060
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Theoretically,

1061
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
no matter what form you use

1062
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
to play this game,

1063
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
you have to take it on the first day.

1064
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So under these two methods,

1065
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
theoretical prediction

1066
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is the same as

1067
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Degenerate Distribution.

1068
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
All probability densities are placed on the first day.

1069
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But our model predicts

1070
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
that the results of these two methods

1071
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
will be different.

1072
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
The following is

1073
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
our article

1074
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
on the most difficult to prove theorem.

1075
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The following is the theorem.

1076
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
For any centripetal game,

1077
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you can see that

1078
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
in our current centripetal game,

1079
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
there are two parameters that can determine

1080
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the centripetal game.

1081
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The first is c,

1082
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
which is how much weight

1083
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
this centripetal can increase

1084
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
every time.

1085
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The second is s,

1086
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
which is how many feet this centripetal has.

1087
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The theorem is for any c and s.

1088
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It is a theorem for any

1089
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
prior to the level.

1090
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it is a theorem for any

1091
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
prior to the level.

1092
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Now, let's say I do an experiment today.

1093
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I randomized

1094
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
my method of doing the experiment.

1095
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I randomized that some people

1096
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I use NormalFoam to play.

1097
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Some people use ExtensiveFoam.

1098
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
The result I get is

1099
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
that under NormalFoam,

1100
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I can find a probability density function

1101
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or calculate the cumulative probability density function.

1102
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Then I can also find out the cumulative probability density function

1103
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
under ExtensiveFoam.

1104
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Then the next theoretical prediction is

1105
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
that the cumulative probability density function

1106
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
under NormalFoam

1107
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
will be First-Order Stochastically Dominate.

1108
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
will be First-Order Stochastically Dominate.

1109
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This is the cumulative probability density

1110
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
under ExtensiveFoam.

1111
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This is the cumulative probability density

1112
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
under ExtensiveFoam.

1113
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This theorem can be introduced first.

1114
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What is FOSD?

1115
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I thought about it before the speech.

1116
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It seems to be showing me a good example.

1117
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
If you don't like it,

1118
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you can leave a message again.

1119
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Everyone says that

1120
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
In the exam.

1121
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The scans of this year are harder.

1122
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Or simpler than last year.

1123
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You can also make a comparison.

1124
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What is the difference?

1125
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The first order esperiential

1126
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
is faster this year.

1127
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
First Order Stochastically Dominate

1128
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I believe this theorem shows

1129
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm looking at the top, front,

1130
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
middle, back, bottom.

1131
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
If my top score is 70 last year,

1132
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I will be 80 this year.

1133
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If my front score is 65 last year,

1134
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I will be 70 this year.

1135
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So it's more than every score.

1136
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
In fact, it is the corresponding score

1137
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
for each PR value.

1138
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
If this year's score is higher than last year's,

1139
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
then this year's score is relatively simple.

1140
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
In the sense of FOSD.

1141
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So if you change it to

1142
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
cumulative probability density,

1143
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it will look like this.

1144
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
If the red line is FOSD,

1145
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
the blue line means that

1146
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
the red line will always be pressed

1147
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
under the blue line.

1148
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Or the red line will be

1149
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
on the right side of the blue line.

1150
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The next question is

1151
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
what our theoretical prediction

1152
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
will look like in this situation.

1153
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Here is a simple example.

1154
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
If you have four corners,

1155
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
your possible terminal node

1156
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
is the first, second,

1157
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
third, fourth day,

1158
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
or the last day,

1159
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
so it's the fifth day.

1160
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So there are five possibilities.

1161
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The blue one is

1162
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
the result of our dynamic CH prediction.

1163
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The red line is

1164
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
the result of our

1165
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
theoretical prediction.

1166
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The red line is

1167
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the result of our

1168
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
theoretical prediction.

1169
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
The red line is

1170
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
the result of our

1171
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
theoretical prediction.

1172
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
No matter where you play,

1173
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
no matter what your C and S look like,

1174
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
you will always see this relationship.

1175
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The blue line is on the red line.

1176
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So today,

1177
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
no matter what your

1178
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Distribution of Levels looks like,

1179
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
what you move is just the absolute position

1180
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
of the blue line and the red line.

1181
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But relatively speaking,

1182
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
the blue line will always be

1183
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
on the red line.

1184
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So this is our theoretical prediction.

1185
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Let's say that

1186
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
each player is playing with

1187
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Extensive Form Game,

1188
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
it will be more balanced.

1189
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
In a sense,

1190
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
they will decide to take earlier.

1191
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So here I want to

1192
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
talk a little bit about

1193
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
why this thing is

1194
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
testable.

1195
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because when I'm doing an experiment today,

1196
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm in the same group of collectors,

1197
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm going to randomize,

1198
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
some people can play with Normal Form,

1199
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
this blue line

1200
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and the red line

1201
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
are directly what we theoretically

1202
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
see in the data.

1203
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So when we see this next,

1204
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
we have a lot of

1205
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
statistical tools to say

1206
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
whether the blue line is

1207
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
significantly different from the red line.

1208
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And we can see that

1209
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the two of them are FOSD different.

1210
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So this is why

1211
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
our experiment results are testable.

1212
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then the second thing is

1213
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
why this theoretical prediction

1214
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
is very good for experimentalists.

1215
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It is also a stress test for us.

1216
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Because

1217
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
this theory, although it has a lot of parameters

1218
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
in it at the beginning,

1219
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but in the end our statement is parameter-free,

1220
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that is, it is not related to any function,

1221
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
not related to any parameter.

1222
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So the only requirement is

1223
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
that I do randomization

1224
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
in the same group of collectors.

1225
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This means that as an experimenter,

1226
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
you can pick a C and S at will.

1227
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So at this time you can say

1228
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that I want 10 legs for my martial arts,

1229
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I want 20 legs,

1230
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and I want to pick 0.5 for my C,

1231
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
so I can pick 0.7 and 0.8 at a time.

1232
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
In these cases,

1233
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the only change is

1234
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the shape of blue and red,

1235
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
but the relative position is still

1236
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
always here,

1237
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
the blue line is always on the red line.

1238
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So it means that for the experimenter,

1239
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
he has a lot of freedom.

1240
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And again, because it is

1241
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
all right,

1242
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
it means that I do this experiment

1243
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
in Taiwan, or in Europe,

1244
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
or in the United States,

1245
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
he has to see this.

1246
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So it means that our theory provides

1247
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
a very strong theoretical prediction.

1248
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Although it is very, very,

1249
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
that is to say,

1250
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
if you do it wrong in any way,

1251
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
there is no way to present our results,

1252
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
it may deny our theory.

1253
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But in other words,

1254
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
if I do this experiment,

1255
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
it means that our theory

1256
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
is a very, very big support.

1257
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So this is

1258
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
this is

1259
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
we have different statements in paper,

1260
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
but this is a more generalized

1261
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
version of a statement.

1262
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Then,

1263
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
because I think the time is almost up,

1264
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
so I might just summarize it a little bit.

1265
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Then we will leave some time for Q&A.

1266
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
If you have any questions,

1267
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
we can meet again,

1268
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
we can talk a little bit after five minutes.

1269
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In conclusion,

1270
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
what did we do with this model?

1271
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
The most important message is that

1272
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
when you see the behavior of others in the past,

1273
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
it actually tells you

1274
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
where the progress of the game is now.

1275
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It also tells you

1276
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
how many layers it can think of.

1277
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
This message is actually hidden

1278
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
in other people's past behavior.

1279
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Then if we say

1280
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
we apply any static model directly,

1281
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
whether it is level K or CH model,

1282
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
it will actually find that

1283
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
our ideas and the behavior we see

1284
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
may be inconsistent.

1285
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So at this time,

1286
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
we use the new model we provide

1287
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
to solve this incompatibility problem.

1288
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
For those

1289
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
who do CS computing here,

1290
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
we can think about

1291
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the question that may come to mind

1292
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is whether this thing is easy to solve.

1293
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
In fact, my response is

1294
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
that our model is

1295
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
a very easy thing for the computer.

1296
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
The reason is

1297
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
that its code can actually

1298
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
be rewritten with a for loop.

1299
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That is to say,

1300
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
people at each level

1301
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
actually use the same method to do things.

1302
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
When I solve this model,

1303
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I first think about people at level 1.

1304
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Suppose everyone is level 0.

1305
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Then I will solve what is the best thing to do at level 1.

1306
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Then people at level 2

1307
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
will look at what level 0 and level 1 are doing.

1308
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Then I will explain what these people are doing.

1309
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Then I update my belief.

1310
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Then I choose what is the best behavior

1311
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Next, people at level 3

1312
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
assume that others are level 1, level 0, level 1, level 2.

1313
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Then do the same thing.

1314
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So it is actually a recursive definition method.

1315
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It is very easy to solve in math.

1316
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It is very easy to calculate on the computer.

1317
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
But relative to the balanced model,

1318
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
it is actually solving a fixed point problem.

1319
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Because everyone must

1320
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
respond to each other at the same time.

1321
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So at this time,

1322
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
it's like you're solving several equations.

1323
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So at this time,

1324
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
you may not have chosen the right conditions at the beginning.

1325
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
But in our model,

1326
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
it is the only one.

1327
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And it exists.

1328
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And it is very easy to solve.

1329
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So these are some good properties.

1330
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The other part of the article

1331
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
is a very strong

1332
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
theory prediction

1333
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
that can be denied in practice.

1334
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that can be denied in practice.

1335
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That is to say,

1336
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
we assume that in a group of the same number,

1337
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
you use the extension function to play

1338
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
or the normal function to play

1339
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
, we will find that

1340
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
all the players

1341
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
should take it earlier

1342
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
in the sense of FOSD.

1343
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
In the sense of FOSD.

1344
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
This is true for any sense of beginning.

1345
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And it is true in any place.

1346
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So this is a very strong assumption.

1347
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So when this assumption

1348
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
can be proven,

1349
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
it means that

1350
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
it is a great support for our theory.

1351
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
At the end,

1352
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
some future prospects

1353
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
can be extended.

1354
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
The first one is the experiment.

1355
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Now I am thinking with my teacher

1356
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and Wang Daoyi from NTU.

1357
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
How do we set up an experiment

1358
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
to verify our strong prediction?

1359
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The next theory is

1360
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
at least the second point.

1361
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The theory is the second episode

1362
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I am writing now.

1363
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's about the same model.

1364
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
In the second article,

1365
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I can briefly talk about it,

1366
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
but I can't talk much because I don't have much time.

1367
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The first thing to think about

1368
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
is that

1369
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
in this game,

1370
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
you will have

1371
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
incomplete information.

1372
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's like playing Dezopuk.

1373
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
All the information

1374
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
is the two hand cards

1375
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
on your hand

1376
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and the card on the table.

1377
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But you don't know

1378
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
what the player's hand card is.

1379
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So in general,

1380
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
we can only predict

1381
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
what the player's hand card

1382
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
will look like

1383
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
when he or she decides to play.

1384
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But

1385
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
in our theory today,

1386
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
when someone else is going to play

1387
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
or decide to fold,

1388
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
can you update

1389
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
if the other player is a good match?

1390
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
If the other player

1391
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
just randomly plays,

1392
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
you may know that

1393
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
you don't have to care about his hand card.

1394
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
This should be a level 0.

1395
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This theory already has

1396
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
a building in it, but it's not very tractable.

1397
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So now I'm writing

1398
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
a new theory

1399
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
to discuss this matter.

1400
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
In two months,

1401
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm going to use this

1402
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
second bullet point to test my candidates.

1403
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Then there are other applications.

1404
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Our theory

1405
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
is a very general setting.

1406
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It can be applied to a lot of places.

1407
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
For example, social learning.

1408
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
This may be something like

1409
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
you've never been to a restaurant

1410
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
and you're not sure

1411
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
if the restaurant is good or bad.

1412
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
All you see is

1413
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
a group of people queuing up.

1414
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
At this time,

1415
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
the general theory may be

1416
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
that I only use the behavior of others

1417
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
to update whether this restaurant is good or not.

1418
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But it's very likely

1419
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
that if you see this restaurant

1420
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
queueing up every time,

1421
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
but you go to see the medicine,

1422
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
many people say it's not ideal.

1423
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
At this time,

1424
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
you have to update your belief

1425
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
that those people in line

1426
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
may be level 0 people.

1427
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
This means that their behavior

1428
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
is not too much

1429
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
in line.

1430
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It's not really

1431
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
how delicious this thing is.

1432
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
If our model is applied

1433
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
to social learning,

1434
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
a similar situation may occur.

1435
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Then you can also apply it to

1436
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
political science, such as voting.

1437
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
For example, if you vote for a candidate,

1438
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
it's like playing a game with a voter.

1439
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
The candidate keeps raising his ID,

1440
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and the voter decides

1441
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
whether to vote for him or another person.

1442
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So it's very likely that

1443
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
after he raises his ID,

1444
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
you update that this candidate

1445
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
may be a level 0 candidate.

1446
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then there may be

1447
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the case of negotiation.

1448
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In any game where you have to take turns

1449
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
to make a move,

1450
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
our theory actually applies.

1451
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000

This article is actually finished.

1456
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It's already pre-printed.

1457
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000

I will also share this video with you.

1460
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I will also put it on the website,

1461
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
so you can go and see it.

1462
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Next, because this speech

1463
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
is recorded,

1464
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you can also find it on Project Tyra.

1465
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Thank you very much.

1466
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Okay.

1467
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Now it should be better.

1468
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Okay.

1469
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'll say it again.

1470
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Thank you very much

1471
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
for Boxuan's speech,

1472
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
especially for your detailed explanation

1473
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
to help me understand

1474
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
your theoretical model.

1475
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I think because we just

1476
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
opened some Q&A answers

1477
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
in the process,

1478
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
because it's still being recorded,

1479
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
we can open a few more questions.

1480
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I think the Q&A time

1481
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
is divided into two parts.

1482
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The first part is to keep recording.

1483
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The second part, I will turn off the recording

1484
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and we will save time.

1485
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So now in the process of recording,

1486
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I don't know if there are any questions

1487
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that the audience wants to ask.

1488
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
You can look at the microphone yourself.

1489
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Someone just asked

1490
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
in the message area,

1491
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
did you say In-N-Out hamburger?

1492
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I said yes.

1493
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
My answer is yes.

1494
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I also want to ask a question.

1495
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I want to brush up on my sense of presence.

1496
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I actually think

1497
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
because you mentioned a lot of

1498
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
detailed explanations,

1499
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
so it really helped me.

1500
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I actually have a question.

1501
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You just mentioned the number guessing game.

1502
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
In fact, in the number guessing game,

1503
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I feel that its essence

1504
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
is a bit like

1505
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
there is no competition between players.

1506
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
In the later martial arts game,

1507
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
what I mean by no competition

1508
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
is that I just have to

1509
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
work hard to guess the correct number.

1510
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
In fact, in the later martial arts game,

1511
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
there is competition.

1512
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And I have to guess

1513
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that you don't want to

1514
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
win in this round,

1515
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
but you are still

1516
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
greedy enough.

1517
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So I think there seems to be

1518
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
some fundamental differences

1519
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
between these two games.

1520
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So I'm not sure

1521
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
if this is a question

1522
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
of clarification.

1523
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But in fact,

1524
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
thank you very much for your question.

1525
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
There are some differences

1526
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
between these two games.

1527
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
First of all,

1528
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
because it is a no-attack round 6 move,

1529
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and then it is a number guessing game,

1530
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
it is a move at the same time.

1531
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Secondly,

1532
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
in fact,

1533
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
because when you are

1534
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
a move at the same time,

1535
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
how do you say

1536
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
In the end, the winner is

1537
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
the one who is closest to the winner.

1538
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So in a way,

1539
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the one who is closest to the winner wins.

1540
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But his problem is that

1541
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
his payoff does not grow

1542
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
because of what you do.

1543
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
If you win, you win. If you lose, you lose.

1544
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But in the martial arts game,

1545
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
if you two go together,

1546
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
you two decide to

1547
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
say that we go together for 10 days

1548
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and then start playing this game,

1549
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
it is true that in a way,

1550
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
he will cheat and say that

1551
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I decided to take the lead first.

1552
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So it is true that

1553
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
his thinking may be different

1554
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
in two games.

1555
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But thank you very much for your question.

1556
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yes, because it feels like the previous

1557
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
number guessing game

1558
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
because its answer is fixed.

1559
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The martial arts game

1560
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
is not fixed.

1561
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It follows another person at any time.

1562
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So I don't know if these two differences

1563
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
will affect your model settings.

1564
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
In fact, it is not very likely

1565
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
because our model is set in a very general situation.

1566
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Speaking of this solution,

1567
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
if you are interested,

1568
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
you can type in the comment area

1569
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and swipe a row.

1570
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It doesn't matter if you are shy.

1571
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
We can also talk about

1572
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
what number you chose after the recording.

1573
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I am quite curious.

1574
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yes, but you can see that

1575
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it is 25.

1576
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Good.

1577
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's pretty good.

1578
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Then you can choose the number 20.

1579
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
50.

1580
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
OK.

1581
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Anyway, everyone can choose.

1582
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If you are shy, you can talk about it later.

1583
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I have a question.

1584
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
First of all, Xu Youzhen chose 25.

1585
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's not me.

1586
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
The problem is that

1587
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
you make an assumption.

1588
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
This assumption is that

1589
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
those who participate in this game

1590
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
will make the most rational

1591
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and best choice.

1592
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The real limitation is that

1593
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
he is not smart enough.

1594
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Or we say that his thinking depth is limited.

1595
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But like Gao Xian said,

1596
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
how do you know that

1597
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
when you really want to implement

1598
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
this experiment to a group of people,

1599
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
there will be no bad guys.

1600
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Or he deliberately

1601
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
does not follow the rules.

1602
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Or he had an accident at home yesterday,

1603
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
so his choice of behavior is very strange.

1604
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Something like that.

1605
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Will this thing be an interesting probe?

1606
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Can you take the experiment

1607
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
you want to implement

1608
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
to reverse it?

1609
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
If I measured it today,

1610
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I can prove that

1611
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
this group of people may have

1612
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
had an accident at home.

1613
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Thank you very much for your question.

1614
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It sounds a bit noisy,

1615
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
but it's actually a very serious question.

1616
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The first is that

1617
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
our theory

1618
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
does not say

1619
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that he may be a

1620
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
setting defect

1621
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
or a model feature.

1622
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Our only limitation is that

1623
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
he can't choose

1624
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
the degree of that place.

1625
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's not because he made a mistake,

1626
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
but because his brain can't think so much.

1627
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
In other cases,

1628
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
some people deliberately

1629
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
continue to pass on in martial arts.

1630
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It is very likely that

1631
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
he is a level 0 person in our model.

1632
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But of course,

1633
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
there is another type of people

1634
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
who like to pass on.

1635
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So his decision-making behavior

1636
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
is to pass on wherever he meets.

1637
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Our model is actually

1638
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
more like a method theory.

1639
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Of course, it can be extended

1640
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
to say that I can add

1641
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
other crazy types of people

1642
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
into it.

1643
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Our model is also used

1644
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
to simply rewrite

1645
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
how many types there are.

1646
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Our model is more like

1647
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
what mistakes they made.

1648
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
In fact, I can talk about

1649
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
the fact that

1650
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
some people are thinking about this in

1651
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
experimental economics.

1652
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
For example,

1653
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
we have a game

1654
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
called the dictator game.

1655
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Let's say I play a game with you today.

1656
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I have 100 yuan to share.

1657
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I decide how much I want to share with you.

1658
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You have nothing to say.

1659
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'll give you as much money as you want.

1660
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
We can use this to

1661
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
measure other people's preferences.

1662
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
For example,

1663
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
how much other people's preferences

1664
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
are fair to society.

1665
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We can use

1666
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
other environments

1667
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
to measure

1668
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
how much

1669
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
other people's preferences

1670
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
are fair to society.

1671
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Or

1672
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
there is another game

1673
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
called the final match.

1674
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
This game is very similar.

1675
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The first person decides

1676
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
how much money I want to give you.

1677
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
The second person decides

1678
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
whether to accept this offer or not.

1679
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
If he doesn't want it,

1680
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
everyone won't take it.

1681
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
If he accepts it,

1682
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
he will use this method.

1683
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
We can also use

1684
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
how much money he will give to others

1685
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and whether others will accept it

1686
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to see what he thinks of others.

1687
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
In fact,

1688
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
at least in the final match,

1689
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
there are other games

1690
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
that try to detect

1691
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
other people's preferences

1692
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
in addition to strategic thinking.

1693
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
That's all for now.

1694
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Thank you for your questions.

1695
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Do you have any other questions?

1696
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Or we can

1697
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
stop recording and chat later.

1698
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Does anyone

1699
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
have any questions

1700
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
before the recording ends?

1701
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Can I ask a question?

1702
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Sure.

1703
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Hello, I am

1704
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Huang Feiyang from Jianqiao University.

1705
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I am a neurosurgeon.

1706
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I have two questions.

1707
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
The first one

1708
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
is more like your extension.

1709
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Because it seems that

1710
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
your model depends on

1711
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
assuming that

1712
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
this person knows

1713
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
his level very clearly.

1714
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Is there a possibility that

1715
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
he is not sure of his level

1716
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
in terms of distribution?

1717
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It sounds like this.

1718
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Because I feel that

1719
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
in fact, the detector

1720
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
may not be sure where he is.

1721
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
This is the first question.

1722
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
The second question is more technical.

1723
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
In fact,

1724
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
your prediction is that

1725
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
extensive games

1726
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
will be found earlier

1727
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
than normal game.

1728
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I want to ask

1729
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
how do you prove FOSD in practice?

1730
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Because even if you are poor,

1731
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
you can only guess

1732
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
that he may be close to FOSD.

1733
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Because if you can't find the antithesis,

1734
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
it doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

1735
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So how much in practice

1736
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
will let you

1737
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
be sure that

1738
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
your inference is correct?

1739
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Both questions

1740
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
are very good.

1741
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Thank you very much for your question.

1742
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Let's do it one by one.

1743
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
First,

1744
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
the technical point is that

1745
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I totally agree with you.

1746
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
After all,

1747
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
this is the first

1748
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
method in Extensible.

1749
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So I think

1750
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
this is totally feasible.

1751
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
In fact,

1752
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
what I know is that

1753
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
some people's methods

1754
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
in normal game

1755
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
are more like this.

1756
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Although everyone

1757
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
has a different level.

1758
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It may be different

1759
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
in every game.

1760
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But everyone has a capacity.

1761
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
No matter how smart I am,

1762
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I still play to a certain extent.

1763
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
But based on different games

1764
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and different people

1765
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and different opponents,

1766
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I have different beliefs.

1767
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
In this case,

1768
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
the level I may show is different.

1769
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
This is another kind of extension.

1770
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But as you just mentioned,

1771
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I'm not sure

1772
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
what my level is today.

1773
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
In the process of playing the game,

1774
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
you will learn several things at the same time.

1775
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
First, you will learn

1776
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
how smart you are.

1777
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Second, how smart others are.

1778
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Third, if there is incomplete information,

1779
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
what does the incomplete information

1780
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
of others look like?

1781
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
If so,

1782
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
you may learn a lot

1783
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
under your model setting.

1784
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
But I think it's totally feasible.

1785
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Thank you for your first question.

1786
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Next, let's talk about the second question.

1787
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The second question is about the experiment.

1788
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I think what you said

1789
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
is right.

1790
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
We can only say that

1791
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
given the FOSD relationship,

1792
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
we can only say that

1793
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
we can only say that

1794
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
given the FOSD relationship,

1795
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
we can only say that

1796
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
we can only say that

1797
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
we can only say that

1798
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
we can only say that

1799
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
although FOSD is possible.

1800
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
although FOSD is possible.

1801
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
how to say

1802
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
any arena

1803
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
any arena

1804
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The makeup of our team

1805
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the makeup of our team

1806
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But the meme

1807
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
But the meme

1808
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
A rough case

1809
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
A rough case

1810
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
A rough case

1811
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
a rough case

1812
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
A rough case

1813
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
We try our best to pick some extreme cases

1814
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
We try our best to pick some extreme cases

1815
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
If in these cases

1816
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
It all shows

1817
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
At least we see that in fact

1818
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Because the blue line and the red line are two CDFs

1819
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
This is a result that can be directly observed in practice

1820
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So if we say

1821
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
In all kinds of extreme situations

1822
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
In all kinds of extreme situations

1823
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
In all kinds of extreme situations

1824
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We all see the blue line and the red line

1825
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
If there is such a relationship

1826
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Then maybe we can only say

1827
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We only meet a necessary condition

1828
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But this does not mean that it is a sufficient condition

1829
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I think what you said is something like this

1830
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's true that we're just

1831
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
If we pick a C or S

1832
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
If we pick a C or S

1833
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's just to verify that the necessary conditions are met

1834
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
The sufficient conditions may not be right

1835
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
But what we can do

1836
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But what we can do

1837
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The best thing we can do in practice is

1838
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It's like trying to deny our model

1839
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It's like trying to deny our model

1840
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
If we say that we have no way to deny it

1841
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Maybe it can be said that our model is right

1842
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
But how right is it

1843
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It does take more and more

1844
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
How do you explain

1845
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because after all, in many cases

1846
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
When you verify the model

1847
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
You are just verifying the prediction that it can be tested

1848
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So in this case

1849
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You are based on the model

1850
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Some of the results found

1851
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Let me see if it will meet this thing

1852
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It's like verifying its necessary conditions

1853
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
If this thing is wrong, the model will be counterproductive

1854
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But I think the questions you ask are very good

1855
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I'm not sure if my answer is good

1856
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I'm very sorry

1857
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Thank you very much for your question

1858
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I don't know if I can answer you

1859
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Yes, thank you

1860
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Thank you very much

1861
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
If the answer is not good, you can talk to me later

1862
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Thank you, thank you for your question

1863
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Thank you Boxuan

1864
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'll turn off the recording right away

1865
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Before turning off the recording

1866
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Do you want to do the last clarification

1867
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
For

1868
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Maybe there will be potential viewers in the future

1869
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Will watch your video

1870
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So do you want to do the final interpretation

1871
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Or concluding remark

1872
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I think it seems

1873
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

1874
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
But I think I seem to have talked about it

1875
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Because mainly

1876
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I think I have talked about it

1877
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yes yes yes

1878
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But thank you

1879
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
If there are future viewers who want to watch

1880
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Thank you very much

1881
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Thank you very much for watching

1882
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
No no no

1883
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Thank you Boxuan, I'll turn off the recording now
