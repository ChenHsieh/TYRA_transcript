00:00.000 --> 00:12.540
Thank you everyone for coming to the speech on January 22, 2022.

00:12.540 --> 00:16.140
Today's speaker is Dr. Zheng Huaijie.

00:16.140 --> 00:25.800
He obtained a master's degree and master's degree from Taiwan University between 2010 and 2013,

00:25.800 --> 00:29.440
and then stayed for a while at NTU Haiyan.

00:29.640 --> 00:38.440
Later, in 2015, he was a Ph.D. student at Cornell University's Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science.

00:38.440 --> 00:50.440
Last year, he obtained a Ph.D. degree and joined the research team of Fernando Perez from the University of California, Buckeye, California.

00:50.440 --> 00:56.940
He is now implementing a plan, which is the topic he is going to talk about today, the Joe Piter Meets the Earth plan.

00:56.940 --> 01:06.940
He will talk about how to use these softwares in atmospheric and geoscientific applications.

01:06.940 --> 01:11.940
Let's welcome Dr. Zheng Huaijie to give a speech.

01:11.940 --> 01:16.940
Everyone can turn on the microphone to encourage our speaker.

01:16.940 --> 01:26.940
Thank you for your introduction.

01:26.940 --> 01:29.940
Let me share my screen.

01:29.940 --> 01:35.940
Can you see it?

01:35.940 --> 01:44.940
Thank you again for your introduction.

01:44.940 --> 01:50.940
Thank you for coming to listen to my speech.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.940
My name is Zheng Huaijie.

01:52.940 --> 02:03.940
The topic I want to talk about today is the Joe Piter Meets the Earth plan I am implementing as a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.

02:03.940 --> 02:10.940
I have posted a link to the video in the chat room.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.940
If you are interested, you can read it yourself.

02:13.940 --> 02:16.940
But what you see should be the same.

02:16.940 --> 02:22.940
The main goal of this plan is to build the first software ecosystem.

02:22.940 --> 02:27.940
If you hear anything you don't understand, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.940
Because there may be some Korean words.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.940
I'm not sure if you can understand.

02:33.940 --> 02:36.940
So please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

02:36.940 --> 02:42.940
Why can't I use it?

02:42.940 --> 02:49.940
Today, in the next hour or so, I will divide the content into five parts.

02:49.940 --> 02:55.940
First, I will add some things, including what I am doing now and what I was doing before.

02:55.940 --> 02:59.940
How did these things lead me to this plan?

02:59.940 --> 03:05.940
Before I talk about Joe Piter Meets the Earth, I will talk about what Joe Piter is.

03:05.940 --> 03:09.940
What kind of challenges does earth science currently face?

03:09.940 --> 03:14.940
Finally, we will discuss what the goal of Joe Piter Meets the Earth is and what we have accomplished so far.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.940
The last part is our future prospects and plans.

03:19.940 --> 03:25.940
And we see some efforts being made in the geoscience community.

03:25.940 --> 03:36.940
My own field of research is geoscience, geophysics, earth physics, and geospatial deformation.

03:37.940 --> 03:40.940
Here is a demo.

03:40.940 --> 03:45.940
I will tell you what my research plan is doing.

03:45.940 --> 03:48.940
You can imagine that there is an iceberg in front of you.

03:48.940 --> 03:52.940
There will be some ice cracks on the iceberg.

03:52.940 --> 03:57.940
As the iceberg flows, these cracks will change its position.

03:57.940 --> 04:04.940
If you have a satellite today, you can take a picture of the iceberg every once in a while.

04:04.940 --> 04:14.940
In this way, you can look at these pictures and calculate the movement speed of each crack on the iceberg.

04:14.940 --> 04:18.940
In this way, you can calculate the movement speed of the entire iceberg.

04:18.940 --> 04:26.940
This example is one of my many research plans.

04:26.940 --> 04:31.940
Although most of my research plans are not complete, most of them are like this.

04:31.940 --> 04:36.940
It is to use a very rich set of satellite data to monitor the changes in the ice circle.

04:36.940 --> 04:46.940
This ice circle includes the ice on the earth, including the sea ice, and even the ice on other planets.

04:46.940 --> 04:49.940
Most of these changes are physical changes.

04:49.940 --> 04:57.940
For example, the speed of the iceberg, the change in the water time, the change in the water time of the iceberg, or other physical parameters.

04:57.940 --> 05:07.940
These parameters have a very deep connection to the entire field of earth science, especially the field of global change.

05:07.940 --> 05:18.940
When I joined Cornell in 2015, I started to put my research center on ice science.

05:18.940 --> 05:23.940
I have been doing this for about 6 or 7 years.

05:24.940 --> 05:35.940
When I was using these satellite data, I found that the scale and the amount of data we used was so huge.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.940
Traditional analysis methods sometimes seem to be less efficient.

05:41.940 --> 05:53.940
I have been thinking about how to maintain the efficiency of analysis and academic communication while using a lot of data.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.940
For me, the answer is open science.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.940
This is the era of big data.

05:58.940 --> 06:08.940
Open science means that all the details of your research should be as open as possible to the public.

06:08.940 --> 06:13.940
For example, open your data so that others can easily access it.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.940
Upload your original code or city code.

06:16.940 --> 06:21.940
Everyone can Google your tool as long as they need it.

06:21.940 --> 06:27.940
Even when you have some research results, you can upload your research results.

06:27.940 --> 06:29.940
Whether it's a picture or a video, upload it.

06:29.940 --> 06:34.940
Even cooperate with the media to promote your research.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.940
These things are all open science.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.940
Although it sounds simple, it's actually quite difficult to do.

06:41.940 --> 06:52.940
Because you will find that when you really want to open all your things, data, city code, notes, and results, there will be some challenges.

06:52.940 --> 07:00.940
These challenges are why I joined the Jupiter Meteors team and why I am doing this project now.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.940
So let's talk about Jupiter first.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.940
How much do you know about Jupiter?

07:07.940 --> 07:09.940
This is a public opinion survey.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.940
If you have seen the chat room, I have already posted a link.

07:12.940 --> 07:18.940
You can rename or type your name.

07:18.940 --> 07:19.940
It doesn't matter, I won't confirm.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.940
But you can choose how much you know about Jupiter.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.940
Let me know about everyone's background.

07:27.940 --> 07:38.940
It seems that everyone has heard of Jupiter.

07:38.940 --> 07:50.940
About two-thirds of people have used Notebook or Jupiter Lab.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.940
One-third of the people are using it every day.

07:54.940 --> 07:59.940
It seems that everyone has a certain degree of understanding of Jupiter.

07:59.940 --> 08:03.940
Oh, I have increased to 7.3.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.940
Thank you for your vote.

08:05.940 --> 08:10.940
Everyone voted, so let's move on to the next one.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.940
There will be other questions later, so let's move on to the next video.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.940
If you want me to define what Jupiter is,

08:20.940 --> 08:28.940
I would say that Jupiter is actually a homework system for quantum mechanics.

08:28.940 --> 08:35.940
A homework system means that it can help you complete a task you want to complete.

08:35.940 --> 08:39.940
Of course, your task may have a lot of different work elements.

08:39.940 --> 08:46.940
Jupiter provides different tools to help you meet different needs in your task.

08:47.940 --> 08:51.940
Let me give you an example.

08:51.940 --> 08:55.940
Let's say you have a research idea in your mind.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.940
Then it starts to take shape.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.940
Then you start to explore.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.940
Hey, does this research idea make sense?

09:01.940 --> 09:05.940
You may want to use your computer to download some data.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.940
Then write some programs to analyze.

09:08.940 --> 09:12.940
Initial analysis to see if things are what you think they are.

09:13.940 --> 09:18.940
When you are sure that this project is developable,

09:18.940 --> 09:27.940
you may want to use more resources, such as computing resources.

09:27.940 --> 09:34.940
Or you may want to find other co-authors to implement this project.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.940
To analyze large amounts of data.

09:37.940 --> 09:44.940
Jupiter's tool is to tie all these things together.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.940
So that when you are looking for data,

09:48.940 --> 09:53.940
or when you are doing mass computing,

09:53.940 --> 09:56.940
or when you are cooperating with others,

09:56.940 --> 09:59.940
you can have a common platform to communicate with each other.

09:59.940 --> 10:05.940
You will notice that I put IPython in the center circle.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.940
This is because IPython is actually the predecessor of Jupyter.

10:10.940 --> 10:16.940
IPython was designed by Fernando PÃ©rez 20 years ago.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.940
The original purpose was to write code.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.940
When you are analyzing data,

10:21.940 --> 10:24.940
you want to be able to present what the data looks like in real time.

10:24.940 --> 10:28.940
This concept was invented with IPython.

10:28.940 --> 10:30.940
Then it gradually became popular.

10:30.940 --> 10:35.940
Now we put this project in the next generation of Jupyter.

10:35.940 --> 10:40.940
When we design Jupyter,

10:40.940 --> 10:53.940
in addition to allowing Jupyter tools to allow you to analyze data science,

10:53.940 --> 10:57.940
we also have a very big goal.

10:57.940 --> 11:02.940
We want to be able to communicate with others very well and efficiently

11:02.940 --> 11:08.940
at any stage of the user's use of these tools.

11:08.940 --> 11:12.940
For example, Jupyter Notebook is a file.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.940
You can easily copy it to others.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.940
Then others can get the file directly.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.940
If you have used JupyterHub,

11:19.940 --> 11:22.940
it is actually like a server.

11:22.940 --> 11:26.940
Everyone can log into this server as a different user.

11:26.940 --> 11:31.940
They will save the same image interface.

11:31.940 --> 11:35.940
This interface is based on JupyterLab.

11:35.940 --> 11:38.940
On this platform,

11:38.940 --> 11:42.940
they can use the same data freely.

11:42.940 --> 11:44.940
You can develop different cities.

11:44.940 --> 11:52.940
Others in your team can easily see your city

11:52.940 --> 11:54.940
and communicate directly.

11:55.940 --> 11:56.940
So for some people,

11:56.940 --> 11:59.940
Jupyter provides these tools

11:59.940 --> 12:03.940
to promote a very good community discussion.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.940
Some people think that Jupyter actually represents

12:05.940 --> 12:10.940
a community formed by people using Jupyter.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.940
Among so many tools,

12:12.940 --> 12:17.940
Jupyter has a core tool called Jupyter Notebook.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.940
It used to be called IPython Notebook,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.940
but now it's called Jupyter Notebook.

12:21.940 --> 12:22.940
Now that you've used it,

12:22.940 --> 12:24.940
let's jump over to it.

12:24.940 --> 12:27.940
It's basically a file.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.940
You can save it with a browser.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.940
After saving,

12:33.940 --> 12:34.940
you can see that

12:34.940 --> 12:36.940
this is a professional format

12:36.940 --> 12:38.940
for displaying text and mathematical formulas.

12:38.940 --> 12:39.940
In the same file,

12:39.940 --> 12:41.940
you can construct your city code.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.940
You can write city code and execute it.

12:44.940 --> 12:46.940
You can display interactive results.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.940
You can adjust the parameters here.

12:50.940 --> 12:54.940
You can see what the final image looks like.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.940
The last step is

12:55.940 --> 13:00.940
to simply pass the entire notebook to others

13:00.940 --> 13:06.940
so that they can 100% re-study it.

13:06.940 --> 13:07.940
Here's a picture

13:07.940 --> 13:09.940
to give you a little insight

13:09.940 --> 13:10.940
into how Jupyter Notebook

13:10.940 --> 13:13.940
achieved this goal.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.940
First, when you open a notebook,

13:16.940 --> 13:20.940
it's actually the notebook's service

13:20.940 --> 13:23.940
that turns your computer into a server.

13:23.940 --> 13:27.940
Users need to use

13:27.940 --> 13:30.940
a browser and HTTP protocol

13:30.940 --> 13:34.940
to store the content on the server.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.940
The user's operations

13:37.940 --> 13:38.940
on the server

13:38.940 --> 13:42.940
will be recorded in the notebook file.

13:42.940 --> 13:46.940
When the user needs to compute,

13:46.940 --> 13:49.940
the server will call a computing core,

13:49.940 --> 13:51.940
which is the kernel.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.940
This core may be Python,

13:54.940 --> 13:56.940
but in fact,

13:56.940 --> 13:58.940
if you have a good setup,

13:58.940 --> 14:00.940
it can also use other cores to compute,

14:00.940 --> 14:06.940
such as R, C++, or even Julia.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.940
In the most general use case,

14:08.940 --> 14:10.940
your notebook server

14:10.940 --> 14:12.940
is installed on your own computer.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.940
Your notebook file is also on your computer.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.940
But we can also use the same logic

14:17.940 --> 14:19.940
to install the server

14:19.940 --> 14:21.940
on cloud computing resources

14:21.940 --> 14:22.940
or even on HPC,

14:22.940 --> 14:25.940
which is a supercomputer.

14:25.940 --> 14:26.940
In this way,

14:26.940 --> 14:28.940
these cloud computing resources

14:28.940 --> 14:29.940
or supercomputers

14:29.940 --> 14:30.940
can be upgraded

14:30.940 --> 14:32.940
to become your data processing center.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.940
You can directly log in

14:34.940 --> 14:36.940
to these cloud computing resources

14:36.940 --> 14:39.940
and open your program.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.940
You can get or read data

14:41.940 --> 14:43.940
and analyze it

14:43.940 --> 14:47.940
directly on the same interface.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.940
In this way,

14:49.940 --> 14:51.940
your personal computer

14:51.940 --> 14:53.940
is a place

14:53.940 --> 14:55.940
where you can save

14:55.940 --> 14:57.940
typing and reading results.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.940
Most of the computing

15:00.940 --> 15:02.940
is done on the cloud.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.940
This is what we hope to achieve

15:04.940 --> 15:07.940
through Jupyter Notebook.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.940
That's all for Jupyter.

15:12.940 --> 15:13.940
It's very simple.

15:13.940 --> 15:14.940
Next, I'd like to ask

15:14.940 --> 15:15.940
how well you know about

15:15.940 --> 15:16.940
earth science.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.940
There are five statements here.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.940
They are shallow and deep.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.940
Please choose one

15:23.940 --> 15:24.940
according to

15:24.940 --> 15:26.940
your knowledge level.

15:28.940 --> 15:30.940
Oh, it seems

15:31.940 --> 15:35.940
the result is a little weird.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.940
It seems that

15:41.940 --> 15:43.940
your knowledge about

15:43.940 --> 15:45.940
earth science is

15:45.940 --> 15:47.940
scattered.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.940
It's on average

15:49.940 --> 15:51.940
between A and D.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.940
Some people seem to

15:55.940 --> 15:58.940
be familiar with earth science.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.940
But some people

16:00.940 --> 16:02.940
may not know

16:02.940 --> 16:04.940
what we are doing now.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.940
But it doesn't matter.

16:06.940 --> 16:08.940
Next,

16:08.940 --> 16:09.940
I won't tell you

16:09.940 --> 16:10.940
what earth science is.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.940
But what I want to say is

16:12.940 --> 16:14.940
what challenges we face

16:14.940 --> 16:15.940
as earth scientists.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.940
And how we can solve

16:17.940 --> 16:18.940
these challenges

16:18.940 --> 16:20.940
through Jupyter.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.940
Have you finished voting?

16:25.940 --> 16:26.940
OK, let's move on

16:26.940 --> 16:28.940
to the next video.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.940
For most people,

16:33.940 --> 16:34.940
when it comes to earth science,

16:34.940 --> 16:35.940
you may think

16:35.940 --> 16:37.940
it's just a group of scientists

16:37.940 --> 16:39.940
going out into the wild.

16:39.940 --> 16:40.940
They collect samples,

16:40.940 --> 16:41.940
bring them back to the lab,

16:41.940 --> 16:42.940
analyze them,

16:42.940 --> 16:43.940
study them,

16:43.940 --> 16:45.940
and then write a paper.

16:45.940 --> 16:46.940
That's it.

16:46.940 --> 16:47.940
That's right.

16:47.940 --> 16:48.940
Traditionally,

16:48.940 --> 16:49.940
earth science

16:49.940 --> 16:50.940
is basically like this.

16:50.940 --> 16:51.940
For example,

16:51.940 --> 16:52.940
this picture.

16:52.940 --> 16:53.940
I took this picture

16:53.940 --> 16:55.940
7 or 8 years ago

16:55.940 --> 16:57.940
with a Japanese

16:57.940 --> 16:59.940
volcanic scientist,

16:59.940 --> 17:01.940
Shogo Kimura.

17:02.940 --> 17:03.940
We took this picture

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
when we were doing

17:04.940 --> 17:06.940
field research in a big oil pit.

17:07.940 --> 17:08.940
Traditionally,

17:08.940 --> 17:09.940
there's not much information

17:09.940 --> 17:10.940
about earth science.

17:10.940 --> 17:11.940
Because the information

17:11.940 --> 17:12.940
has to be obtained

17:12.940 --> 17:13.940
from the wild.

17:13.940 --> 17:14.940
Most of the information

17:14.940 --> 17:15.940
is written on your notebook.

17:15.940 --> 17:16.940
Just a few lines.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.940
And then you go back

17:17.940 --> 17:19.940
to the lab and process it.

17:19.940 --> 17:20.940
But with the emergence

17:20.940 --> 17:21.940
of new technology

17:21.940 --> 17:23.940
and new methods,

17:23.940 --> 17:24.940
for example,

17:24.940 --> 17:25.940
like this one.

17:25.940 --> 17:26.940
This picture,

17:26.940 --> 17:28.940
although this picture

17:28.940 --> 17:29.940
is very old,

17:29.940 --> 17:30.940
it's already 7 or 8 years old.

17:30.940 --> 17:31.940
But when we were

17:31.940 --> 17:32.940
out in the wild,

17:32.940 --> 17:33.940
we actually used

17:33.940 --> 17:34.940
instrument support.

17:34.940 --> 17:35.940
We wanted to measure

17:35.940 --> 17:36.940
the temperature of the surface

17:36.940 --> 17:37.940
of a big oil pit.

17:37.940 --> 17:38.940
So we brought

17:38.940 --> 17:40.940
a infrared camera.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.940
The information

17:42.940 --> 17:44.940
involved in the infrared camera

17:44.940 --> 17:45.940
is not at all like

17:45.940 --> 17:46.940
the information

17:46.940 --> 17:47.940
you would write

17:47.940 --> 17:49.940
on a wild notebook.

17:49.940 --> 17:50.940
You will find that

17:50.940 --> 17:51.940
this information

17:51.940 --> 17:53.940
is already digitized

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
at the very beginning.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.940
And it can provide

17:56.940 --> 17:57.940
some information

17:57.940 --> 17:58.940
that is continuous

17:58.940 --> 18:00.940
in time and space.

18:00.940 --> 18:01.940
That is to say,

18:01.940 --> 18:03.940
the size of the data

18:03.940 --> 18:04.940
itself

18:04.940 --> 18:06.940
will become very large.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.940
It used to be one or two strokes,

18:08.940 --> 18:09.940
but now there are several,

18:09.940 --> 18:11.940
just different dimensions,

18:11.940 --> 18:13.940
and then several megabytes

18:13.940 --> 18:14.940
or several gigabytes of data

18:14.940 --> 18:16.940
waiting for you to analyze.

18:16.940 --> 18:17.940
This is just

18:17.940 --> 18:18.940
the part of the field investigation.

18:18.940 --> 18:19.940
But now

18:19.940 --> 18:21.940
we have some technology

18:21.940 --> 18:22.940
that allows us

18:22.940 --> 18:23.940
to collect data

18:23.940 --> 18:24.940
without going out in the wild.

18:24.940 --> 18:25.940
For example,

18:25.940 --> 18:26.940
you can use a drone

18:26.940 --> 18:28.940
or a higher-end,

18:28.940 --> 18:29.940
or farther,

18:29.940 --> 18:30.940
satellite data

18:31.940 --> 18:32.940
to help you analyze

18:32.940 --> 18:34.940
what is happening on Earth.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.940
For example,

18:37.940 --> 18:39.940
now,

18:39.940 --> 18:40.940
a satellite,

18:40.940 --> 18:42.940
a Earth observation satellite,

18:42.940 --> 18:43.940
can produce

18:43.940 --> 18:44.940
several TB of data

18:44.940 --> 18:46.940
every day.

18:46.940 --> 18:47.940
Think about it,

18:47.940 --> 18:48.940
we have dozens of

18:48.940 --> 18:49.940
Earth observation satellites

18:49.940 --> 18:51.940
flying in the sky,

18:51.940 --> 18:52.940
and then

18:52.940 --> 18:53.940
we also observe

18:53.940 --> 18:54.940
for a long time,

18:54.940 --> 18:55.940
not just one day,

18:55.940 --> 18:56.940
but also several decades,

18:56.940 --> 18:57.940
even several years.

18:57.940 --> 18:58.940
So,

18:58.940 --> 18:59.940
the amount of data

18:59.940 --> 19:00.940
added up

19:00.940 --> 19:01.940
is so huge

19:01.940 --> 19:02.940
that no one knows

19:02.940 --> 19:04.940
how to deal with it.

19:04.940 --> 19:05.940
This is a problem

19:05.940 --> 19:06.940
that observers

19:06.940 --> 19:07.940
will face.

19:07.940 --> 19:08.940
On the other hand,

19:08.940 --> 19:09.940
simulators

19:09.940 --> 19:10.940
actually

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
have the same problem,

19:11.940 --> 19:12.940
because they will say,

19:12.940 --> 19:13.940
wow,

19:13.940 --> 19:14.940
now I have so much data,

19:14.940 --> 19:15.940
so I can improve

19:15.940 --> 19:16.940
the resolution of

19:16.940 --> 19:17.940
my Earth model.

19:17.940 --> 19:18.940
I can analyze

19:18.940 --> 19:19.940
for example,

19:19.940 --> 19:20.940
what happened

19:20.940 --> 19:21.940
in a few days,

19:21.940 --> 19:22.940
a few minutes,

19:22.940 --> 19:23.940
a few seconds,

19:23.940 --> 19:24.940
or

19:24.940 --> 19:25.940
what happened

19:25.940 --> 19:26.940
in a few meters

19:26.940 --> 19:27.940
or a few centimeters

19:28.940 --> 19:29.940
.

19:29.940 --> 19:30.940
Then,

19:30.940 --> 19:31.940
they can improve

19:31.940 --> 19:32.940
the accuracy of their models,

19:32.940 --> 19:33.940
and then

19:33.940 --> 19:34.940
this large amount of observation data

19:34.940 --> 19:35.940
can be used to verify

19:35.940 --> 19:36.940
whether their models

19:36.940 --> 19:37.940
are accurate.

19:37.940 --> 19:38.940
But no matter which one,

19:38.940 --> 19:39.940
whether it is observed

19:39.940 --> 19:40.940
or simulated,

19:40.940 --> 19:41.940
you have to deal with

19:41.940 --> 19:42.940
and analyze

19:42.940 --> 19:44.940
such large-scale data,

19:44.940 --> 19:45.940
you have to have

19:45.940 --> 19:46.940
relative computing resources.

19:48.940 --> 19:49.940
Not to mention,

19:50.940 --> 19:51.940
there may be many types

19:51.940 --> 19:52.940
of data

19:52.940 --> 19:53.940
in Earth science.

19:53.940 --> 19:54.940
For example,

19:54.940 --> 19:55.940
if you are a

19:55.940 --> 19:56.940
Earth observation satellite today,

19:56.940 --> 19:57.940
if you have a camera

19:57.940 --> 19:58.940
installed on it,

19:58.940 --> 19:59.940
then the data you collect

19:59.940 --> 20:00.940
is basically

20:00.940 --> 20:01.940
a photo,

20:01.940 --> 20:02.940
a video,

20:02.940 --> 20:03.940
a bit like a

20:03.940 --> 20:04.940
telescope,

20:04.940 --> 20:05.940
like this picture on the left.

20:05.940 --> 20:06.940
It's a video,

20:06.940 --> 20:07.940
uh,

20:07.940 --> 20:08.940
not a video,

20:08.940 --> 20:09.940
sorry,

20:09.940 --> 20:10.940
a photo.

20:10.940 --> 20:11.940
But,

20:11.940 --> 20:12.940
there are also other types of data

20:12.940 --> 20:13.940
that you may be able to collect,

20:13.940 --> 20:14.940
for example,

20:14.940 --> 20:15.940
you may be able to collect

20:15.940 --> 20:16.940
some geographical space data,

20:16.940 --> 20:17.940
and then they have

20:17.940 --> 20:18.940
so-called,

20:18.940 --> 20:19.940
uh,

20:19.940 --> 20:20.940
maybe their

20:20.940 --> 20:21.940
scattered

20:21.940 --> 20:22.940
bit by bit

20:22.940 --> 20:23.940
all over the place,

20:23.940 --> 20:24.940
and maybe they can

20:24.940 --> 20:25.940
form a certain

20:25.940 --> 20:26.940
shape,

20:26.940 --> 20:27.940
like a line,

20:27.940 --> 20:28.940
or a polygon,

20:28.940 --> 20:29.940
and so on.

20:29.940 --> 20:30.940
What about

20:30.940 --> 20:31.940
the different data structures?

20:31.940 --> 20:32.940
How do you

20:32.940 --> 20:33.940
put them together

20:33.940 --> 20:34.940
and analyze them?

20:34.940 --> 20:35.940
This is what

20:35.940 --> 20:36.940
Earth scientists

20:36.940 --> 20:37.940
are currently

20:37.940 --> 20:38.940
trying very hard

20:38.940 --> 20:39.940
to solve.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.940
And,

20:41.940 --> 20:42.940
these,

20:42.940 --> 20:43.940
and most of these

20:43.940 --> 20:44.940
different types of data

20:44.940 --> 20:45.940
have so-called

20:45.940 --> 20:46.940
background data,

20:46.940 --> 20:47.940
which is

20:47.940 --> 20:48.940
called metadata

20:48.940 --> 20:49.940
in English.

20:49.940 --> 20:50.940
Uh,

20:50.940 --> 20:51.940
its concept is,

20:51.940 --> 20:52.940
uh,

20:52.940 --> 20:53.940
for example,

20:53.940 --> 20:54.940
let's make a satellite image today.

20:54.940 --> 20:55.940
This satellite image

20:55.940 --> 20:56.940
actually has other data,

20:56.940 --> 20:57.940
such as,

20:57.940 --> 20:58.940
uh,

20:58.940 --> 20:59.940
which satellite shot it,

20:59.940 --> 21:00.940
when was it shot,

21:00.940 --> 21:01.940
and then,

21:01.940 --> 21:02.940
what was the

21:02.940 --> 21:03.940
angle of the orbit

21:03.940 --> 21:04.940
at that time,

21:04.940 --> 21:05.940
uh,

21:05.940 --> 21:06.940
and other orbit parameters,

21:06.940 --> 21:07.940
and then,

21:07.940 --> 21:08.940
which wave

21:08.940 --> 21:09.940
was the image taken in,

21:09.940 --> 21:10.940
was it a visible wave,

21:10.940 --> 21:11.940
or a infrared wave,

21:11.940 --> 21:12.940
and so on,

21:12.940 --> 21:13.940
and so on,

21:13.940 --> 21:14.940
and so on.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.940
Any data

21:15.940 --> 21:16.940
about this image

21:16.940 --> 21:17.940
is considered

21:17.940 --> 21:18.940
background data.

21:18.940 --> 21:19.940
Now,

21:19.940 --> 21:20.940
these background data

21:20.940 --> 21:21.940
may not have

21:21.940 --> 21:22.940
much impact

21:22.940 --> 21:23.940
when you

21:23.940 --> 21:24.940
make a satellite image,

21:24.940 --> 21:25.940
but if you

21:25.940 --> 21:26.940
tell others today

21:26.940 --> 21:27.940
how to

21:27.940 --> 21:28.940
re-study,

21:28.940 --> 21:29.940
or

21:29.940 --> 21:30.940
what you need to

21:30.940 --> 21:31.940
consider when you

21:31.940 --> 21:32.940
make a result,

21:32.940 --> 21:33.940
what you need to

21:33.940 --> 21:34.940
pay attention to,

21:34.940 --> 21:35.940
then you may

21:35.940 --> 21:36.940
have to flip the

21:36.940 --> 21:37.940
background data.

21:37.940 --> 21:38.940
In other words,

21:38.940 --> 21:39.940
in most cases,

21:39.940 --> 21:40.940
these background data

21:40.940 --> 21:41.940
are actually

21:41.940 --> 21:42.940
to be passed

21:42.940 --> 21:43.940
along with

21:43.940 --> 21:44.940
your data.

21:44.940 --> 21:45.940
So,

21:45.940 --> 21:46.940
when we

21:46.940 --> 21:47.940
communicate,

21:47.940 --> 21:48.940
when we

21:48.940 --> 21:49.940
do academic communication,

21:49.940 --> 21:50.940
how do we do

21:50.940 --> 21:51.940
this?

21:51.940 --> 21:52.940
To be honest,

21:52.940 --> 21:53.940
I don't know

21:53.940 --> 21:54.940
if it's true,

21:54.940 --> 21:55.940
but some people

21:55.940 --> 21:56.940
say that

21:56.940 --> 21:57.940
scientists on

21:57.940 --> 21:58.940
Earth spend

21:58.940 --> 21:59.940
about 80% of

21:59.940 --> 22:00.940
their time

22:00.940 --> 22:01.940
looking for

22:01.940 --> 22:02.940
data.

22:02.940 --> 22:03.940
Here,

22:03.940 --> 22:04.940
I want to

22:04.940 --> 22:05.940
give you

22:05.940 --> 22:06.940
an example.

22:06.940 --> 22:07.940
This is

22:07.940 --> 22:08.940
a screen

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
screenshot.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.940
I want to

22:10.940 --> 22:11.940
use this

22:11.940 --> 22:12.940
screenshot

22:12.940 --> 22:13.940
to share

22:13.940 --> 22:14.940
with you

22:14.940 --> 22:15.940
that

22:15.940 --> 22:16.940
finding data

22:16.940 --> 22:17.940
is really

22:17.940 --> 22:18.940
difficult.

22:18.940 --> 22:19.940
It sounds

22:19.940 --> 22:20.940
simple,

22:20.940 --> 22:21.940
but it's

22:21.940 --> 22:22.940
not.

22:22.940 --> 22:23.940
Here,

22:23.940 --> 22:24.940
I want to

22:24.940 --> 22:25.940
find

22:25.940 --> 22:26.940
data on

22:26.940 --> 22:27.940
the

22:27.940 --> 22:28.940
surface

22:28.940 --> 22:29.940
reflectance

22:29.940 --> 22:30.940
rate.

22:30.940 --> 22:31.940
I want to

22:31.940 --> 22:32.940
find out

22:32.940 --> 22:33.940
the surface

22:33.940 --> 22:34.940
reflectance

22:34.940 --> 22:35.940
rate

22:35.940 --> 22:36.940
of Taiwan

22:36.940 --> 22:37.940
at a

22:37.940 --> 22:38.940
certain

22:38.940 --> 22:39.940
time.

22:39.940 --> 22:40.940
I know

22:40.940 --> 22:41.940
there is

22:41.940 --> 22:42.940
a device

22:42.940 --> 22:43.940
called

22:43.940 --> 22:44.940
MODIS

22:44.940 --> 22:45.940
that can

22:45.940 --> 22:46.940
observe

22:46.940 --> 22:47.940
this

22:47.940 --> 22:48.940
data.

22:48.940 --> 22:49.940
MODIS

22:49.940 --> 22:50.940
is a

22:50.940 --> 22:51.940
website

22:51.940 --> 22:52.940
called

22:52.940 --> 22:53.940
NASA Earth

22:53.940 --> 22:54.940
Data.

22:54.940 --> 22:55.940
It is

22:55.940 --> 22:56.940
completely

22:56.940 --> 22:57.940
open.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.940
Anyone

22:58.940 --> 22:59.940
can download

22:59.940 --> 23:00.940
this

23:00.940 --> 23:01.940
data

23:01.940 --> 23:02.940
if they

23:02.940 --> 23:03.940
know

23:03.940 --> 23:04.940
how to

23:04.940 --> 23:05.940
search

23:05.940 --> 23:06.940
and store

23:06.940 --> 23:07.940
data.

23:07.940 --> 23:08.940
The problem

23:08.940 --> 23:09.940
is that

23:09.940 --> 23:10.940
this

23:10.940 --> 23:11.940
interface

23:11.940 --> 23:12.940
is really

23:12.940 --> 23:13.940
complicated.

23:13.940 --> 23:14.940
First,

23:14.940 --> 23:15.940
you need to

23:15.940 --> 23:16.940
go to

23:16.940 --> 23:17.940
Earth

23:17.940 --> 23:18.940
Data

23:18.940 --> 23:19.940
and

23:19.940 --> 23:20.940
search

23:20.940 --> 23:21.940
for

23:21.940 --> 23:22.940
this

23:22.940 --> 23:23.940
data.

23:23.940 --> 23:24.940
Why is there

23:24.940 --> 23:25.940
so many

23:25.940 --> 23:26.940
data?

23:26.940 --> 23:27.940
Because

23:27.940 --> 23:28.940
MODIS

23:28.940 --> 23:29.940
is a

23:29.940 --> 23:30.940
satellite

23:30.940 --> 23:31.940
camera,

23:31.940 --> 23:32.940
but

23:32.940 --> 23:33.940
when

23:33.940 --> 23:34.940
processing

23:34.940 --> 23:35.940
data,

23:35.940 --> 23:36.940
there are

23:36.940 --> 23:37.940
many

23:37.940 --> 23:38.940
levels.

23:38.940 --> 23:39.940
Each

23:39.940 --> 23:40.940
level

23:40.940 --> 23:41.940
has

23:41.940 --> 23:42.940
different

23:42.940 --> 23:43.940
scientific

23:43.940 --> 23:44.940
values,

23:44.940 --> 23:45.940
so

23:45.940 --> 23:46.940
they

23:46.940 --> 23:47.940
classify

23:47.940 --> 23:48.940
them

23:48.940 --> 23:49.940
in

23:49.940 --> 23:50.940
different

23:50.940 --> 23:51.940
ways.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.940
So

23:52.940 --> 23:53.940
first of

23:53.940 --> 23:54.940
all,

23:54.940 --> 23:55.940
you have

23:55.940 --> 23:56.940
to know

23:56.940 --> 23:57.940
the

23:57.940 --> 23:58.940
name of

23:58.940 --> 23:59.940
this

23:59.940 --> 24:00.940
data

24:00.940 --> 24:01.940
very

24:01.940 --> 24:02.940
clearly.

24:02.940 --> 24:03.940
Then,

24:03.940 --> 24:04.940
of course,

24:04.940 --> 24:05.940
731

24:05.940 --> 24:06.940
data

24:06.940 --> 24:07.940
levels.

24:07.940 --> 24:08.940
Then,

24:08.940 --> 24:09.940
you can

24:09.940 --> 24:10.940
draw

24:10.940 --> 24:11.940
where you

24:11.940 --> 24:12.940
want to

24:12.940 --> 24:13.940
search on

24:13.940 --> 24:14.940
Earth.

24:14.940 --> 24:15.940
For

24:15.940 --> 24:16.940
example,

24:16.940 --> 24:17.940
I put

24:17.940 --> 24:18.940
this

24:18.940 --> 24:19.940
data

24:19.940 --> 24:20.940
in

24:20.940 --> 24:21.940
my

24:21.940 --> 24:22.940
computer.

24:22.940 --> 24:23.940
Then,

24:23.940 --> 24:24.940
you have

24:24.940 --> 24:25.940
to know

24:25.940 --> 24:26.940
which

24:26.940 --> 24:27.940
time and

24:27.940 --> 24:28.940
which

24:28.940 --> 24:29.940
time point

24:29.940 --> 24:30.940
I want to

24:30.940 --> 24:31.940
capture.

24:31.940 --> 24:32.940
Then,

24:32.940 --> 24:33.940
press the

24:33.940 --> 24:34.940
download

24:34.940 --> 24:35.940
link

24:35.940 --> 24:36.940
one by one

24:36.940 --> 24:37.940
and

24:37.940 --> 24:38.940
download it

24:38.940 --> 24:39.940
to your

24:39.940 --> 24:40.940
computer.

24:40.940 --> 24:41.940
Finally,

24:41.940 --> 24:42.940
put these

24:42.940 --> 24:43.940
files in the

24:43.940 --> 24:44.940
same

24:44.940 --> 24:45.940
folder one

24:45.940 --> 24:46.940
by one

24:46.940 --> 24:47.940
and

24:47.940 --> 24:48.940
download it.

24:48.940 --> 24:49.940
In

24:49.940 --> 24:50.940
my

24:50.940 --> 24:51.940
case,

24:51.940 --> 24:52.940
it may

24:52.940 --> 24:53.940
take two

24:53.940 --> 24:54.940
to three

24:54.940 --> 24:55.940
days,

24:55.940 --> 24:56.940
or even

24:56.940 --> 24:57.940
longer.

24:57.940 --> 24:58.940
And

24:58.940 --> 24:59.940
this is still

24:59.940 --> 25:00.940
a relatively

25:00.940 --> 25:01.940
relaxed

25:01.940 --> 25:02.940
situation.

25:02.940 --> 25:03.940
If

25:03.940 --> 25:04.940
you want to

25:04.940 --> 25:05.940
find

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
less

25:06.940 --> 25:07.940
open

25:07.940 --> 25:08.940
data

25:08.940 --> 25:09.940
today,

25:09.940 --> 25:10.940
for

25:10.940 --> 25:11.940
example,

25:11.940 --> 25:12.940
German

25:12.940 --> 25:13.940
or French

25:13.940 --> 25:14.940
space

25:14.940 --> 25:15.940
races,

25:15.940 --> 25:16.940
you

25:16.940 --> 25:17.940
can

25:17.940 --> 25:18.940
search for

25:18.940 --> 25:19.940
this

25:19.940 --> 25:20.940
content.

25:20.940 --> 25:21.940
So,

25:21.940 --> 25:22.940
we have

25:22.940 --> 25:23.940
these

25:23.940 --> 25:24.940
difficulties,

25:24.940 --> 25:25.940
which

25:25.940 --> 25:26.940
leads me

25:26.940 --> 25:27.940
to say that

25:27.940 --> 25:28.940
I personally

25:28.940 --> 25:29.940
think that

25:29.940 --> 25:30.940
data

25:30.940 --> 25:31.940
science,

25:31.940 --> 25:32.940
including

25:32.940 --> 25:33.940
how to

25:33.940 --> 25:34.940
obtain

25:34.940 --> 25:35.940
data,

25:35.940 --> 25:36.940
and

25:36.940 --> 25:37.940
how to

25:37.940 --> 25:38.940
process and

25:38.940 --> 25:39.940
analyze

25:39.940 --> 25:40.940
these

25:40.940 --> 25:41.940
data,

25:41.940 --> 25:42.940
data

25:42.940 --> 25:43.940
science

25:43.940 --> 25:44.940
itself

25:44.940 --> 25:45.940
is a

25:45.940 --> 25:46.940
very

25:46.940 --> 25:47.940
complex

25:47.940 --> 25:48.940
field.

25:48.940 --> 25:49.940
So,

25:49.940 --> 25:50.940
I

25:50.940 --> 25:51.940
will

25:51.940 --> 25:52.940
hold

25:52.940 --> 25:53.940
this

25:53.940 --> 25:54.940
conference

25:54.940 --> 25:55.940
once in

25:55.940 --> 25:56.940
the United

25:56.940 --> 25:57.940
States.

25:57.940 --> 25:58.940
There

25:58.940 --> 25:59.940
will be

25:59.940 --> 26:00.940
thousands or

26:00.940 --> 26:01.940
tens of

26:01.940 --> 26:02.940
thousands of

26:02.940 --> 26:03.940
researchers

26:03.940 --> 26:04.940
attending

26:04.940 --> 26:05.940
this

26:05.940 --> 26:06.940
conference

26:06.940 --> 26:07.940
and

26:07.940 --> 26:08.940
presenting

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
their

26:09.940 --> 26:10.940
research.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.940
At

26:11.940 --> 26:12.940
this

26:12.940 --> 26:13.940
conference,

26:13.940 --> 26:14.940
there

26:14.940 --> 26:15.940
will be

26:15.940 --> 26:16.940
scientific

26:16.940 --> 26:17.940
collaboration

26:17.940 --> 26:18.940
or

26:18.940 --> 26:19.940
if NASA

26:19.940 --> 26:20.940
has a

26:20.940 --> 26:21.940
new

26:21.940 --> 26:22.940
data machine

26:22.940 --> 26:23.940
and

26:23.940 --> 26:24.940
NASA

26:24.940 --> 26:25.940
people

26:25.940 --> 26:26.940
come and

26:26.940 --> 26:27.940
tell you

26:27.940 --> 26:28.940
how to

26:28.940 --> 26:29.940
use it.

26:29.940 --> 26:30.940
But

26:30.940 --> 26:31.940
last year,

26:31.940 --> 26:32.940
there were

26:32.940 --> 26:33.940
two

26:33.940 --> 26:34.940
workshops

26:34.940 --> 26:35.940
related to

26:35.940 --> 26:36.940
data

26:36.940 --> 26:37.940
science.

26:37.940 --> 26:38.940
One

26:38.940 --> 26:39.940
was

26:39.940 --> 26:40.940
how to

26:40.940 --> 26:41.940
use

26:41.940 --> 26:42.940
Python

26:42.940 --> 26:43.940
to

26:43.940 --> 26:44.940
analyze

26:44.940 --> 26:45.940
data.

26:45.940 --> 26:46.940
I

26:46.940 --> 26:47.940
personally

26:47.940 --> 26:48.940
think that

26:48.940 --> 26:49.940
this

26:49.940 --> 26:50.940
phenomenon

26:50.940 --> 26:51.940
happened

26:51.940 --> 26:52.940
recently.

26:52.940 --> 26:53.940
It

26:53.940 --> 26:54.940
happened

26:54.940 --> 26:55.940
less than

26:55.940 --> 26:56.940
one or

26:56.940 --> 26:57.940
two years

26:57.940 --> 26:58.940
ago,

26:58.940 --> 26:59.940
maybe

26:59.940 --> 27:00.940
2020 or

27:00.940 --> 27:01.940
2021.

27:01.940 --> 27:02.940
But

27:02.940 --> 27:03.940
I think

27:03.940 --> 27:04.940
this is

27:04.940 --> 27:05.940
the current

27:05.940 --> 27:06.940
trend.

27:06.940 --> 27:07.940
In the

27:07.940 --> 27:08.940
future,

27:08.940 --> 27:09.940
this trend

27:09.940 --> 27:10.940
will only

27:10.940 --> 27:11.940
increase

27:11.940 --> 27:12.940
as

27:12.940 --> 27:13.940
time

27:13.940 --> 27:14.940
goes

27:14.940 --> 27:15.940
by.

27:15.940 --> 27:16.940
So

27:16.940 --> 27:17.940
I

27:17.940 --> 27:18.940
think

27:18.940 --> 27:19.940
this

27:19.940 --> 27:20.940
trend

27:20.940 --> 27:21.940
will

27:21.940 --> 27:22.940
only

27:22.940 --> 27:23.940
increase

27:23.940 --> 27:24.940
as

27:24.940 --> 27:25.940
time

27:25.940 --> 27:26.940
goes

27:26.940 --> 27:27.940
by.

27:27.940 --> 27:28.940
So

27:28.940 --> 27:29.940
I

27:29.940 --> 27:30.940
think

27:30.940 --> 27:31.940
this

27:31.940 --> 27:32.940
trend

27:32.940 --> 27:33.940
will

27:33.940 --> 27:34.940
only

27:34.940 --> 27:35.940
increase

27:35.940 --> 27:36.940
as

27:36.940 --> 27:37.940
time

27:37.940 --> 27:38.940
goes

27:38.940 --> 27:39.940
by.

27:39.940 --> 27:40.940
Thank

27:40.940 --> 27:41.940
you.

28:11.940 --> 28:12.940
Thank

28:12.940 --> 28:13.940
you.

28:41.940 --> 28:42.940
So

28:42.940 --> 28:43.940
speaking of

28:43.940 --> 28:44.940
this,

28:44.940 --> 28:45.940
I would like to

28:45.940 --> 28:46.940
ask everyone

28:46.940 --> 28:47.940
what do you think

28:47.940 --> 28:48.940
is the most difficult

28:48.940 --> 28:49.940
thing to do

28:49.940 --> 28:50.940
in a research

28:50.940 --> 28:51.940
plan?

28:51.940 --> 28:52.940
Is it

28:52.940 --> 28:53.940
looking for

28:53.940 --> 28:54.940
data?

28:54.940 --> 28:55.940
Or

28:55.940 --> 28:56.940
analyzing

28:56.940 --> 28:57.940
data?

28:57.940 --> 28:58.940
Or

28:58.940 --> 28:59.940
promoting or

28:59.940 --> 29:00.940
sharing

29:00.940 --> 29:01.940
research

29:01.940 --> 29:02.940
results?

29:02.940 --> 29:03.940
Or

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
you are

29:04.940 --> 29:05.940
not

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
doing

29:06.940 --> 29:07.940
research at

29:07.940 --> 29:08.940
all?

29:08.940 --> 29:09.940
I

29:09.940 --> 29:10.940
see

29:10.940 --> 29:11.940
about

29:11.940 --> 29:12.940
half of

29:12.940 --> 29:13.940
you

29:13.940 --> 29:14.940
think

29:14.940 --> 29:15.940
writing

29:15.940 --> 29:16.940
articles,

29:16.940 --> 29:17.940
promoting

29:17.940 --> 29:18.940
or sharing

29:18.940 --> 29:19.940
research results

29:19.940 --> 29:20.940
is the

29:20.940 --> 29:21.940
most difficult.

29:21.940 --> 29:22.940
Half.

29:22.940 --> 29:23.940
There

29:23.940 --> 29:24.940
are

29:24.940 --> 29:25.940
really

29:25.940 --> 29:26.940
a lot.

29:26.940 --> 29:27.940
It's

29:27.940 --> 29:28.940
already

29:28.940 --> 29:29.940
more than

29:29.940 --> 29:30.940
half.

29:30.940 --> 29:31.940
And

29:31.940 --> 29:32.940
looking for

29:32.940 --> 29:33.940
data is

29:33.940 --> 29:34.940
about

29:34.940 --> 29:35.940
three times.

29:35.940 --> 29:36.940
And

29:36.940 --> 29:37.940
the rest

29:37.940 --> 29:38.940
is

29:38.940 --> 29:39.940
analyzing

29:39.940 --> 29:40.940
data.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
It looks like

29:41.940 --> 29:42.940
everyone has

29:42.940 --> 29:43.940
different ideas.

29:43.940 --> 29:44.940
Then

29:44.940 --> 29:45.940
these three

29:45.940 --> 29:46.940
aspects of

29:46.940 --> 29:47.940
research are

29:47.940 --> 29:48.940
difficult for

29:48.940 --> 29:49.940
some people.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.940
I have more than

29:50.940 --> 29:51.940
half

29:51.940 --> 29:52.940
who think

29:52.940 --> 29:53.940
promoting and

29:53.940 --> 29:54.940
sharing research

29:54.940 --> 29:55.940
results are the

29:55.940 --> 29:56.940
most difficult.

29:56.940 --> 29:57.940
That's

29:57.940 --> 29:58.940
right.

29:58.940 --> 29:59.940
Personally,

29:59.940 --> 30:00.940
if I had to

30:00.940 --> 30:01.940
choose,

30:01.940 --> 30:02.940
I would

30:02.940 --> 30:03.940
probably

30:03.940 --> 30:04.940
choose C

30:04.940 --> 30:05.940
or A.

30:05.940 --> 30:06.940
I'm not

30:06.940 --> 30:07.940
sure.

30:08.940 --> 30:09.940
The

30:09.940 --> 30:10.940
above

30:10.940 --> 30:11.940
questions

30:11.940 --> 30:12.940
are what

30:12.940 --> 30:13.940
Jupyter Meteor

30:13.940 --> 30:14.940
wants to

30:14.940 --> 30:15.940
solve.

30:15.940 --> 30:16.940
Let me

30:16.940 --> 30:17.940
look at

30:17.940 --> 30:18.940
Jupyter

30:18.940 --> 30:19.940
again.

30:19.940 --> 30:20.940
Jupyter

30:20.940 --> 30:21.940
itself is

30:21.940 --> 30:22.940
an ecosystem.

30:22.940 --> 30:23.940
In

30:23.940 --> 30:24.940
simple terms,

30:24.940 --> 30:25.940
in addition to

30:25.940 --> 30:26.940
Jupyter's

30:26.940 --> 30:27.940
own tools,

30:27.940 --> 30:28.940
there are

30:28.940 --> 30:29.940
many other

30:29.940 --> 30:30.940
tools.

30:30.940 --> 30:31.940
They may

30:31.940 --> 30:32.940
not be

30:32.940 --> 30:33.940
developed by

30:33.940 --> 30:34.940
the Jupyter

30:34.940 --> 30:35.940
team,

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
but

30:36.940 --> 30:37.940
Jupyter

30:37.940 --> 30:38.940
team

30:38.940 --> 30:39.940
often uses

30:39.940 --> 30:40.940
them because

30:40.940 --> 30:41.940
they can

30:41.940 --> 30:42.940
assist

30:42.940 --> 30:43.940
them in

30:43.940 --> 30:44.940
your

30:44.940 --> 30:45.940
research process.

30:45.940 --> 30:46.940
There are

30:46.940 --> 30:47.940
different

30:47.940 --> 30:48.940
areas.

30:48.940 --> 30:49.940
How to

30:49.940 --> 30:50.940
say?

30:50.940 --> 30:51.940
For example,

30:51.940 --> 30:52.940
you may

30:52.940 --> 30:53.940
use Python

30:53.940 --> 30:54.940
to write

30:54.940 --> 30:55.940
your program.

30:55.940 --> 30:56.940
When you

30:56.940 --> 30:57.940
use it,

30:57.940 --> 30:58.940
you may

30:58.940 --> 30:59.940
use some

30:59.940 --> 31:00.940
core components

31:00.940 --> 31:01.940
of Python.

31:01.940 --> 31:02.940
For example,

31:02.940 --> 31:03.940
you may

31:03.940 --> 31:04.940
use

31:04.940 --> 31:05.940
SciPy or

31:05.940 --> 31:06.940
you may

31:06.940 --> 31:07.940
use some

31:07.940 --> 31:08.940
more professional

31:08.940 --> 31:09.940
components.

31:09.940 --> 31:10.940
For example,

31:10.940 --> 31:11.940
if you want to

31:11.940 --> 31:12.940
do parallel

31:12.940 --> 31:13.940
computing,

31:13.940 --> 31:14.940
you may

31:14.940 --> 31:15.940
have heard of

31:15.940 --> 31:16.940
Dask or

31:16.940 --> 31:17.940
have used

31:17.940 --> 31:18.940
Dask.

31:18.940 --> 31:19.940
If you

31:19.940 --> 31:20.940
want to

31:20.940 --> 31:21.940
do image

31:21.940 --> 31:22.940
processing,

31:22.940 --> 31:23.940
I think

31:23.940 --> 31:24.940
you may

31:24.940 --> 31:25.940
have used

31:25.940 --> 31:26.940
Scikit-

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
image.

31:27.940 --> 31:28.940
In addition

31:28.940 --> 31:29.940
to these

31:29.940 --> 31:30.940
professional

31:30.940 --> 31:31.940
components,

31:31.940 --> 31:32.940
there are

31:32.940 --> 31:33.940
some

31:33.940 --> 31:34.940
components

31:34.940 --> 31:35.940
that

31:35.940 --> 31:36.940
are used

31:36.940 --> 31:37.940
for those

31:37.940 --> 31:38.940
who are

31:38.940 --> 31:39.940
dealing with

31:39.940 --> 31:40.940
astronomical

31:40.940 --> 31:41.940
observations.

31:41.940 --> 31:42.940
Syntax

31:42.940 --> 31:43.940
is used

31:43.940 --> 31:44.940
for those

31:44.940 --> 31:45.940
who are

31:45.940 --> 31:46.940
doing

31:46.940 --> 31:47.940
earth

31:47.940 --> 31:48.940
physics.

31:48.940 --> 31:49.940
It is

31:49.940 --> 31:50.940
used for

31:50.940 --> 31:51.940
those

31:51.940 --> 31:52.940
who

31:52.940 --> 31:53.940
are

31:53.940 --> 31:54.940
calculating

31:54.940 --> 31:55.940
geosystem

31:55.940 --> 31:56.940
or

31:56.940 --> 31:57.940
something

31:57.940 --> 31:58.940
like that.

31:58.940 --> 31:59.940
These

31:59.940 --> 32:00.940
different

32:00.940 --> 32:01.940
components

32:01.940 --> 32:02.940
have different

32:02.940 --> 32:03.940
areas

32:03.940 --> 32:04.940
and

32:04.940 --> 32:05.940
we

32:05.940 --> 32:06.940
say

32:06.940 --> 32:07.940
it is

32:07.940 --> 32:08.940
an ecosystem.

32:08.940 --> 32:09.940
In terms

32:09.940 --> 32:10.940
of geosystem

32:10.940 --> 32:11.940
research,

32:11.940 --> 32:12.940
we will

32:12.940 --> 32:13.940
find that

32:13.940 --> 32:14.940
geosystem

32:14.940 --> 32:15.940
research

32:15.940 --> 32:16.940
also has

32:16.940 --> 32:17.940
different

32:17.940 --> 32:18.940
areas,

32:18.940 --> 32:19.940
just like

32:19.940 --> 32:20.940
other

32:20.940 --> 32:21.940
research.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.940
For

32:22.940 --> 32:23.940
example,

32:23.940 --> 32:24.940
I call it

32:24.940 --> 32:25.940
life cycle

32:25.940 --> 32:26.940
here,

32:26.940 --> 32:27.940
because

32:27.940 --> 32:28.940
I found

32:28.940 --> 32:29.940
that this

32:29.940 --> 32:30.940
is actually

32:30.940 --> 32:31.940
related to

32:31.940 --> 32:32.940
time.

32:32.940 --> 32:33.940
So

32:33.940 --> 32:34.940
if you

32:34.940 --> 32:35.940
are

32:35.940 --> 32:36.940
doing

32:36.940 --> 32:37.940
geosystem

32:37.940 --> 32:38.940
research,

32:38.940 --> 32:39.940
you

32:39.940 --> 32:40.940
need to

32:40.940 --> 32:41.940
collect

32:41.940 --> 32:42.940
a lot of

32:42.940 --> 32:43.940
data.

32:43.940 --> 32:44.940
Whether

32:44.940 --> 32:45.940
you are

32:45.940 --> 32:46.940
going out

32:46.940 --> 32:47.940
to collect

32:47.940 --> 32:48.940
data or

32:48.940 --> 32:49.940
you are

32:49.940 --> 32:50.940
directly

32:50.940 --> 32:51.940
collecting

32:51.940 --> 32:52.940
data on

32:52.940 --> 32:53.940
the Internet

32:53.940 --> 32:54.940
to see

32:54.940 --> 32:55.940
if there

32:55.940 --> 32:56.940
is

32:56.940 --> 32:57.940
any

32:57.940 --> 32:58.940
data

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
that

32:59.940 --> 33:00.940
is better

33:00.940 --> 33:01.940
than

33:01.940 --> 33:02.940
what

33:02.940 --> 33:03.940
you

33:03.940 --> 33:04.940
are

33:04.940 --> 33:05.940
collecting.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.940
So

33:06.940 --> 33:07.940
you

33:07.940 --> 33:08.940
need to

33:08.940 --> 33:09.940
collect

33:09.940 --> 33:10.940
a lot

33:10.940 --> 33:11.940
of

33:11.940 --> 33:12.940
data

33:12.940 --> 33:13.940
and

33:13.940 --> 33:14.940
collect

33:14.940 --> 33:15.940
a lot

33:15.940 --> 33:16.940
of

33:16.940 --> 33:17.940
data

33:17.940 --> 33:18.940
and

33:18.940 --> 33:19.940
collect

33:19.940 --> 33:20.940
a lot

33:20.940 --> 33:21.940
of

33:21.940 --> 33:22.940
data

33:22.940 --> 33:23.940
and

33:23.940 --> 33:24.940
collect

33:24.940 --> 33:25.940
a lot

33:25.940 --> 33:26.940
of

33:26.940 --> 33:27.940
data

33:27.940 --> 33:28.940
and

33:28.940 --> 33:29.940
collect

33:29.940 --> 33:30.940
a lot

33:30.940 --> 33:31.940
of

33:31.940 --> 33:32.940
data

33:32.940 --> 33:33.940
and

33:33.940 --> 33:34.940
collect

33:34.940 --> 33:35.940
a lot

33:35.940 --> 33:36.940
of

33:36.940 --> 33:37.940
data

33:37.940 --> 33:38.940
and

33:38.940 --> 33:39.940
collect

33:39.940 --> 33:40.940
a lot

33:40.940 --> 33:41.940
of

33:41.940 --> 33:42.940
data

33:42.940 --> 33:43.940
and

33:43.940 --> 33:44.940
collect

33:44.940 --> 33:45.940
a lot

33:45.940 --> 33:46.940
of

33:46.940 --> 33:47.940
data

33:47.940 --> 33:48.940
and

33:48.940 --> 33:49.940
solve

33:49.940 --> 33:50.940
a lot

33:50.940 --> 33:51.940
of

33:51.940 --> 33:52.940
problems

33:52.940 --> 33:53.940
that

33:53.940 --> 33:54.940
other

33:54.940 --> 33:55.940
people

33:55.940 --> 33:56.940
might

33:56.940 --> 33:57.940
have

33:57.940 --> 33:58.940
to solve.

33:58.940 --> 33:59.940
And

33:59.940 --> 34:00.940
If you

34:00.940 --> 34:01.940
want to

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
publish

34:02.940 --> 34:03.940
your

34:03.940 --> 34:04.940
research,

34:04.940 --> 34:05.940
you might

34:05.940 --> 34:06.940
want to

34:06.940 --> 34:07.940
use

34:07.940 --> 34:08.940
Finder or

34:08.940 --> 34:09.940
Jupyter NB Viewer

34:09.940 --> 34:10.940
so that

34:10.940 --> 34:11.940
other people

34:11.940 --> 34:12.940
can see

34:12.940 --> 34:13.940
your

34:13.940 --> 34:14.940
notebook.

34:14.940 --> 34:15.940
And

34:15.940 --> 34:16.940
lastly,

34:16.940 --> 34:17.940
if you

34:17.940 --> 34:18.940
need to

34:18.940 --> 34:19.940
teach,

34:19.940 --> 34:20.940
you might

34:20.940 --> 34:21.940
want to

34:21.940 --> 34:22.940
use

34:22.940 --> 34:23.940
JupyterHub

34:23.940 --> 34:24.940
so that

34:24.940 --> 34:25.940
students

34:25.940 --> 34:26.940
don't

34:26.940 --> 34:27.940
have to

34:27.940 --> 34:28.940
provide

34:28.940 --> 34:29.940
their

34:29.940 --> 34:30.940
notebook

34:30.940 --> 34:31.940
and

34:31.940 --> 34:32.940
it can

34:32.940 --> 34:33.940
be used

34:33.940 --> 34:34.940
for

34:34.940 --> 34:35.940
teaching.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.940
So

34:36.940 --> 34:37.940
we see

34:37.940 --> 34:38.940
geological

34:38.940 --> 34:39.940
research

34:39.940 --> 34:40.940
is

34:40.940 --> 34:41.940
actually

34:41.940 --> 34:42.940
a very

34:42.940 --> 34:43.940
interesting

34:43.940 --> 34:44.940
field.

34:44.940 --> 34:45.940
So

34:45.940 --> 34:46.940
we

34:46.940 --> 34:47.940
thought

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
that

34:48.940 --> 34:49.940
we

34:49.940 --> 34:50.940
can

34:50.940 --> 34:51.940
promote

34:51.940 --> 34:52.940
our

34:52.940 --> 34:53.940
Jupyter

34:53.940 --> 34:54.940
Ecology

34:54.940 --> 34:55.940
so that

34:55.940 --> 34:56.940
it can

34:56.940 --> 34:57.940
be used

34:57.940 --> 34:58.940
by

34:58.940 --> 34:59.940
future

34:59.940 --> 35:00.940
generations

35:00.940 --> 35:01.940
for

35:01.940 --> 35:02.940
geological

35:02.940 --> 35:03.940
research.

35:03.940 --> 35:04.940
On the

35:04.940 --> 35:05.940
other hand,

35:05.940 --> 35:06.940
we can

35:06.940 --> 35:07.940
get feedback

35:07.940 --> 35:08.940
from

35:08.940 --> 35:09.940
geological

35:09.940 --> 35:10.940
researchers.

35:10.940 --> 35:11.940
For

35:11.940 --> 35:12.940
example,

35:12.940 --> 35:13.940
if they

35:13.940 --> 35:14.940
think

35:14.940 --> 35:15.940
this

35:15.940 --> 35:16.940
tool

35:16.940 --> 35:17.940
is good

35:17.940 --> 35:18.940
or

35:18.940 --> 35:19.940
hard to

35:19.940 --> 35:20.940
use,

35:20.940 --> 35:21.940
they

35:21.940 --> 35:22.940
can

35:22.940 --> 35:23.940
let

35:23.940 --> 35:24.940
the

35:24.940 --> 35:25.940
development

35:25.940 --> 35:26.940
team

35:26.940 --> 35:27.940
know

35:27.940 --> 35:28.940
that

35:28.940 --> 35:29.940
this

35:29.940 --> 35:30.940
tool

35:30.940 --> 35:31.940
can

35:31.940 --> 35:32.940
be used

35:32.940 --> 35:33.940
by

35:33.940 --> 35:34.940
future

35:34.940 --> 35:35.940
generations.

35:35.940 --> 35:36.940
So

35:36.940 --> 35:37.940
we

35:37.940 --> 35:38.940
started

35:38.940 --> 35:39.940
this

35:39.940 --> 35:40.940
Jupyter

35:40.940 --> 35:41.940
Meteors

35:41.940 --> 35:42.940
project.

35:42.940 --> 35:43.940
I

35:43.940 --> 35:44.940
joined

35:44.940 --> 35:45.940
this

35:45.940 --> 35:46.940
project

35:46.940 --> 35:47.940
last

35:47.940 --> 35:48.940
year.

35:48.940 --> 35:49.940
You

35:49.940 --> 35:50.940
can

35:50.940 --> 35:51.940
see

35:51.940 --> 35:52.940
the

35:52.940 --> 35:53.940
people

35:53.940 --> 35:54.940
in this

35:54.940 --> 35:55.940
project

35:55.940 --> 35:56.940
are

35:56.940 --> 35:57.940
scientists

35:57.940 --> 35:58.940
and

35:58.940 --> 35:59.940
physicists.

35:59.940 --> 36:00.940
They

36:00.940 --> 36:01.940
have

36:01.940 --> 36:02.940
different

36:02.940 --> 36:03.940
perspectives.

36:03.940 --> 36:04.940
Some

36:04.940 --> 36:05.940
are

36:05.940 --> 36:06.940
scientists

36:06.940 --> 36:07.940
and

36:07.940 --> 36:08.940
physicists.

36:08.940 --> 36:09.940
Specifically,

36:09.940 --> 36:10.940
we

36:10.940 --> 36:11.940
want to

36:11.940 --> 36:12.940
provide

36:12.940 --> 36:13.940
some

36:13.940 --> 36:14.940
practical

36:14.940 --> 36:15.940
examples

36:15.940 --> 36:16.940
for

36:16.940 --> 36:17.940
geological

36:17.940 --> 36:18.940
research.

36:18.940 --> 36:19.940
We

36:19.940 --> 36:20.940
want to

36:20.940 --> 36:21.940
use

36:21.940 --> 36:22.940
these

36:22.940 --> 36:23.940
examples

36:23.940 --> 36:24.940
to

36:24.940 --> 36:25.940
make

36:25.940 --> 36:26.940
geological

36:26.940 --> 36:27.940
research

36:27.940 --> 36:28.940
as

36:28.940 --> 36:29.940
efficient as

36:29.940 --> 36:30.940
possible.

36:30.940 --> 36:31.940
We

36:31.940 --> 36:32.940
want to

36:32.940 --> 36:33.940
use these

36:33.940 --> 36:34.940
examples

36:34.940 --> 36:35.940
to

36:35.940 --> 36:36.940
see

36:36.940 --> 36:37.940
what

36:37.940 --> 36:38.940
we can

36:38.940 --> 36:39.940
do

36:39.940 --> 36:40.940
to

36:40.940 --> 36:41.940
develop

36:41.940 --> 36:42.940
Jupyter

36:42.940 --> 36:43.940
in the

36:43.940 --> 36:44.940
future.

36:44.940 --> 36:45.940
There

36:45.940 --> 36:46.940
are

36:46.940 --> 36:47.940
at

36:47.940 --> 36:48.940
least

36:48.940 --> 36:49.940
two or

36:49.940 --> 36:50.940
three

36:50.940 --> 36:51.940
examples

36:51.940 --> 36:52.940
on

36:52.940 --> 36:53.940
Jupyter

36:53.940 --> 36:54.940
that

36:54.940 --> 36:55.940
I

36:55.940 --> 36:56.940
published

36:56.940 --> 36:57.940
at

36:57.940 --> 36:58.940
the

36:58.940 --> 36:59.940
AGU

36:59.940 --> 37:00.940
conference

37:00.940 --> 37:01.940
last

37:01.940 --> 37:02.940
year.

37:02.940 --> 37:03.940
These

37:03.940 --> 37:04.940
are

37:04.940 --> 37:05.940
my,

37:05.940 --> 37:06.940
Shashank

37:06.940 --> 37:07.940
Bhushan,

37:07.940 --> 37:08.940
Max

37:08.940 --> 37:09.940
Van

37:09.940 --> 37:10.940
Wick

37:10.940 --> 37:11.940
DeVry,

37:11.940 --> 37:12.940
Will

37:12.940 --> 37:13.940
Kotitsky,

37:13.940 --> 37:14.940
and

37:14.940 --> 37:15.940
David

37:15.940 --> 37:16.940
Hsien's

37:16.940 --> 37:17.940
research

37:17.940 --> 37:18.940
projects.

37:18.940 --> 37:19.940
I

37:19.940 --> 37:20.940
won't

37:20.940 --> 37:21.940
go into

37:21.940 --> 37:22.940
the

37:22.940 --> 37:23.940
details

37:23.940 --> 37:24.940
here,

37:24.940 --> 37:25.940
but

37:25.940 --> 37:26.940
the

37:26.940 --> 37:27.940
key

37:27.940 --> 37:28.940
point

37:28.940 --> 37:29.940
is that

37:29.940 --> 37:30.940
this

37:30.940 --> 37:31.940
poster

37:31.940 --> 37:32.940
was

37:32.940 --> 37:33.940
released

37:33.940 --> 37:34.940
publicly

37:34.940 --> 37:35.940
on

37:35.940 --> 37:36.940
the

37:36.940 --> 37:37.940
ESSOAR

37:37.940 --> 37:38.940
archive,

37:38.940 --> 37:39.940
so

37:39.940 --> 37:40.940
you can

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
check it

37:41.940 --> 37:42.940
out

37:42.940 --> 37:43.940
at

37:43.940 --> 37:44.940
any time

37:44.940 --> 37:45.940
through

37:45.940 --> 37:46.940
this

37:46.940 --> 37:47.940
link.

37:47.940 --> 37:48.940
But

37:48.940 --> 37:49.940
you can

37:49.940 --> 37:50.940
see

37:50.940 --> 37:51.940
the

37:51.940 --> 37:52.940
QR

37:52.940 --> 37:53.940
code

37:53.940 --> 37:54.940
on

37:54.940 --> 37:55.940
the

37:55.940 --> 37:56.940
next

37:56.940 --> 37:57.940
page.

37:57.940 --> 37:58.940
This

37:58.940 --> 37:59.940
is the

37:59.940 --> 38:00.940
page I

38:00.940 --> 38:01.940
want to

38:01.940 --> 38:02.940
show you

38:02.940 --> 38:03.940
today.

38:03.940 --> 38:04.940
This

38:04.940 --> 38:05.940
is

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
the

38:06.940 --> 38:07.940
page.

38:07.940 --> 38:08.940
You

38:08.940 --> 38:09.940
can see

38:09.940 --> 38:10.940
that

38:10.940 --> 38:11.940
this is

38:11.940 --> 38:12.940
actually

38:12.940 --> 38:13.940
a

38:13.940 --> 38:14.940
page

38:14.940 --> 38:15.940
built

38:15.940 --> 38:16.940
on

38:16.940 --> 38:17.940
GitHub.

38:17.940 --> 38:18.940
It

38:18.940 --> 38:19.940
looks like

38:19.940 --> 38:20.940
a document

38:20.940 --> 38:21.940
that

38:21.940 --> 38:22.940
I

38:22.940 --> 38:23.940
wrote.

38:23.940 --> 38:24.940
It

38:24.940 --> 38:25.940
is actually

38:25.940 --> 38:26.940
a

38:26.940 --> 38:27.940
compilation of

38:27.940 --> 38:28.940
many

38:28.940 --> 38:29.940
different

38:29.940 --> 38:30.940
notebooks,

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
which means

38:31.940 --> 38:32.940
that

38:32.940 --> 38:33.940
every page

38:33.940 --> 38:34.940
you click

38:34.940 --> 38:35.940
here is

38:35.940 --> 38:36.940
actually

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
originally

38:37.940 --> 38:38.940
a

38:38.940 --> 38:39.940
notebook.

38:39.940 --> 38:40.940
You

38:40.940 --> 38:41.940
can see

38:41.940 --> 38:42.940
that

38:42.940 --> 38:43.940
it has

38:43.940 --> 38:44.940
a lot of

38:44.940 --> 38:45.940
content

38:45.940 --> 38:46.940
telling

38:46.940 --> 38:47.940
you how

38:47.940 --> 38:48.940
to get

38:48.940 --> 38:49.940
the

38:49.940 --> 38:50.940
content

38:50.940 --> 38:51.940
you

38:51.940 --> 38:52.940
want.

38:52.940 --> 38:53.940
Jupyter

38:53.940 --> 38:54.940
Book has

38:54.940 --> 38:55.940
a button

38:55.940 --> 38:56.940
called

38:56.940 --> 38:57.940
finder

38:57.940 --> 38:58.940
in the

38:58.940 --> 38:59.940
upper right

38:59.940 --> 39:00.940
corner.

39:00.940 --> 39:01.940
You

39:01.940 --> 39:02.940
can

39:02.940 --> 39:03.940
turn

39:03.940 --> 39:04.940
this

39:04.940 --> 39:05.940
GitHub

39:05.940 --> 39:06.940
page

39:06.940 --> 39:07.940
into

39:07.940 --> 39:08.940
a

39:08.940 --> 39:09.940
page

39:09.940 --> 39:10.940
where

39:10.940 --> 39:11.940
you

39:11.940 --> 39:12.940
can

39:12.940 --> 39:13.940
run

39:13.940 --> 39:14.940
code

39:14.940 --> 39:15.940
directly.

39:15.940 --> 39:16.940
But

39:16.940 --> 39:17.940
it

39:17.940 --> 39:18.940
takes

39:18.940 --> 39:19.940
a

39:19.940 --> 39:20.940
long

39:20.940 --> 39:21.940
time.

39:21.940 --> 39:22.940
Let's

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
take a

39:23.940 --> 39:24.940
look.

39:24.940 --> 39:25.940
You

39:25.940 --> 39:26.940
can

39:26.940 --> 39:27.940
imagine

39:27.940 --> 39:28.940
that

39:28.940 --> 39:29.940
when

39:29.940 --> 39:30.940
I

39:30.940 --> 39:31.940
was

39:31.940 --> 39:32.940
reporting

39:32.940 --> 39:33.940
this

39:33.940 --> 39:34.940
poster

39:34.940 --> 39:35.940
at the

39:35.940 --> 39:36.940
AGU

39:36.940 --> 39:37.940
conference,

39:37.940 --> 39:38.940
I

39:38.940 --> 39:39.940
could

39:39.940 --> 39:40.940
tell

39:40.940 --> 39:41.940
most

39:41.940 --> 39:42.940
of the

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
audience

39:43.940 --> 39:44.940
about

39:44.940 --> 39:45.940
Jupyter

39:45.940 --> 39:46.940
Book.

39:46.940 --> 39:47.940
But

39:47.940 --> 39:48.940
when I

39:48.940 --> 39:49.940
was

39:49.940 --> 39:50.940
reporting

39:50.940 --> 39:51.940
this

39:51.940 --> 39:52.940
poster

39:52.940 --> 39:53.940
at the

39:53.940 --> 39:54.940
AGU

39:54.940 --> 39:55.940
conference,

39:55.940 --> 39:56.940
I

39:56.940 --> 39:57.940
could

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
use

39:58.940 --> 39:59.940
the

39:59.940 --> 40:00.940
QR code

40:00.940 --> 40:01.940
or

40:01.940 --> 40:02.940
my

40:02.940 --> 40:03.940
laptop

40:03.940 --> 40:04.940
to

40:04.940 --> 40:05.940
show

40:05.940 --> 40:06.940
them

40:06.940 --> 40:07.940
the

40:07.940 --> 40:08.940
details

40:08.940 --> 40:09.940
of the

40:09.940 --> 40:10.940
code

40:10.940 --> 40:11.940
and

40:11.940 --> 40:12.940
show

40:12.940 --> 40:13.940
them

40:13.940 --> 40:14.940
the

40:14.940 --> 40:15.940
details

40:15.940 --> 40:16.940
of the

40:16.940 --> 40:17.940
code.

40:17.940 --> 40:18.940
So

40:18.940 --> 40:19.940
you

40:19.940 --> 40:20.940
can

40:20.940 --> 40:21.940
run

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
the

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
final

40:23.940 --> 40:24.940
code

40:24.940 --> 40:25.940
again.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
You

40:26.940 --> 40:27.940
can

40:27.940 --> 40:28.940
change

40:28.940 --> 40:29.940
the

40:29.940 --> 40:30.940
content

40:30.940 --> 40:31.940
like

40:31.940 --> 40:32.940
blah blah

40:32.940 --> 40:33.940
blah.

40:33.940 --> 40:34.940
You

40:34.940 --> 40:35.940
can

40:35.940 --> 40:36.940
change

40:36.940 --> 40:37.940
the

40:37.940 --> 40:38.940
content

40:38.940 --> 40:39.940
directly.

40:39.940 --> 40:40.940
That's

40:40.940 --> 40:41.940
about it.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.940
Let's

40:42.940 --> 40:43.940
go back

40:43.940 --> 40:44.940
to the

40:44.940 --> 40:45.940
video.

40:45.940 --> 40:46.940
Now

40:46.940 --> 40:47.940
we can

40:47.940 --> 40:48.940
have a deeper

40:48.940 --> 40:49.940
and more

40:49.940 --> 40:50.940
efficient

40:50.940 --> 40:51.940
academic

40:51.940 --> 40:52.940
exchange.

40:52.940 --> 40:53.940
Here's another

40:53.940 --> 40:54.940
example, but

40:54.940 --> 40:55.940
I'm not going

40:55.940 --> 40:56.940
to show

40:56.940 --> 40:57.940
too many

40:57.940 --> 40:58.940
examples.

40:58.940 --> 40:59.940
This

40:59.940 --> 41:00.940
example is

41:00.940 --> 41:01.940
an article

41:01.940 --> 41:02.940
I

41:02.940 --> 41:03.940
submitted

41:03.940 --> 41:04.940
last year.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.940
It's still

41:05.940 --> 41:06.940
in the

41:06.940 --> 41:07.940
draft.

41:07.940 --> 41:08.940
The

41:08.940 --> 41:09.940
screen

41:09.940 --> 41:10.940
you see

41:10.940 --> 41:11.940
now is

41:11.940 --> 41:12.940
actually

41:12.940 --> 41:13.940
GitHub's

41:13.940 --> 41:14.940
page.

41:14.940 --> 41:15.940
The

41:15.940 --> 41:16.940
supplementary

41:16.940 --> 41:17.940
material.

41:17.940 --> 41:18.940
All of

41:18.940 --> 41:19.940
this article's

41:19.940 --> 41:20.940
supplementary

41:20.940 --> 41:21.940
material is

41:21.940 --> 41:22.940
actually on

41:22.940 --> 41:23.940
GitHub.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.940
And

41:24.940 --> 41:25.940
it's

41:25.940 --> 41:26.940
compiled

41:26.940 --> 41:27.940
in the

41:27.940 --> 41:28.940
Driftbook

41:28.940 --> 41:29.940
format.

41:29.940 --> 41:30.940
So

41:30.940 --> 41:31.940
you can

41:31.940 --> 41:32.940
see

41:32.940 --> 41:33.940
like

41:33.940 --> 41:34.940
this

41:34.940 --> 41:35.940
page

41:35.940 --> 41:36.940
is

41:36.940 --> 41:37.940
saying

41:37.940 --> 41:38.940
if

41:38.940 --> 41:39.940
you want

41:39.940 --> 41:40.940
to

41:40.940 --> 41:41.940
reproduce

41:41.940 --> 41:42.940
this

41:42.940 --> 41:43.940
article's

41:43.940 --> 41:44.940
material,

41:44.940 --> 41:45.940
you can

41:45.940 --> 41:46.940
just

41:46.940 --> 41:47.940
execute

41:47.940 --> 41:48.940
it and

41:48.940 --> 41:49.940
it will

41:49.940 --> 41:50.940
take the

41:50.940 --> 41:51.940
material you

41:51.940 --> 41:52.940
want to

41:52.940 --> 41:53.940
draw

41:53.940 --> 41:54.940
from the

41:54.940 --> 41:55.940
supplementary

41:55.940 --> 41:56.940
material

41:56.940 --> 41:57.940
from

41:57.940 --> 41:58.940
other

41:58.940 --> 41:59.940
articles.

41:59.940 --> 42:00.940
In other

42:00.940 --> 42:01.940
words,

42:01.940 --> 42:02.940
when we

42:02.940 --> 42:03.940
use these

42:03.940 --> 42:04.940
tools

42:04.940 --> 42:05.940
to publish

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
articles in

42:06.940 --> 42:07.940
the future,

42:07.940 --> 42:08.940
the

42:08.940 --> 42:09.940
process,

42:09.940 --> 42:10.940
the

42:10.940 --> 42:11.940
format,

42:11.940 --> 42:12.940
and

42:12.940 --> 42:13.940
the

42:13.940 --> 42:14.940
material

42:14.940 --> 42:15.940
will

42:15.940 --> 42:16.940
be

42:16.940 --> 42:17.940
connected

42:17.940 --> 42:18.940
to your

42:18.940 --> 42:19.940
article,

42:19.940 --> 42:20.940
so they

42:20.940 --> 42:21.940
will

42:21.940 --> 42:22.940
have a

42:22.940 --> 42:23.940
DOI.

42:23.940 --> 42:24.940
In other

42:24.940 --> 42:25.940
words,

42:25.940 --> 42:26.940
the

42:26.940 --> 42:27.940
materials you

42:27.940 --> 42:28.940
publish

42:28.940 --> 42:29.940
will not

42:29.940 --> 42:30.940
disappear

42:30.940 --> 42:31.940
in the

42:31.940 --> 42:32.940
vast

42:32.940 --> 42:33.940
ocean

42:33.940 --> 42:34.940
of the

42:34.940 --> 42:35.940
Internet

42:35.940 --> 42:36.940
as

42:36.940 --> 42:37.940
time

42:37.940 --> 42:38.940
goes by.

42:38.940 --> 42:39.940
Okay,

42:39.940 --> 42:40.940
so

42:40.940 --> 42:41.940
my main

42:41.940 --> 42:42.940
question

42:42.940 --> 42:43.940
is,

42:43.940 --> 42:44.940
what does

42:44.940 --> 42:45.940
a DOI

42:45.940 --> 42:46.940
mean?

42:46.940 --> 42:47.940
I actually

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
don't know

42:48.940 --> 42:49.940
what DOI

42:49.940 --> 42:50.940
is.

42:50.940 --> 42:51.940
Okay,

42:51.940 --> 42:52.940
thank you for

42:52.940 --> 42:53.940
asking.

42:53.940 --> 42:54.940
DOI

42:54.940 --> 42:55.940
stands for

42:55.940 --> 42:56.940
digital

42:56.940 --> 42:57.940
identification.

42:57.940 --> 42:58.940
You

42:58.940 --> 42:59.940
can

42:59.940 --> 43:00.940
imagine it

43:00.940 --> 43:01.940
as

43:01.940 --> 43:02.940
something like

43:02.940 --> 43:03.940
the concept

43:03.940 --> 43:04.940
of

43:04.940 --> 43:05.940
a

43:05.940 --> 43:06.940
lock number.

43:06.940 --> 43:07.940
However,

43:07.940 --> 43:08.940
in the

43:08.940 --> 43:09.940
Internet

43:09.940 --> 43:10.940
world,

43:10.940 --> 43:11.940
for example,

43:11.940 --> 43:12.940
you may have to change

43:12.940 --> 43:13.940
your website

43:13.940 --> 43:14.940
due to

43:14.940 --> 43:15.940
funding or

43:15.940 --> 43:16.940
other factors.

43:16.940 --> 43:17.940
Even publishers

43:17.940 --> 43:18.940
may change

43:18.940 --> 43:19.940
their website

43:19.940 --> 43:20.940
from time to

43:20.940 --> 43:21.940
time,

43:21.940 --> 43:22.940
so if

43:22.940 --> 43:23.940
you save

43:23.940 --> 43:24.940
an article

43:24.940 --> 43:25.940
in the

43:25.940 --> 43:26.940
website,

43:26.940 --> 43:27.940
you

43:27.940 --> 43:28.940
may be

43:28.940 --> 43:29.940
able to

43:29.940 --> 43:30.940
do it

43:30.940 --> 43:31.940
this year

43:31.940 --> 43:32.940
or next

43:32.940 --> 43:33.940
year,

43:33.940 --> 43:34.940
but

43:34.940 --> 43:35.940
it

43:35.940 --> 43:36.940
may

43:36.940 --> 43:37.940
fail

43:37.940 --> 43:38.940
ten years

43:38.940 --> 43:39.940
later.

43:39.940 --> 43:40.940
The

43:40.940 --> 43:41.940
identification code

43:41.940 --> 43:42.940
will not

43:42.940 --> 43:43.940
change

43:43.940 --> 43:44.940
according to

43:44.940 --> 43:45.940
the

43:45.940 --> 43:46.940
publisher's

43:46.940 --> 43:47.940
website.

43:47.940 --> 43:48.940
In other

43:48.940 --> 43:49.940
words,

43:49.940 --> 43:50.940
if you

43:50.940 --> 43:51.940
register a

43:51.940 --> 43:52.940
set of

43:52.940 --> 43:53.940
DOI

43:53.940 --> 43:54.940
today,

43:54.940 --> 43:55.940
the identification

43:55.940 --> 43:56.940
code,

43:56.940 --> 43:57.940
that is,

43:57.940 --> 43:58.940
this

43:58.940 --> 43:59.940
DOI.org

43:59.940 --> 44:00.940
and

44:00.940 --> 44:01.940
10.5194

44:01.940 --> 44:02.940
will not

44:02.940 --> 44:03.940
change

44:03.940 --> 44:04.940
according to

44:04.940 --> 44:05.940
the publisher's

44:05.940 --> 44:06.940
website.

44:06.940 --> 44:07.940
You

44:07.940 --> 44:08.940
can connect

44:08.940 --> 44:09.940
your

44:09.940 --> 44:10.940
identification

44:10.940 --> 44:11.940
code to

44:11.940 --> 44:12.940
the

44:12.940 --> 44:13.940
DOI

44:13.940 --> 44:14.940
website

44:14.940 --> 44:15.940
and

44:15.940 --> 44:16.940
it will

44:16.940 --> 44:17.940
be

44:17.940 --> 44:18.940
the

44:18.940 --> 44:19.940
actual

44:19.940 --> 44:20.940
location

44:20.940 --> 44:21.940
and

44:21.940 --> 44:22.940
the

44:22.940 --> 44:23.940
latest

44:23.940 --> 44:24.940
version.

44:24.940 --> 44:25.940
The

44:25.940 --> 44:26.940
next

44:26.940 --> 44:27.940
question is

44:27.940 --> 44:28.940
why

44:28.940 --> 44:29.940
can you

44:29.940 --> 44:30.940
put your

44:30.940 --> 44:31.940
code on

44:31.940 --> 44:32.940
the DOI

44:32.940 --> 44:33.940
?

44:33.940 --> 44:34.940
This

44:34.940 --> 44:35.940
is a

44:35.940 --> 44:36.940
certain

44:36.940 --> 44:37.940
condition.

44:37.940 --> 44:38.940
Publishers,

44:38.940 --> 44:39.940
the

44:39.940 --> 44:40.940
publishers of

44:40.940 --> 44:41.940
academic journals

44:41.940 --> 44:42.940
have basically

44:42.940 --> 44:43.940
done this

44:43.940 --> 44:44.940
thing.

44:44.940 --> 44:45.940
For

44:45.940 --> 44:46.940
city code

44:46.940 --> 44:47.940
or

44:47.940 --> 44:48.940
information,

44:48.940 --> 44:49.940
the

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
service I

44:50.940 --> 44:51.940
am using

44:51.940 --> 44:52.940
now is

44:52.940 --> 44:53.940
called

44:53.940 --> 44:54.940
Zenodo.

44:54.940 --> 44:55.940
Zenodo

44:55.940 --> 44:56.940
is

44:56.940 --> 44:57.940
that

44:57.940 --> 44:58.940
CERN,

44:58.940 --> 44:59.940
that is,

44:59.940 --> 45:00.940
the

45:00.940 --> 45:01.940
European

45:01.940 --> 45:02.940
lead

45:02.940 --> 45:03.940
counter.

45:03.940 --> 45:04.940
They

45:04.940 --> 45:05.940
have a

45:05.940 --> 45:06.940
lot of

45:06.940 --> 45:07.940
information

45:07.940 --> 45:08.940
and

45:08.940 --> 45:09.940
they can

45:09.940 --> 45:10.940
upload

45:10.940 --> 45:11.940
their

45:11.940 --> 45:12.940
information

45:12.940 --> 45:13.940
and

45:13.940 --> 45:14.940
city code

45:14.940 --> 45:15.940
to their

45:15.940 --> 45:16.940
server.

45:16.940 --> 45:17.940
Then

45:17.940 --> 45:18.940
when you

45:18.940 --> 45:19.940
upload everything

45:19.940 --> 45:20.940
and

45:20.940 --> 45:21.940
get all

45:21.940 --> 45:22.940
the

45:22.940 --> 45:23.940
background

45:23.940 --> 45:24.940
information

45:24.940 --> 45:25.940
right,

45:25.940 --> 45:26.940
they

45:26.940 --> 45:27.940
will

45:27.940 --> 45:28.940
register

45:28.940 --> 45:29.940
a

45:29.940 --> 45:30.940
DOI

45:30.940 --> 45:31.940
for you

45:31.940 --> 45:32.940
as

45:32.940 --> 45:33.940
the

45:33.940 --> 45:34.940
version of

45:34.940 --> 45:35.940
the

45:35.940 --> 45:36.940
DOI.

45:36.940 --> 45:37.940
There are

45:37.940 --> 45:38.940
two places.

45:38.940 --> 45:39.940
One is

45:39.940 --> 45:40.940
Zenodo

45:40.940 --> 45:41.940
that I

45:41.940 --> 45:42.940
just

45:42.940 --> 45:43.940
said

45:43.940 --> 45:44.940
is provided by

45:44.940 --> 45:45.940
CERN.

45:45.940 --> 45:46.940
The

45:46.940 --> 45:47.940
other one

45:47.940 --> 45:48.940
is also

45:48.940 --> 45:49.940
done by

45:49.940 --> 45:50.940
the

45:50.940 --> 45:51.940
Europeans

45:51.940 --> 45:52.940
called

45:52.940 --> 45:53.940
Pangea,

45:53.940 --> 45:54.940
but

45:54.940 --> 45:55.940
its

45:55.940 --> 45:56.940
content

45:56.940 --> 45:57.940
is the

45:57.940 --> 45:58.940
same as

45:58.940 --> 45:59.940
this,

45:59.940 --> 46:00.940
but

46:00.940 --> 46:01.940
there are

46:01.940 --> 46:02.940
different

46:02.940 --> 46:03.940
services

46:03.940 --> 46:04.940
provided

46:04.940 --> 46:05.940
by

46:05.940 --> 46:06.940
Pangea.

46:06.940 --> 46:07.940
Let me

46:07.940 --> 46:08.940
briefly

46:08.940 --> 46:09.940
explain

46:09.940 --> 46:10.940
that.

46:10.940 --> 46:11.940
What we

46:11.940 --> 46:12.940
talked about

46:12.940 --> 46:13.940
before was

46:13.940 --> 46:14.940
the main

46:14.940 --> 46:15.940
purpose of

46:15.940 --> 46:16.940
Jupyter

46:16.940 --> 46:17.940
Meteor

46:17.940 --> 46:18.940
and

46:18.940 --> 46:19.940
what we

46:19.940 --> 46:20.940
have done

46:20.940 --> 46:21.940
so far.

46:21.940 --> 46:22.940
Next,

46:22.940 --> 46:23.940
I want to

46:23.940 --> 46:24.940
talk a little

46:24.940 --> 46:25.940
about

46:25.940 --> 46:26.940
what we

46:26.940 --> 46:27.940
are going

46:27.940 --> 46:28.940
to do in

46:28.940 --> 46:29.940
the future

46:29.940 --> 46:30.940
and

46:30.940 --> 46:31.940
what happened

46:31.940 --> 46:32.940
in the

46:32.940 --> 46:33.940
community.

46:33.940 --> 46:34.940
The

46:34.940 --> 46:35.940
community

46:35.940 --> 46:36.940
has

46:36.940 --> 46:37.940
some

46:37.940 --> 46:38.940
geek

46:38.940 --> 46:39.940
enthusiasts.

46:39.940 --> 46:40.940
They

46:40.940 --> 46:41.940
are using

46:41.940 --> 46:42.940
Jupyter

46:42.940 --> 46:43.940
and

46:43.940 --> 46:44.940
Dask

46:44.940 --> 46:45.940
for

46:45.940 --> 46:46.940
parallel

46:46.940 --> 46:47.940
computing.

46:47.940 --> 46:48.940
They

46:48.940 --> 46:49.940
are also

46:49.940 --> 46:50.940
using

46:50.940 --> 46:51.940
X-Array

46:51.940 --> 46:52.940
to

46:52.940 --> 46:53.940
process

46:53.940 --> 46:54.940
their

46:54.940 --> 46:55.940
data.

46:55.940 --> 46:56.940
We

46:56.940 --> 46:57.940
have a

46:57.940 --> 46:58.940
close

46:58.940 --> 46:59.940
relationship

46:59.940 --> 47:00.940
with

47:00.940 --> 47:01.940
the

47:01.940 --> 47:02.940
community

47:02.940 --> 47:03.940
and

47:03.940 --> 47:04.940
they are

47:04.940 --> 47:05.940
actively

47:05.940 --> 47:06.940
promoting

47:06.940 --> 47:07.940
using these

47:07.940 --> 47:08.940
three

47:08.940 --> 47:09.940
to do

47:09.940 --> 47:10.940
Earth

47:10.940 --> 47:11.940
research.

47:11.940 --> 47:12.940
They

47:12.940 --> 47:13.940
are also

47:13.940 --> 47:14.940
making

47:14.940 --> 47:15.940
a lot

47:15.940 --> 47:16.940
of

47:16.940 --> 47:17.940
use of

47:17.940 --> 47:18.940
them.

47:18.940 --> 47:19.940
For

47:19.940 --> 47:20.940
example,

47:20.940 --> 47:21.940
Scott

47:21.940 --> 47:22.940
Henderson

47:22.940 --> 47:23.940
from

47:23.940 --> 47:24.940
the

47:24.940 --> 47:25.940
University

47:25.940 --> 47:26.940
of

47:26.940 --> 47:27.940
Washington

47:27.940 --> 47:28.940
published

47:28.940 --> 47:29.940
a

47:29.940 --> 47:30.940
paper

47:30.940 --> 47:31.940
on how

47:31.940 --> 47:32.940
to

47:32.940 --> 47:33.940
use

47:33.940 --> 47:34.940
Jupyter

47:34.940 --> 47:35.940
to

47:35.940 --> 47:36.940
do

47:36.940 --> 47:37.940
some

47:37.940 --> 47:38.940
parallel

47:38.940 --> 47:39.940
computing.

47:39.940 --> 47:40.940
With

47:40.940 --> 47:41.940
these

47:41.940 --> 47:42.940
feedbacks,

47:42.940 --> 47:43.940
whether

47:43.940 --> 47:44.940
from

47:44.940 --> 47:45.940
the

47:45.940 --> 47:46.940
Jupyter

47:46.940 --> 47:47.940
Meteor

47:47.940 --> 47:48.940
team

47:48.940 --> 47:49.940
or

47:49.940 --> 47:50.940
from

47:50.940 --> 47:51.940
other

47:51.940 --> 47:52.940
communities,

47:52.940 --> 47:53.940
we

47:53.940 --> 47:54.940
are

47:54.940 --> 47:55.940
thinking

47:55.940 --> 47:56.940
about

47:56.940 --> 47:57.940
how

47:57.940 --> 47:58.940
to

47:58.940 --> 47:59.940
improve

47:59.940 --> 48:00.940
Jupyter

48:00.940 --> 48:01.940
and how

48:01.940 --> 48:02.940
to

48:02.940 --> 48:03.940
use

48:03.940 --> 48:04.940
Jupyter

48:04.940 --> 48:05.940
in

48:05.940 --> 48:06.940
real-time

48:06.940 --> 48:07.940
collaboration.

48:07.940 --> 48:08.940
This

48:08.940 --> 48:09.940
feature

48:09.940 --> 48:10.940
allows you

48:10.940 --> 48:11.940
to use

48:11.940 --> 48:12.940
Jupyter

48:12.940 --> 48:13.940
in the

48:13.940 --> 48:14.940
Google

48:14.940 --> 48:15.940
Doc

48:15.940 --> 48:16.940
way.

48:16.940 --> 48:17.940
You

48:17.940 --> 48:18.940
can

48:18.940 --> 48:19.940
share

48:19.940 --> 48:20.940

48:20.940 --> 48:21.940
with

48:21.940 --> 48:22.940
your

48:22.940 --> 48:23.940
partner

48:23.940 --> 48:24.940
and

48:24.940 --> 48:25.940
you

48:25.940 --> 48:26.940
can

48:26.940 --> 48:27.940
edit

48:27.940 --> 48:28.940
the

48:28.940 --> 48:29.940
notebook

48:29.940 --> 48:30.940
in

48:30.940 --> 48:31.940
Jupyter

48:31.940 --> 48:32.940
and

48:32.940 --> 48:33.940
you

48:33.940 --> 48:34.940
can

48:34.940 --> 48:35.940
share

48:35.940 --> 48:36.940
the

48:36.940 --> 48:37.940
notebook

48:37.940 --> 48:38.940
with

48:38.940 --> 48:39.940
your

48:39.940 --> 48:40.940
partner.

48:40.940 --> 48:41.940
You

48:41.940 --> 48:42.940
can

48:42.940 --> 48:43.940
share

48:43.940 --> 48:44.940
the

48:44.940 --> 48:45.940
notebook

48:45.940 --> 48:46.940
with

48:46.940 --> 48:47.940
your

48:47.940 --> 48:48.940
partner

48:48.940 --> 48:49.940
and

48:49.940 --> 48:50.940
you

48:50.940 --> 48:51.940
can

48:51.940 --> 48:52.940
share

48:52.940 --> 48:53.940
the

48:53.940 --> 48:54.940
notebook

48:54.940 --> 48:55.940
with

48:55.940 --> 48:56.940
your

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
partner.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.940
This

48:58.940 --> 48:59.940
feature

48:59.940 --> 49:00.940
is

49:00.940 --> 49:01.940
already

49:01.940 --> 49:02.940
very

49:02.940 --> 49:03.940
big.

49:03.940 --> 49:04.940
We

49:04.940 --> 49:05.940
find that

49:05.940 --> 49:06.940
sometimes it

49:06.940 --> 49:07.940
is even

49:07.940 --> 49:08.940
more than

49:08.940 --> 49:09.940
one

49:09.940 --> 49:10.940
scientific

49:10.940 --> 49:11.940
research

49:11.940 --> 49:12.940
talk,

49:12.940 --> 49:13.940
not

49:13.940 --> 49:14.940
two

49:14.940 --> 49:15.940
scientific

49:15.940 --> 49:16.940
research

49:16.940 --> 49:17.940
talk

49:17.940 --> 49:18.940
that

49:18.940 --> 49:19.940
can

49:19.940 --> 49:20.940
cover.

49:20.940 --> 49:21.940
So

49:21.940 --> 49:22.940
a few

49:22.940 --> 49:23.940
years

49:23.940 --> 49:24.940
ago,

49:24.940 --> 49:25.940
there

49:25.940 --> 49:26.940
was

49:26.940 --> 49:27.940
a

49:27.940 --> 49:28.940
project

49:28.940 --> 49:29.940
called

49:29.940 --> 49:30.940
Jupyter

49:30.940 --> 49:31.940
Hub.

49:31.940 --> 49:32.940
Their

49:32.940 --> 49:33.940
purpose

49:33.940 --> 49:34.940
is to

49:34.940 --> 49:35.940
design

49:35.940 --> 49:36.940
the

49:36.940 --> 49:37.940
next

49:37.940 --> 49:38.940
generation

49:38.940 --> 49:39.940
of

49:39.940 --> 49:40.940
Jupyter

49:40.940 --> 49:41.940
Hub

49:41.940 --> 49:42.940
and

49:42.940 --> 49:43.940
Jupyter

49:43.940 --> 49:44.940
Book.

49:44.940 --> 49:45.940
They

49:45.940 --> 49:46.940
also

49:46.940 --> 49:47.940
conducted

49:47.940 --> 49:48.940
many

49:48.940 --> 49:49.940
teaching

49:49.940 --> 49:50.940
and

49:50.940 --> 49:51.940
promotion

49:51.940 --> 49:52.940
activities

49:52.940 --> 49:53.940
and

49:53.940 --> 49:54.940
hope

49:54.940 --> 49:55.940
to

49:55.940 --> 49:56.940
bring

49:56.940 --> 49:57.940
the

49:57.940 --> 49:58.940
next

49:58.940 --> 49:59.940
generation

49:59.940 --> 50:00.940
of

50:00.940 --> 50:01.940
Jupyter

50:01.940 --> 50:02.940
Hub

50:02.940 --> 50:03.940
to

50:03.940 --> 50:04.940
the

50:04.940 --> 50:05.940
world.

50:05.940 --> 50:06.940
One

50:06.940 --> 50:07.940
thing that

50:07.940 --> 50:08.940
makes us

50:08.940 --> 50:09.940
very happy

50:09.940 --> 50:10.940
is that

50:10.940 --> 50:11.940
in the

50:11.940 --> 50:12.940
first two

50:12.940 --> 50:13.940
years,

50:13.940 --> 50:14.940
the

50:14.940 --> 50:15.940
whole

50:15.940 --> 50:16.940
geological

50:16.940 --> 50:17.940
community

50:17.940 --> 50:18.940
began to

50:18.940 --> 50:19.940
notice

50:19.940 --> 50:20.940
this

50:20.940 --> 50:21.940
Jupyter

50:21.940 --> 50:22.940
ecosystem

50:22.940 --> 50:23.940
and

50:23.940 --> 50:24.940
started

50:24.940 --> 50:25.940
to

50:25.940 --> 50:26.940
learn more

50:26.940 --> 50:27.940
about

50:27.940 --> 50:28.940
it.

50:28.940 --> 50:29.940
So

50:29.940 --> 50:30.940
GMVDU is

50:30.940 --> 50:31.940
a

50:31.940 --> 50:32.940
geological

50:32.940 --> 50:33.940
teaching

50:33.940 --> 50:34.940
website.

50:34.940 --> 50:35.940
You can

50:35.940 --> 50:36.940
see that

50:36.940 --> 50:37.940
their

50:37.940 --> 50:38.940
website is

50:38.940 --> 50:39.940
also

50:39.940 --> 50:40.940
written in

50:40.940 --> 50:41.940
the

50:41.940 --> 50:42.940
form of

50:42.940 --> 50:43.940
Jupyter

50:43.940 --> 50:44.940
Book.

50:44.940 --> 50:45.940
They

50:45.940 --> 50:46.940
have some

50:46.940 --> 50:47.940
very cool

50:47.940 --> 50:48.940
content.

50:48.940 --> 50:49.940
For

50:49.940 --> 50:50.940
example,

50:50.940 --> 50:51.940
there is

50:51.940 --> 50:52.940
an app

50:52.940 --> 50:53.940
here.

50:53.940 --> 50:54.940
I'm not sure

50:54.940 --> 50:55.940
if it takes

50:55.940 --> 50:56.940
some time,

50:56.940 --> 50:57.940
but if you're

50:57.940 --> 50:58.940
interested,

50:58.940 --> 50:59.940
you can

50:59.940 --> 51:00.940
try it.

51:00.940 --> 51:01.940
Then I

51:01.940 --> 51:02.940
won't operate

51:02.940 --> 51:03.940
here.

51:03.940 --> 51:04.940
Oh,

51:04.940 --> 51:05.940
okay.

51:05.940 --> 51:06.940
Then you can

51:06.940 --> 51:07.940
move around

51:07.940 --> 51:08.940
here and

51:08.940 --> 51:09.940
see what

51:09.940 --> 51:10.940
interesting

51:10.940 --> 51:11.940
things happen.

51:15.940 --> 51:16.940
So,

51:20.940 --> 51:21.940
on the

51:21.940 --> 51:22.940
other hand,

51:22.940 --> 51:23.940
in addition to

51:23.940 --> 51:24.940
these research

51:24.940 --> 51:25.940
communities,

51:25.940 --> 51:26.940
we are also very

51:26.940 --> 51:27.940
excited to

51:27.940 --> 51:28.940
say that

51:28.940 --> 51:29.940
there are more and

51:29.940 --> 51:30.940
more business

51:30.940 --> 51:31.940
communities

51:31.940 --> 51:32.940
recently.

51:32.940 --> 51:33.940
For example,

51:33.940 --> 51:34.940
Microsoft

51:34.940 --> 51:35.940
launched a

51:35.940 --> 51:36.940
plan called

51:36.940 --> 51:37.940
Planetary Computer

51:37.940 --> 51:38.940
in 2020.

51:38.940 --> 51:39.940
What

51:39.940 --> 51:40.940
they

51:40.940 --> 51:41.940
actually want

51:41.940 --> 51:42.940
to do is

51:42.940 --> 51:43.940
provide

51:43.940 --> 51:44.940
Microsoft's

51:44.940 --> 51:45.940
budget

51:45.940 --> 51:46.940
resources

51:46.940 --> 51:47.940
to the

51:47.940 --> 51:48.940
geological

51:48.940 --> 51:49.940
community.

51:49.940 --> 51:50.940
Their

51:50.940 --> 51:51.940
stock price

51:51.940 --> 51:52.940
has increased

51:52.940 --> 51:53.940
significantly.

51:53.940 --> 51:54.940
With these

51:54.940 --> 51:55.940
business communities,

51:55.940 --> 51:56.940
I personally

51:56.940 --> 51:57.940
think that

51:57.940 --> 51:58.940
the investment

51:58.940 --> 51:59.940
of these

51:59.940 --> 52:00.940
business communities

52:00.940 --> 52:01.940
can make

52:01.940 --> 52:02.940
this Jupiter

52:02.940 --> 52:03.940
ecosystem more

52:03.940 --> 52:04.940
perfect and

52:04.940 --> 52:05.940
truly become

52:05.940 --> 52:06.940
the data

52:06.940 --> 52:07.940
analysis standard

52:07.940 --> 52:08.940
for geological

52:08.940 --> 52:09.940
research in

52:09.940 --> 52:10.940
the next

52:10.940 --> 52:11.940
era.

52:11.940 --> 52:12.940
That's

52:12.940 --> 52:13.940
my

52:13.940 --> 52:14.940
share

52:14.940 --> 52:15.940
for today.

52:15.940 --> 52:16.940
Thank you

52:16.940 --> 52:17.940
all.

52:17.940 --> 52:18.940
If you have any

52:18.940 --> 52:19.940
questions,

52:19.940 --> 52:20.940
please

52:20.940 --> 52:21.940
let me know.

52:21.940 --> 52:22.940
Thank you,

52:22.940 --> 52:23.940
Huaijie.

52:23.940 --> 52:24.940
Do you have

52:24.940 --> 52:25.940
any questions

52:25.940 --> 52:26.940
you want to

52:26.940 --> 52:27.940
ask?

52:27.940 --> 52:28.940
Can I

52:28.940 --> 52:29.940
ask a question?

52:29.940 --> 52:30.940
Sure.

52:30.940 --> 52:31.940
Who was

52:31.940 --> 52:32.940
that?

52:32.940 --> 52:33.940
Me.

52:33.940 --> 52:34.940
I'll

52:34.940 --> 52:35.940
go first.

52:35.940 --> 52:36.940
Hi,

52:36.940 --> 52:37.940
Huaijie.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.940
I'm

52:38.940 --> 52:39.940
Wangjie.

52:39.940 --> 52:40.940
Hi.

52:40.940 --> 52:41.940
I actually

52:41.940 --> 52:42.940
have a

52:42.940 --> 52:43.940
very

52:43.940 --> 52:44.940
basic

52:44.940 --> 52:45.940
question

52:45.940 --> 52:46.940
that I

52:46.940 --> 52:47.940
want to

52:47.940 --> 52:48.940
ask.

52:48.940 --> 52:49.940
What

52:49.940 --> 52:50.940
is the

52:50.940 --> 52:51.940
basic

52:51.940 --> 52:52.940
question?

52:52.940 --> 52:53.940
How

52:53.940 --> 52:54.940
does a

52:54.940 --> 52:55.940
Jupiter

52:55.940 --> 52:56.940
user

52:56.940 --> 52:57.940
get into

52:57.940 --> 52:58.940
a

52:58.940 --> 52:59.940
developer?

52:59.940 --> 53:00.940
I'm

53:00.940 --> 53:01.940
curious about

53:01.940 --> 53:02.940
this.

53:02.940 --> 53:03.940
I'm a

53:03.940 --> 53:04.940
heavy

53:04.940 --> 53:05.940
Jupiter

53:05.940 --> 53:06.940
user,

53:06.940 --> 53:07.940
but I

53:07.940 --> 53:08.940
always feel

53:08.940 --> 53:09.940
that there

53:09.940 --> 53:10.940
is a

53:10.940 --> 53:11.940
big

53:11.940 --> 53:12.940
red

53:12.940 --> 53:13.940
line for

53:13.940 --> 53:14.940
developers.

53:14.940 --> 53:15.940
I'm

53:15.940 --> 53:16.940
curious

53:16.940 --> 53:17.940
about

53:17.940 --> 53:18.940
how

53:18.940 --> 53:19.940
you

53:19.940 --> 53:20.940
get

53:20.940 --> 53:21.940
into

53:21.940 --> 53:22.940
this

53:22.940 --> 53:23.940
red

53:23.940 --> 53:24.940
line.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.940
Thank

53:25.940 --> 53:26.940
you.

53:26.940 --> 53:27.940
For me,

53:27.940 --> 53:28.940
I think

53:28.940 --> 53:29.940
Jupiter is

53:29.940 --> 53:30.940
pretty

53:30.940 --> 53:31.940
grassroots.

53:31.940 --> 53:32.940
They

53:32.940 --> 53:33.940
have a

53:33.940 --> 53:34.940
very active

53:34.940 --> 53:35.940
community

53:35.940 --> 53:36.940
interaction.

53:36.940 --> 53:37.940
Some

53:37.940 --> 53:38.940
software

53:38.940 --> 53:39.940
don't

53:39.940 --> 53:40.940
have that

53:40.940 --> 53:41.940
strong

53:41.940 --> 53:42.940
connection

53:42.940 --> 53:43.940
between

53:43.940 --> 53:44.940
developers and

53:44.940 --> 53:45.940
users.

53:45.940 --> 53:46.940
But

53:46.940 --> 53:47.940
Jupiter

53:47.940 --> 53:48.940
has a

53:48.940 --> 53:49.940
very active

53:49.940 --> 53:50.940
community

53:50.940 --> 53:51.940
interaction.

53:51.940 --> 53:52.940
I think

53:52.940 --> 53:53.940
if you're

53:53.940 --> 53:54.940
interested in

53:54.940 --> 53:55.940
developing

53:55.940 --> 53:56.940
Jupiter,

53:56.940 --> 53:57.940
I think

53:57.940 --> 53:58.940
you can

53:58.940 --> 53:59.940
start by

53:59.940 --> 54:00.940
joining their

54:00.940 --> 54:01.940
discussion

54:01.940 --> 54:02.940
group.

54:02.940 --> 54:03.940
Jupiter

54:03.940 --> 54:04.940
itself

54:04.940 --> 54:05.940
has a

54:05.940 --> 54:06.940
GitHub.

54:06.940 --> 54:07.940
In addition

54:07.940 --> 54:08.940
to the

54:08.940 --> 54:09.940
GitHub issue,

54:09.940 --> 54:10.940
you can post

54:10.940 --> 54:11.940
your questions

54:11.940 --> 54:12.940
or participate

54:12.940 --> 54:13.940
in the

54:13.940 --> 54:14.940
discussion.

54:14.940 --> 54:15.940
They

54:15.940 --> 54:16.940
also have

54:16.940 --> 54:17.940
a

54:17.940 --> 54:18.940
discussion

54:18.940 --> 54:19.940
group.

54:19.940 --> 54:20.940
They

54:20.940 --> 54:21.940
have a

54:21.940 --> 54:22.940
discussion

54:22.940 --> 54:23.940
group.

54:23.940 --> 54:24.940
Okay.

54:24.940 --> 54:25.940
Here

54:25.940 --> 54:26.940
is a

54:26.940 --> 54:27.940
link.

54:27.940 --> 54:28.940
In

54:28.940 --> 54:29.940
addition to

54:29.940 --> 54:30.940
the

54:30.940 --> 54:31.940
discussion,

54:31.940 --> 54:32.940
let me

54:32.940 --> 54:33.940
see.

54:33.940 --> 54:34.940
I

54:34.940 --> 54:35.940
find

54:35.940 --> 54:36.940
something.

54:36.940 --> 54:37.940
Yes,

54:37.940 --> 54:38.940
that's

54:38.940 --> 54:39.940
right.

54:39.940 --> 54:40.940
So,

54:40.940 --> 54:41.940
in addition

54:41.940 --> 54:42.940
to the

54:42.940 --> 54:43.940
discussion,

54:43.940 --> 54:44.940
they also

54:44.940 --> 54:45.940
have some

54:45.940 --> 54:46.940
discussion groups.

54:46.940 --> 54:47.940
In these

54:47.940 --> 54:48.940
two places,

54:48.940 --> 54:49.940
Discourse and

54:49.940 --> 54:50.940
GitHub,

54:50.940 --> 54:51.940
many

54:51.940 --> 54:52.940
users

54:52.940 --> 54:53.940
will

54:53.940 --> 54:54.940
post

54:54.940 --> 54:55.940
questions

54:55.940 --> 54:56.940
and answer

54:56.940 --> 54:57.940
questions.

54:57.940 --> 54:58.940
You will

54:58.940 --> 54:59.940
see many

54:59.940 --> 55:00.940
developers

55:00.940 --> 55:01.940
coming and

55:01.940 --> 55:02.940
going.

55:02.940 --> 55:03.940
So,

55:03.940 --> 55:04.940
I think

55:04.940 --> 55:05.940
if you

55:05.940 --> 55:06.940
want to

55:06.940 --> 55:07.940
go from

55:07.940 --> 55:08.940
users to

55:08.940 --> 55:09.940
developers,

55:09.940 --> 55:10.940
the first

55:10.940 --> 55:11.940
step is

55:11.940 --> 55:12.940
to

55:12.940 --> 55:13.940
establish

55:13.940 --> 55:14.940
your

55:14.940 --> 55:15.940
team.

55:15.940 --> 55:16.940
And

55:16.940 --> 55:17.940
then you

55:17.940 --> 55:18.940
can feel

55:18.940 --> 55:19.940
which

55:19.940 --> 55:20.940
questions

55:20.940 --> 55:21.940
they really

55:21.940 --> 55:22.940
want to

55:22.940 --> 55:23.940
solve now.

55:23.940 --> 55:24.940
These

55:24.940 --> 55:25.940
questions

55:25.940 --> 55:26.940
may be

55:26.940 --> 55:27.940
very

55:27.940 --> 55:28.940
detailed,

55:28.940 --> 55:29.940
but

55:29.940 --> 55:30.940
these

55:30.940 --> 55:31.940
detailed

55:31.940 --> 55:32.940
questions

55:32.940 --> 55:33.940
are

55:33.940 --> 55:34.940
easier

55:34.940 --> 55:35.940
for

55:35.940 --> 55:36.940
developers

55:36.940 --> 55:37.940
to

55:37.940 --> 55:38.940
handle.

55:38.940 --> 55:39.940
Through

55:39.940 --> 55:40.940
these

55:40.940 --> 55:41.940
detailed

55:41.940 --> 55:42.940
questions,

55:42.940 --> 55:43.940
you can

55:43.940 --> 55:44.940
get

55:44.940 --> 55:45.940
a better

55:45.940 --> 55:46.940
understanding

55:46.940 --> 55:47.940
of

55:47.940 --> 55:48.940
the

55:48.940 --> 55:49.940
problem.

55:49.940 --> 55:50.940
So,

55:50.940 --> 55:51.940
I think

55:51.940 --> 55:52.940
that's

55:52.940 --> 55:53.940
all.

55:53.940 --> 55:54.940
Thank you.

55:54.940 --> 55:55.940

Hello,

56:41.940 --> 56:42.940
Hello,

56:42.940 --> 56:43.940
I have a

56:43.940 --> 56:44.940
question.

56:44.940 --> 56:45.940
In the last

56:45.940 --> 56:46.940
statistics,

56:46.940 --> 56:47.940
how do you

56:47.940 --> 56:48.940
share

56:48.940 --> 56:49.940
your

56:49.940 --> 56:50.940
research

56:50.940 --> 56:51.940
from

56:51.940 --> 56:52.940
your own

56:52.940 --> 56:53.940
research

56:53.940 --> 56:54.940
from the

56:54.940 --> 56:55.940
program to

56:55.940 --> 56:56.940
a readable

56:56.940 --> 56:57.940
page or

56:57.940 --> 56:58.940
a Jupyter

56:58.940 --> 56:59.940
book?

56:59.940 --> 57:00.940
For

57:00.940 --> 57:01.940
example,

57:01.940 --> 57:02.940
you

57:02.940 --> 57:03.940
just

57:03.940 --> 57:04.940
quickly

57:04.940 --> 57:05.940
looked at

57:05.940 --> 57:06.940
a lot of

57:06.940 --> 57:07.940
GitHub

57:07.940 --> 57:08.940
or

57:08.940 --> 57:09.940
your

57:09.940 --> 57:10.940
Jupyter

57:10.940 --> 57:11.940
book.

57:11.940 --> 57:12.940
I

57:12.940 --> 57:13.940
want to

57:13.940 --> 57:14.940
ask,

57:14.940 --> 57:15.940
for

57:15.940 --> 57:16.940
example,

57:16.940 --> 57:17.940
how do

57:17.940 --> 57:18.940
you define

57:18.940 --> 57:19.940
or how

57:19.940 --> 57:20.940
does your

57:20.940 --> 57:21.940
workflow

57:21.940 --> 57:22.940
work?

57:22.940 --> 57:23.940
How

57:23.940 --> 57:24.940
do you

57:24.940 --> 57:25.940
combine

57:25.940 --> 57:26.940
your

57:26.940 --> 57:27.940
work

57:27.940 --> 57:28.940
and

57:28.940 --> 57:29.940
your

57:29.940 --> 57:30.940
GitHub

57:30.940 --> 57:31.940
and

57:31.940 --> 57:32.940
publish?

57:32.940 --> 57:33.940
What

57:33.940 --> 57:34.940
tools

57:34.940 --> 57:35.940
are

57:35.940 --> 57:36.940
needed?

57:36.940 --> 57:37.940
How

57:37.940 --> 57:38.940
do you

57:38.940 --> 57:39.940
combine

57:39.940 --> 57:40.940
your

57:40.940 --> 57:41.940
work and

57:41.940 --> 57:42.940
your

57:42.940 --> 57:43.940
GitHub?

57:43.940 --> 57:44.940
I

57:44.940 --> 57:45.940
think

57:45.940 --> 57:46.940
we don't

57:46.940 --> 57:47.940
have the

57:47.940 --> 57:48.940
most standard

57:48.940 --> 57:49.940
answer yet.

57:49.940 --> 57:50.940
We

57:50.940 --> 57:51.940
want to

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
now,

57:52.940 --> 57:53.940
we

57:53.940 --> 57:54.940
think there

57:54.940 --> 57:55.940
is a

57:55.940 --> 57:56.940
way to

57:56.940 --> 57:57.940
do it.

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
For

57:58.940 --> 57:59.940
a

57:59.940 --> 58:00.940
research

58:00.940 --> 58:01.940
team,

58:01.940 --> 58:02.940
they can

58:02.940 --> 58:03.940
have a

58:03.940 --> 58:04.940
shared

58:04.940 --> 58:05.940
work environment.

58:05.940 --> 58:06.940
This

58:06.940 --> 58:07.940
work

58:07.940 --> 58:08.940
environment

58:08.940 --> 58:09.940
is

58:09.940 --> 58:10.940
JupyterHub.

58:10.940 --> 58:11.940
You

58:11.940 --> 58:12.940
can install

58:12.940 --> 58:13.940
JupyterHub on

58:13.940 --> 58:14.940
your

58:14.940 --> 58:15.940
computer

58:15.940 --> 58:16.940
or

58:16.940 --> 58:17.940
a

58:17.940 --> 58:18.940
cloud

58:18.940 --> 58:19.940
resource.

58:19.940 --> 58:20.940
In

58:20.940 --> 58:21.940
this way,

58:21.940 --> 58:22.940
all your

58:22.940 --> 58:23.940
research

58:23.940 --> 58:24.940
materials,

58:24.940 --> 58:25.940
code,

58:25.940 --> 58:26.940
data,

58:26.940 --> 58:27.940
etc.

58:27.940 --> 58:28.940
are

58:28.940 --> 58:29.940
basically

58:29.940 --> 58:30.940
in the

58:30.940 --> 58:31.940
cloud.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.940
You

58:32.940 --> 58:33.940
don't

58:33.940 --> 58:34.940
need

58:34.940 --> 58:35.940
your

58:35.940 --> 58:36.940
computer.

58:36.940 --> 58:37.940
If

58:37.940 --> 58:38.940
you

58:38.940 --> 58:39.940
are

58:39.940 --> 58:40.940
using

58:40.940 --> 58:41.940
GitHub,

58:41.940 --> 58:42.940
you

58:42.940 --> 58:43.940
can

58:43.940 --> 58:44.940
connect

58:44.940 --> 58:45.940
GitHub to

58:45.940 --> 58:46.940
JupyterHub.

58:46.940 --> 58:47.940
We

58:47.940 --> 58:48.940
are

58:48.940 --> 58:49.940
using

58:49.940 --> 58:50.940
GitHub's

58:50.940 --> 58:51.940
identity

58:51.940 --> 58:52.940
authentication

58:52.940 --> 58:53.940
to

58:53.940 --> 58:54.940
log in

58:54.940 --> 58:55.940
to

JupyterHub.

58:56.940 --> 58:57.940
Our

58:57.940 --> 58:58.940
JupyterHub

58:58.940 --> 58:59.940
has

58:59.940 --> 59:00.940
an

59:00.940 --> 59:01.940
administrator

59:01.940 --> 59:02.940
who

59:02.940 --> 59:03.940
manages

the

59:04.940 --> 59:05.940
environment

59:05.940 --> 59:06.940
in

59:06.940 --> 59:07.940
JupyterHub.

59:07.940 --> 59:08.940
If

59:08.940 --> 59:09.940
you are

59:09.940 --> 59:10.940
using

59:10.940 --> 59:11.940
Python or

59:11.940 --> 59:12.940
Conda,

59:12.940 --> 59:13.940
you

59:13.940 --> 59:14.940
will

59:14.940 --> 59:15.940
have

59:15.940 --> 59:16.940
a

59:16.940 --> 59:17.940
pre-set

59:17.940 --> 59:18.940
environment.

59:18.940 --> 59:19.940
Of

59:19.940 --> 59:20.940
course,

59:20.940 --> 59:21.940
every

59:21.940 --> 59:22.940

their

59:25.940 --> 59:26.940

59:26.940 --> 59:27.940
on

59:27.940 --> 59:28.940
their

59:28.940 --> 59:29.940
own.

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
You

59:30.940 --> 59:31.940
can

59:31.940 --> 59:32.940
choose

59:32.940 --> 59:33.940

59:35.940 --> 59:36.940
JupyterHub.

59:36.940 --> 59:37.940
Whether

59:37.940 --> 59:38.940
it's

59:38.940 --> 59:39.940
a public

59:39.940 --> 59:40.940
way or

59:40.940 --> 59:41.940
a GitHub

59:41.940 --> 59:42.940
member,

59:42.940 --> 59:43.940
you

59:43.940 --> 59:44.940
can

59:44.940 --> 59:45.940

59:51.940 --> 59:52.940
The

59:52.940 --> 59:53.940
advantage is

59:53.940 --> 59:54.940
that

59:54.940 --> 59:55.940
whether

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.940
possible.

This

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940

that

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.940
called

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.940
EarthCube.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.940
I

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940
think that

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940
you can imagine it as

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.940
an organization

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.940
under NSF.

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940
I just posted a link.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940
You can see what they are doing.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.940
They are

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.940
an organization

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.940
that

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.940
applies for funds from NSF.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.940
They invite

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940
other people

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940
to join their organization.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.940
They invite other people to join their organization.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.940
These plans are related to

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.940
data, tools,

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.940
and research.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.940
These plans are related to

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.940
data, tools, and research.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.940
They save money for these plans.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.940
It's like

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.940
indirectly

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.940
applying for

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.940
funds from NSF.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.940
applying for funds from NSF.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.940
You mean that

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.940
EarthCube's funds

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.940
are not entirely from NSF?

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.940
I think that

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.940
their funds

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.940
are entirely from NSF.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.940
I think that

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.940
their funds are entirely from NSF.

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.940
I think that

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.940
their funds are entirely from NSF.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.940
EarthCube's organization

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.940
is based on

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.940
one of NSF's plans.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.940
You can see the number of plans.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.940
You can see the number of plans.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.940
They are using

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.940
this kind of funds.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940
But there is still a problem.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.940
But there is still a problem.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940
There is a problem

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.940
that I think is interesting.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.940
A few days ago,

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.940
EarthCube had a meeting.

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.940
They discussed that

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.940
if there is a data repository

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.940
how can the traditional

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.940
way of applying for funds

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.940
to maintain the data repository

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:52.940
to maintain the data repository

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.940
to maintain the data repository

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940
If we really follow

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.940
the traditional way,

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.940
we will definitely run out of funds

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.940
and the plan will be terminated.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.940
I don't think

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.940
they have a very good answer

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.940
I don't think they have a very good answer

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.940
because no matter what the answer is,

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.940
it takes a lot of effort,

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:14.940
but it is a very difficult challenge

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:14.940


01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.940
and you can ask

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.940
if they can change this.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.940
if they can change this.

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:20.940


01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.940
It takes a long time

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.940
before you can do it.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.940
It takes a long time before you can do it.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.940
It is not like the short-term

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.940
or two to three-year preservation

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.940
That's about it.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.940
That's about it.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.940
We are still figuring out more.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.940
We are still figuring out more.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.940
Thank you for your research.

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.940
It is true that

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.940
we need someone to do this.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.940
It is true that we need someone to do this.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.940
It is true that we need someone to do this.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.940
Someone just posted

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.940
Thank you.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.940
NASA is a

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.940
I think

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.940
it is a

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.940
very forward-looking organization

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.940
on this issue.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940
They announced

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.940
a plan

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.940
last year or the year before

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.940
that after a certain year

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.940
that after a certain year

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.940
all the data of NASA

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.940
must meet the standards of Open Science

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.940
must meet the standards of Open Science

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.940
must meet the standards of Open Science

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.940
including the data before

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.940
and the data now collected

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.940
must be in line with

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.940
the data now collected

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.940
This requires a lot of people

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.940
to do it.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.940
to do it.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.940
to do it.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.940
Do you have any questions?

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.940
Do you have any questions?

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.940
Can I ask a question?

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.940
Go ahead.

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.940
I have two questions.

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.940
The first one is

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.940
I have left the country

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.940
I don't know if I mentioned it last year.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.940
I am sorry if I did.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.940
I am sorry if I did.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.940
I first learned Python

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.940
and then I started using Jupyter

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.940
and then I started using Jupyter

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.940
and then I started using Jupyter

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:06.940
demo

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.940
demo

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.940
demo

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.940
demo

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.940
In science complex

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.940
In science complex

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.940
In science complex

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.940
With Jupyter

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.940
Take Python script code

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.940
and Use metadata plot

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940
and Use metadata plot

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.940
and Use metadata plot

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.940
In this comparison

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.940
In this comparison

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:40.940
What do you think is the advantage?

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.940
Or the interaction?

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.940
Because interaction has other tools

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.940
we can use

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.940
I haven't found out

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.940
I haven't found out

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.940
why we should use Jupyter

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.940
and not Python script

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.940
and not Python script

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.940
And use command line

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.940
to draw, and plot

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.940
And the second question

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.940
is about data structure

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.940
Because you mentioned

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.940
there is another

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.940
data structure in D-technology

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.940
called X-array

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.940
And

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.940
I know the data format

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.940
of HDF5

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.940
Because what I'm doing now

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.940
is more about earthquake science

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.940
And when we collect data

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.940
there will be

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.940
large size

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.940
and time

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.940
So the data structure

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.940
is a big problem

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.940
HDF5 is very efficient

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.940
So I want to ask

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.940
When you use X-array

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.940
What are the advantages

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.940
compared to HDF5?

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.940
Or why

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.940
HDF5 used a long time

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.940
in geophysics

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.940
It looks like the format you are used to

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.940
Why not use X-array?

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.940
And

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.940
To answer

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.940
the question

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.940
If you want to promote a tool

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.940
How to promote a tool?

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.940
Convince people it's fast

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.940
And they will use it

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.940
I was convinced

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.940
Our research team

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.940
My boss

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.940
asked me to find

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.940
a suitable database

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.940
The database I used was SQL

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.940
So I talked about SQL

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.940
But later I found

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.940
Many people only use HDF5

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.940
I was thinking

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.940
How come I never heard of SQL

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.940
SQL is so fast

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.940
Why use HDF5?

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.940
After using it

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.940
I found HDF5 is faster

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.940
and has advantages

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.940
So I was convinced

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.940
If you want to promote

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.940
Let it know how fast it is

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.940
So the above two questions

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.940
Please answer

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.940
Ok

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.940
The first question

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.940
Is to ask

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.940
What are the advantages of Jupyter compared to PythonScript?

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.940
The second question

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.940
is

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.940
What is the second question?

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.940
The second question is the data structure

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.940
Why there is an X-array

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.940
X-array VS HDF5

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.940
Ok

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.940
The first question

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.940
I have two different answers

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.940
The first answer is simple

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.940
Jupyter Notebook

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.940
Compared to PythonScript

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.940
It can contain more files

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.940
When you write PythonScript

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.940
You can only put

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:32.940
You can only put

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.940
files in the folder

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940
But

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.940
And the format of the file

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.940
can only be in text

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.940
It can't be in some

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.940
For example, LaTeX or pictures

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.940
But in Jupyter

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.940
You can put

01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.940
But in Jupyter

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.940
You can put

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.940
You can put

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.940
You can use different

01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.940
Markdown format to write

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940
Then you can

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.940
You can use LaTeX to mark your

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.940
Mathematics

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.940
You can even insert a picture

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.940
Insert a video

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.940
Insert different links

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.940
These extra things

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.940
Can be used in a better way

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.940
To explain why you want to

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.940
Or when your format

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.940
After a picture

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.940
You can directly explain below

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.940
What happened in the picture

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.940
The advantage is

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.940
In the format block

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.940
Jupyter Notebook will display the result directly

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940
This is also a general PythonScript

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.940
Can't do

01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.940
So simply put

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940
Jupyter Notebook

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.940
Can make you do

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.940
In

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.940
When writing your format

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.940
You can put all your

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.940
Explanation

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.940
To be included

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940
This is a simple answer

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940
The complicated answer is that we want to

01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.940
Through Jupyter Notebook to change

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.940
After we write

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940
The standard of academic articles

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.940
Especially in

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.940
Ah

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.940
Or in that

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.940
Supplemental information

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.940
Then I just had something

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.940
Ah

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.940
I recently uploaded an article

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.940
Here I am still writing

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.940
Not yet published

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.940
But his

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.940
Supplemental information

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.940
In fact

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.940
In fact, there are many notebooks

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.940
In the past

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.940
In an era without notebooks

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.940
If you really want to upload the format to others

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.940
Then there will be a format and an article

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.940
Then maybe add a lot of

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:40.940
The picture of the format

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.940
Then we can put it all together in a document

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.940
Then arrange them so that

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.940
The reader can be more accurate

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.940
What happened in these things

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.940
Then others can

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.940
Easier to follow

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.940
Ah to execute

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.940
To review your results

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940
This is the first question

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.940
The second question is

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.940
Ah

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.940
In my opinion, HDF5 and

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.940
Xray actually

01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.940
It's not a conflict between the two

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940
HDF5

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.940
Ah

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.940
Its advantage is

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940
Ah

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.940
Ah

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.940
With reading

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.940
It is

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:24.940
The data stored in the structure

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.940
So reading is fast

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.940
Then you have to

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.940
Draw a few layers of data at any time

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.940
Then Xray

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.940
It's actually on the data

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.940
Optimized especially in

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.940
If you use Xray

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.940
To read a array

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Then

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.940
This array can be easily cut into several

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.940
Different small arrays

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.940
Then each array is sent directly to the different

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.940
Ah

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.940
Different parallel processing workers

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.940
Then start parallel processing directly

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.940
So I would say the two of them

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.940
There are different interests in data analysis

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.940
It's not

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.940
It's not a set of conflicts

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.940
OK

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.940
I just had a notification on my phone

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.940
So I just interrupted you

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.940
I just heard you say

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.940
So you think Xray is mainly because it can

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940
Parallel processing in this regard

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.940
Is it like this?

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:18.940
Ah, I didn't say it was an advantage

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.940
I said they were dealing with different things

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.940
Oh, OK

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.940
Because HDF5 can actually

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.940
Use parallel processing to read

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.940
The data inside

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.940
Does that make sense?

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.940
The difference is even smaller

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.940
No, Xray

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:36.940
The data structure processed by Xray

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.940
Only Array

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.940
Oh, OK, I understand

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.940
So

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.940
But it's for Array

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.940
This data structure has done a lot of optimization

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.940
OK

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.940
So yeah, so I still think

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.940
They are actually two different things

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.940
You won't hear that someone is in Xray

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:56.940
Put a bunch of metadata

01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.940
Oh, I understand

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.940
Thank you

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.940
Thank you

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.940
Can I ask another question?

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.940
OK

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.940
Please

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.940
In the chat

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.940
I put a link

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.940
In the chat

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.940
It's a github data website

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.940
Very suitable for

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.940
The audience to directly read

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.940
Your stuff

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.940
Is that version directly from github

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.940
You can turn it into that format

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.940
Or is it another design?

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940
Yes

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940
It is

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.940
An automated process

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.940
Directly from that github

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.940
Turned into a version suitable for reading

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.940
Can I share my screen?

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.940
To explain this question

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.940
You may need a screen

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.940
OK

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.940
This is my

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:54.940
Check where my github is

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.940
Suppose this

01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.940
Suppose this

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.940
Suppose there is a

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:02.940
Github storage

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.940
So if I want to automatically

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.940
Turn this storage into

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.940
Github page

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.940
Then I am through

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940
A github action

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.940
The script does

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:16.940
So you go here

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.940
You can see what I did

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.940
Then there will be some

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.940
Things you will see

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.940
Every time you submit

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.940
Then there will be a github action

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.940
Execute here

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.940
This action is actually

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.940
Automatic

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.940
Put in

01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.940
What's in the github folder

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.940
To compile

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.940
The github page you see

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.940
If you are interested

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.940
You can ask me how to do it

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.940
But if you want to know

01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.940
What is in this action

01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:50.940
There is a

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.940
The folder is called

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.940
You can see here

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.940
There is a build

01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:58.940
This is probably

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.940
You want to let this github action

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.940
Execute the necessary settings

01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:04.940
That's about it

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.940
Simply put, that's it

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.940
So you need to have this workflow

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.940
You need to have a folder

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.940
Tell this workflow how to compile

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.940
Your file

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.940
That's it

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:18.940
I think this

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:20.940
This thing feels like

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.940
A lot of areas will be interested

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.940
It looks like

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.940
Everyone here should be quite interested

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.940
I would suggest you

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.940
For example, we invite you

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.940
To open a workshop during the summer vacation

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.940
To teach everyone how to do this

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.940
Sure

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.940
Of course

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.940
Everyone is very interested

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.940
Share

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.940
Current practice

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.940
OK

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.940
Maybe there are a few other things

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.940
You can

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.940
Anyway, I may contact you later

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.940
No problem

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.940
Is there any problem here?

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.940
Jack said thank you for sharing

01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:12.940
Thank you everyone

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:14.940
Thank you everyone for being there until the last moment

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.940
Thank you very much

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.940
It's really interesting

01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.940
OK

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.940
That's the end of our speech today

01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.940
That's the end of our speech today

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.940
Thank you very much

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.940
Then we will meet again later

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.940
No problem

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.940
If you are interested

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.940
If you have more questions, please contact me

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.940
I will post my email here

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.940
Quickly

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.940
Thank you

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:42.940
So you can know

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.940
How to contact me

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940
