1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to the Taira Talk.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Taira stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is an area for young researchers in Taiwan.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We hold the Taira Talk almost every week.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The format of the talk is very free and diverse.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We hope that Taiwan's academic researchers

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
can share their talk or practice online

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
according to their own needs.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The topic of the next two weeks

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
will be more on astronomy.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
On July 2nd,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is a topic on aerospace and mechanical engineering.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Today, we are very happy to invite

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Professor Wang is interested in

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
privacy, immigration, children and family well-being.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These topics will be covered in today's talk.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The topic of today's talk is

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Social Safety Net Feature in East Asia.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Julia, you can share your screen now.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me turn off my sharing.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sorry.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Can you see me clearly now?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can you hear my children crying?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Not yet.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's good.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I start now?

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's give a round of applause.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is a small tradition of Taira.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please turn on the microphone

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and give a round of applause to welcome Julia.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you, Theta, for inviting me to share my research with you.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you, Theta, for your detailed introduction.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Today, I will talk about

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the social welfare network

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and its features in East Asia.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We will cover the situation before and after COVID-19 pandemic.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know that many of you

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
may not know much about social welfare.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me give you a brief introduction.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Social welfare can be divided into three areas,

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
including social insurance, social assistance, and welfare services.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Social insurance is a risk factor in our lives.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Many countries use insurance to deal with it.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
However, there are also many countries that do not use insurance.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In Taiwan, we have a social insurance system

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
for pensioners.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Employment insurance also includes unemployment insurance.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
National Insurance is also a social insurance feature.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We need to contribute so that we can benefit in the future.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Another part is social assistance.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In some cases,

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
everyone may face risks.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For example, if you become very poor and unemployed,

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and your job does not allow you to have social insurance,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
or if you encounter some changes in your family,

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you may need social assistance,

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
including low-income households and middle-income households.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In the U.S., we have food stamps,

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which are food-related relief measures.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In the U.S., Section 8 of the Housing Assistance Act

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
uses housing vouchers to help people.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There is also public housing in Taiwan.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In addition, there are also measures to help families

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
who cannot afford to send their children to school.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In addition to social assistance,

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
there are also welfare services.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For example,

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
child abuse or elderly care services

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
may be needed.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whether it's public or private,

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
welfare services are provided by welfare agencies.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So the social welfare sector is mostly related to Hanguas.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will focus on the social assistance sector today.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will focus on the social assistance sector today.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In the introduction of the document,

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
we often compare the social insurance and social assistance

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in the East Asian welfare system.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In the East Asian welfare system,

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we often compare the social insurance and social assistance.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I will explain the terms first.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The research I am going to share today

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
was initiated in 2019

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
by Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo was invited by the National University of Seoul

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to give a lecture at their school.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to give a lecture at their school.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think organizing research teams

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is a bit like making a movie.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In my mind,

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
However, it takes a lot of resources

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
to gather all the party members from all over the world.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to gather all the party members from all over the world.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
After this meeting,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is a professor at Tokyo University in Japan.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is a professor at Tokyo University in Japan.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is interested in Korea.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is interested in Korea.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I invited Dr. Irene from the National University of Singapore

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and Dr. Chen Hong and Dr. Zhao Hsieh

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
from the National University of Singapore.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We organized a research team to study six places in East Asia,

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We organized a research team to study six places in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We relate to projects on Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We relate to projects on Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We will compare and analyze tests on the six places we study.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We will compare and analyze tests on the six places we study.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There are thirty buildings with shrines in the north along theheir names.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are twenty buildings with shrines in the north along their names.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We will compare and analyze tests on the these buildings together.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
