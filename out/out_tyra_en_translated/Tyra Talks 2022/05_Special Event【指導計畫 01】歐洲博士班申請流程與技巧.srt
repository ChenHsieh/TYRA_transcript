1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, maybe I can think about it first. I probably won't provide slides because I know a lot of participants will want slides, but I won't provide slides.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Anyway, there are recordings, so I think it should be fine.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Taira is a friendly environment for young researchers in Taiwan.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We hold Taira Talk every weekend.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The format and content of this talk are very diverse.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Academic researchers can share their research results here according to their occupations,

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and also practice live presentations or meet future potential partners.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today is the first lecture of the Taira 2022 Overseas Researcher Application Guidelines.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The topic is European Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Next week will be the North American Doctoral Class Application Procedures and Skills.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Next week, August 28th, will be two types of application documents, CV and SOP writing skills.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We mentioned in the propaganda file and application form that if you are willing to participate in one-on-one Ph.D. application mentoring,

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
if you sign up and attend the first or second lecture, plus the third CV and SOP writing lecture,

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you will have the opportunity to mentor first.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let me briefly explain this one-on-one guidance.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This year, we have invited many young scholars with overseas study experience to serve as mentors

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to help Taiwanese students prepare for various applications,

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
such as school consultations, interview preparation, etc.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The mentors selected can apply for mentors according to their own conditions, such as the field of research, the target school, etc.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then the mentors can choose mentors that are suitable for help according to their personal wishes.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We expect to recruit about 100 mentors this year,

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
because the registration situation in the past was quite intense,

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so if the number of applicants exceeds,

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
if you participate in this series of lectures in August, you will have the opportunity to mentor first.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So we highly encourage everyone to participate in the third CV and SOP lecture.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
At the same time, we also hope that everyone can listen to our other TerraTalks in the future.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We have continued to update the lecture list on our official website.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are also welcome to follow our Facebook and Instagram.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can also join the Terra membership for free and enjoy more membership exclusive rights.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can have more interactions with other mentors.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I will post the registration form for joining the membership in the chat later.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Today's event will issue a Terra badge as a certificate of participation.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is an NFT, which is a completely open and unalterable record.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For more information, please see the chat link.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
To join the certificate, you must first install the PoAP app.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can first scan the QR code in the chat link to install the PoAP app.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We will announce the password to receive the badge after the lecture.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If your phone cannot install the app, please stay after the lecture.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We will help you solve it.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Later, we will invite two speakers to share their thoughts.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After the lecture, we will have a Q&A session.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Finally, we will issue the NFT.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Today, we welcome the first speaker.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He is Dr. Zhang Zhaoyuan from the University of Dresden.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
His field of research is business engineering.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
According to Terra's tradition, we will turn on the microphone.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will end my slideshare.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I will turn on the microphone again.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his thoughts.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you for the invitation, Project Terra.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will share my experience applying for a university in Europe.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I am Zhang Zhaoyuan.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
As the host said, I am currently studying my Ph.D. at Dresden.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Before coming to Germany, I studied at Cornell University.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I studied Biomedical Engineering for one year.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will not talk about the U.S. part of today's talk.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know if you are still hesitating to apply for a university in the U.S. or Europe.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will leave this part for Q&A.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have a few slides to share about the difference between the European system and the U.S. system.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
As I said, I don't know what your current status is.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you are still a blank sheet, and don't know how to start your Ph.D.,

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think the most important thing is to ask yourself what your motivation is.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It may sound vague.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I won't teach you how to write a document today.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But your motivation will affect how you write your documents.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Even if you are lucky enough to get an interview offer, you will be asked.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If your motivation is not strong enough,

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the interviewer or the person reviewing your document will be able to tell.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In this case, you may be less competitive than other candidates.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you have to ask yourself why you want to apply for a Ph.D.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why do you want to study for a master's degree? Why do you want to study for a Ph.D.?

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why do you want to study abroad?

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
These are all important.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Otherwise, you can stay in Taiwan.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In the field of engineering, you can do very well in Taiwan.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In Taiwan, the Peninsula Institute is very famous.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can finish a master's degree or Ph.D.

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Then you can go to the Peninsula Institute.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can make a lot of money.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So why do you want to study abroad?

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
After studying abroad, what are the requirements?

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
These are the things you have to do.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So at this stage, if you haven't prepared anything,

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the time you need the most is to do some research.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Which school should I study?

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Which university should I study?

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Do I have the opportunity to apply for a Ph.D.?

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
These are the things we can discuss later.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I applied for a Ph.D. in Germany.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I only applied for a Ph.D.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But in principle, it can be applied to most European and EU countries.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In the traditional European system,

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it's a bit like looking for a job.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Our Chinese is called teacher-student system.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you see a professor who has a Ph.D. position,

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
you can write a letter to tell him,

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I saw you applied for a Ph.D. position.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's my background?

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm interested in this topic.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He may ask you to add your resume, motivation, etc.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If he thinks it's OK, he'll say,

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OK, let's have an interview.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
After the conversation, he might say,

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OK, I think you're good. I want to hire you.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tell me when you're coming.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's it.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You and the boss are set.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Another one is the structured Ph.D. program.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You may be familiar with it.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's adapted from English-speaking countries,

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
such as the US, the UK, Australia, or even Taiwan.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a Ph.D. program.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You have to apply to a certain department or Ph.D. program.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It usually has a lot of requirements.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because it's a program,

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it may require you to do lab rotation during your Ph.D.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have to take classes, etc.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You have to meet certain requirements to be able to defend yourself.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But for a teacher-student system,

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you have to go into the lab to do research.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It doesn't require you to take classes, etc.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to graduate.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is the biggest difference

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
between a teacher-student system

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and a structured program.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Most structured programs,

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll talk about it later,

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
besides universities and so-called research institutes,

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
when it provides a structured program,

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it's not unlimited.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Unlike in Taiwan,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
when you graduate, you have to wait for your teacher's approval.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's the same for a teacher-student system.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But in general,

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
for a structured program,

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it usually gives you a 2-3 year contract,

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
up to 1 year.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So for most structured programs,

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the average Ph.D. year is around 4 years.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So how do I start looking for my Ph.D. position?

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I didn't put a website here.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can just type in the title,

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
like Nature Career, Uroxas,

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
or just type in your Ph.D.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's just a website.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Then you can search for your Ph.D. position.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There are a few filter conditions.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It depends on how you want to filter.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Some of these are from the EU.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You might want to go to Germany,

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or the UK, etc.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can filter by yourself.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Nature Career,

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
in terms of reading a Ph.D. in the EU,

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
they see it as a job.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So from Nature Career,

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
you can also see a lot of

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
European Ph.D. positions.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Uroxas,

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is from the EU.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It has a special

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
fellowship.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll talk about it later.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And then there are

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
some other platforms,

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
like Ph.D. Scholarly B.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course,

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
if you know

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
which universities you want to go to,

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you can go to

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
one of the universities

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and find a teacher.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you're interested,

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you can write a letter

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
asking if you're interested

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
in your research,

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and if you want to

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
get a Ph.D.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It'll tell you

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
if you're in the right position.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Or if you want to

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
apply for a program

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
in my lab,

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
it'll tell you if you're

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
in the right network.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Social media,

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
like Facebook,

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Instagram,

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Twitter,

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
a lot of professors

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
have their own Twitter

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
or lab Twitter.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you have a Ph.D.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or post-doc position,

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you can post

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
from there.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I prefer

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
more and more people

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
are using LinkedIn.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a network opportunity.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you have a professor

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and he posts his position,

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you can set a job alert.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can set a keyword

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
like Ph.D. Student,

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ph.D. Scholar,

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
or Ph.D. Researcher.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Your country can be

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Europe or Germany.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It'll tell you

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
which Ph.D. positions

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you can apply for.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's talk about

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
what's special

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
about studying Ph.D.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in Europe.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We usually

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
focus on

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
universities.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But in Europe,

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
universities are more

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
about teaching.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But in Europe,

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
there are a lot of

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
institutes.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A lot of

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
big international companies

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
also have Ph.D. positions.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mentioned

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
some special

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
fellowships in EU.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We'll talk about it later.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't talk about

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
all the institutes

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
in EU.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll talk about

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the four most famous

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
institutes in Germany.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There are also

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
research opportunities

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in some institutes.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll talk about

and Leibniz.

248
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Different colors

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
represent different

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
societies or associations.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There are so many

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
research opportunities

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
in Germany.

1005
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll talk about

1006
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Max Planck,

1007

1010
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'll talk about

1011
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000

1015
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'll talk about

1016
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Max Planck,

1017
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000

and Leibniz.

1020
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'll talk about

1021
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Max Planck,

1022
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000

Fraunhofer,

1024
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and Leibniz.

1025
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
She wants me to leave first

1026
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and then join again.

1027
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll try.

1028
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll try.

1029
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
When I was at the Academy,

1030
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
if you can see

1031
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
in the chat,

1032
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I posted about

1033
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
joining TARA

1034
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and our

1035
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Facebook fan page.

1036
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The latest

1037
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
news is

1038
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
our Linktree.

1039
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
There are a lot of

1040
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
information about TARA.

1041
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Can you see it now?

1042
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Can you see it now?

1043
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes, I can.

1044
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Can you see

1045
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
my presentation slides?

1046
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, I can.

1047
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes, I can.

1048
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Thank you.

1049
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Thank you.

1050
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Today,

1051
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll talk about

1052
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
European Economics.

1053
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I applied for

1054
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
European Economics.

1055
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Compared to

1056
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the previous speaker,

1057
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I think

1058
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
European Economics

1059
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
should be

1060
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
a bit different

1061
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
from the

1062
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
lab environment.

1063
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
lab environment.

1064
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So,

1065
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'll start

1066
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
by introducing myself.

1067
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll start with my background

1068
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so that you can understand

1069
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
what kind of

1070
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
perspective I have

1071
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
when it comes to

1072
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
European Economics.

1073
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'll talk about

1074
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
my preparation

1075
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
for European Economics.

1076
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Then,

1077
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'll talk about

1078
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
how to choose a school

1079
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and my research topic.

1080
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'll also talk about

1081
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
my budget

1082
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and my salary

1083
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in Europe.

1084
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Finally,

1085
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'll talk about

1086
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
my academic background.

1087
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I studied in Taiwan

1088
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
from 2014 to 2018,

1089
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but my master's degree

1090
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
was in Europe.

1091
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
From 2018 to 2019,

1092
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I studied for one year,

1093
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and from 2019 to 2020,

1094
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I studied for two years.

1095
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
From 2021,

1096
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I went to my doctorate

1097
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and started writing my thesis.

1098
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
My research topic

1099
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
is economic development

1100
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and armed conflicts

1101
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
in the United Nations.

1102
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'll talk about my preparation

1103
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for my doctorate.

1104
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You may be curious

1105
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
about how much you need

1106
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
to study to get

1107
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
a doctorate

1108
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
in the field of

1109
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
social science.

1110
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I used to ask

1111
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
some teachers

1112
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
in Taiwan University

1113
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
if I didn't get

1114
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
a doctorate

1115
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
in high-level economics

1116
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
or high-level statistics.

1117
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
In fact,

1118
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it's not so certain.

1119
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It depends on your goal.

1120
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
If you want to

1121
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
study pure theoretical

1122
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
economic theory,

1123
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
high-level economics

1124
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
or high-level statistics

1125
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
are really necessary.

1126
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
However,

1127
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
as long as you can

1128
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
get a doctorate,

1129
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
you won't have

1130
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
too many problems.

1131
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
If you want to

1132
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
study economics,

1133
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
you need to know

1134
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
whether you like

1135
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
individual,

1136
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
general,

1137
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
or economic economics.

1138
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You also need to know

1139
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
whether you need

1140
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
a master's degree

1141
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
in Taiwan,

1142
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
because

1143
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
in the U.S.,

1144
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
there are not so many choices

1145
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
for a master's degree.

1146
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
In the U.S.,

1147
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
a lot of master's degrees

1148
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
are held

1149
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
not for

1150
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
a master's degree,

1151
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but for

1152
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
a master's degree.

1153
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
In the U.S.,

1154
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
a master's degree

1155
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
is given to you

1156
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
as a scholarship.

1157
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
In Chicago,

1158
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
there are some good

1159
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
scholarships,

1160
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
but the tuition

1161
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
is very expensive.

1162
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
In contrast,

1163
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I chose to study

1164
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
a master's degree in Europe

1165
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
because the tuition

1166
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
is relatively cheap.

1167
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
When I studied

1168
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
a master's degree in the Netherlands,

1169
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the tuition was 2000 euros per year.

1170
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
In the U.S.,

1171
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
a master's degree

1172
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
can expand

1173
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
your academic network

1174
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and allow you

1175
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
to adapt to

1176
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
the environment

1177
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
of studying abroad.

1178
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
After two years,

1179
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
you can decide

1180
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
whether you want

1181
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
to apply for a doctor's degree

1182
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in Europe or

1183
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
in the U.S.

1184
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
In my opinion,

1185
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
even if you decide

1186
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
to apply for a doctor's degree

1187
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
in Taiwan,

1188
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000

Erasmus, Tilburg, Mannheim, Munich, Leuven, Brown

1294
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So if you want to apply for a top-30 school in the U.S., there are many schools in Europe that can be compared.

1295
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I think the topic is very different from science and engineering, because we usually write a paper with only one person's name,

1296
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
instead of having a lot of co-authors or a whole lab to complete a project.

1297
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I think the topic is very important for social science students, because sometimes you have to write a research plan yourself,

1298
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and you have to go all the way from the literature review to the research method, and even if you want to do practical evidence, you have to have information, or you have to do interviews, and so on.

1299
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,000
All of these have to be written in great detail, but before you apply for a doctoral program, do you have such a detailed research plan?

1300
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the type of doctoral program you choose.

1301
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:50,000
As I mentioned before, American doctoral programs usually start with a training course, and they say that if you have passed the training course in the first two years, you will start writing your own thesis in the third year.

1302
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
If you want to apply for a U.S. doctoral program, they basically do not require a research plan during the application process.

1303
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
In Europe, it is divided into a similar model in the United States, or you can start writing your thesis directly.

1304
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:14,000
In Europe, the deadline for writing a thesis is usually three to four years, unlike the United States, where you can write it for four or five years.

1305
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So, I think this is quite important. If you come to Europe today and decide to start studying for a doctoral program, I think you should be very clear about your research topic, what kind of topic you have, and whether you can complete this doctoral thesis in the next three to four years.

1306
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So, if you start writing your thesis directly when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program, you usually have to go through the research plan when you apply for a U.S. doctoral program.

1307
00:52:46,000 --> 00:53:02,000
As I mentioned earlier, in Germany and the Netherlands, you are a school employee, and your job title is a PhD researcher.

1308
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:20,000
In Belgium, most of my salary is in contact with HR, but I am not a full-time school employee. What I get is not a job contract, but a scholarship letter.

1309
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So, some benefits are not the same. For example, I don't have a pension, but if you are in the Netherlands, the school will give you a pension, which is like a pension. It should be considered a pension, but I only have social security insurance.

1310
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So, the benefits are not the same, but my benefit is that I don't get paid for my work, so I don't have to be taxed for my salary. But in the Netherlands, your salary will be deducted first.

1311
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:22,000
In terms of economics, the monthly income is about 1,700 to 2,000 euros. If you start writing your thesis first, you will get a scholarship letter, which is about 500 euros per month, and some people get 1,200 euros.

1312
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
In other words, even if you are in the master's program, as long as you save enough money, you don't have to spend too much money on your master's program.

1313
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:43,000
In the Netherlands and Germany, there are more of these methods. In the first two years of your master's program, you have a chance to get a scholarship.

1314
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I think it's important to figure out your source of income, because if you study abroad and spend your youth, you may be 30 years old after studying for 34 years. You don't want to be in debt after studying.

1315
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So if you find that your source of income is a master's program, which is more like a master's program, and every August you have to ask the professor and the HR of the school to confirm that the student's budget can be extended for another year.

1316
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So my scholarship letter is not given once every four years, but it is renewed every year. At first, I was afraid that the teacher would be displeased with me, or I would be lazy, so I decided not to renew it.

1317
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I think this is a tricky point for a master's program. You really have to make sure that the teacher's personality is normal and he is a good person. Otherwise, I have heard that the teacher is unhappy and the master's program can only be terminated for half a year.

1318
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:05,000
My personal experience is that I used to study in the Netherlands and Belgium, and my boyfriend is now studying economics in Germany, and I also applied to a German school.

1319
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I have been talking about Europe and other countries, and now I want to talk about these three countries more clearly.

1320
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:25,000
In the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a one-year or two-year master's program. In Spain, I studied for one year, but why did I study for another two years in the Netherlands?

1321
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Usually, a one-year master's program is not considered to be a program that allows you to write a thesis. It stipulates that you need to have 120 ECTS. You don't have to worry about the points. If you study for two years in Taiwan, you will definitely be able to write a thesis in Europe.

1322
00:56:47,000 --> 00:57:09,000
However, if you study for one year in Europe, most students will want to study for another two years. In the Netherlands, the two-year master's program is generally referred to as a research master's program.

1323
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:34,000
In fact, it is a bit like the UK, where there is a difference between MSc and MPhil. In Germany, the two-year master's program is basically two years. So whether you are studying for MSc or MSc, it is still a two-year course. The first year is a basic course, and the second year you start writing a thesis.

1324
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:52,000
In terms of language, many people will think that I am studying in Europe today. Usually, I am not sure what the literature field is, but at least in economics, all programs and school requirements are based on English.

1325
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:13,000
If you are in the Netherlands, you don't have to worry too much about whether you want to learn Dutch. If you live in the French-speaking area of ​​Belgium or in Germany, I think learning a little language is a good thing, and it is also a leisure other than studying for a master's program. Otherwise, English is basically enough.

1326
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Usually, the language requirements related to social science are relatively high, such as TOEFL and IELTS. However, TOEFL requires at least 100 points, and IELTS requires at least 7 points or more.

1327
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:49,000
In terms of immigration, I think the reason why you want to go to a certain country to study is not only because of the school, but also because you want to plan your entire career. If I graduate, can I stay here to work or even apply for permanent residence?

1328
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I think there is a big point to consider, and that is whether you can get a work contract. I have been in Europe since 2018, but my years are in different countries, so I can't transfer to permanent residence.

1329
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:27,000
For example, I have been studying in Belgium for 4 years, and I have been in Europe for 7 years, so I can't apply for permanent residence, because I am taking a student's scholarship, not a job. However, in the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.

1330
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:45,000
In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved. In the Netherlands, if you take a 2-year master's program, the 2-year master's program counts as 1 year, which is halved.

1331
00:59:45,000 --> 01:00:12,000
In terms of employment opportunities, I think there are more job opportunities in Europe than in Taiwan, because in economics, in the EU, you can often find companies like competition economics or competition consulting, but there are fewer such industries in Taiwan, and most people are still in the financial industry.

1332
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:31,000
For example, some people like social impact, or some areas that are considered not profitable in Taiwan, but I think there are many opportunities in Europe, and this is why I want to come to Europe to study, and even stay here to work in the future.

1333
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:45,000
My application experience goes back to the basics, which is how to apply for a doctorate. The offer I got at that time was one in Germany, one in Belgium, and one in the Netherlands.

1334
01:00:45,000 --> 01:01:04,000
In Germany, it is a 5-year doctorate class, which is a 2-year class plus a 3-year thesis. In the Netherlands, it is also 2 years plus 4 years or 2 years plus 3 years.

1335
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So, if you want to write a letter to the professor, in fact, like in Germany, there was no need to write a letter to the professor in the second half of the Netherlands and the second half of the Netherlands, but in Luwen, where I am now, because it is a master-apprentice relationship, the teacher opened a circle on his website or the school's website and said that I now have a research plan, and I can hire a doctorate student for this plan.

1336
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:50,000
If you are interested in this position, you can write a letter to me with your CV and motivation, and then the teacher will look at the information you sent him and see if he is interested in you.

1337
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So, like this, if you see a job position, you usually start writing your thesis directly. This is the case in both Belgium and Germany, and it is relatively rare in the Netherlands, but it is also the case.

1338
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So, in fact, it's back to Europe, because in the beginning of Europe, they are all master-apprentices, but it's just because economics is more similar to the US training method. It allows you to take two more years of classes before you write your thesis to ensure that the training you receive is of a certain level.

1339
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:47,000
As I said earlier, the entrance requirements of the doctoral class are to find a way to do your own related courses in college, and then if you write your thesis in Taiwan and teach in Taiwan, then basically your own thesis should be able to be presented in English to your future doctoral class.

1340
01:02:47,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The motivation and research plan really depend on what field you want to study. For example, I said at the beginning that I wanted to study economic development because I was also doing economic development in the past, and I was also very interested in this part.

1341
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:24,000
In terms of recommendations, I think it is a very important reason for deciding whether you will go to a certain school, at least in economics.

1342
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Because when I was in Manhattan, my recommendation was a professor when I was studying in Barcelona, and it just so happens that the professor of the Manhattan Graduate Committee was staying in Barcelona before, so he knew those two professors.

1343
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I think that in the academic world, your skill sets are usually so-called soft skills, which means that you may be very good at writing, you may have a lot of ideas, or you may have a lot of research ideas, but these things are not so easy to quantify.

1344
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Because we usually publish a lot of papers when we are not in the undergraduate master's program. These hard-to-quantify skills are actually based on your recommendation and your recommender to help you present.

1345
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.

1346
01:04:31,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So, I think this is also a very important point before taking the undergraduate master's program, which is to really have a network. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you. Even if the teacher is Taiwanese, it doesn't matter, but the teacher should know you.

1347
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:16,000
This is because I just wanted to add that, in fact, what is the standard of living in Europe with 1200 euros of master's scholarships or 2000 euros of doctoral scholarships? I think it is absolutely enough.

1348
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The advantage of living in Europe is that I don't know how to drive, but I think a lot of students who study in the U.S. will not be able to go anywhere if they don't know how to drive.

1349
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But I didn't have time to learn how to drive when I was in Taiwan, so I had to come out and study. But I think in Europe, you don't have to be afraid of driving.

1350
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:57,000
The advantage of living in Europe is that you can buy cheap tickets for Christmas and summer vacation and travel around. So, you don't necessarily have to go to the U.S. to come to Europe. You will also have a good life and a happy doctoral program.

1351
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:06,000
When studying for a doctoral program, I think it is much more important to find a good teacher and the right topic than the school rankings in Europe.

1352
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because every school in Europe has its own specialties, if you only look at the rankings, you may miss out on the fact that there is a teacher here who has published a lot of good papers, and it happens to be your field.

1353
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Then, you need to develop your daily routine and habits. For example, my contract is that I don't even need to teach any books. I don't need to be a TA.

1354
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Sometimes I feel like I'm so free today, and I don't know what to do. But in fact, this flexibility is a good thing, but sometimes it makes you too lazy.

1355
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
In Europe, in addition to reading books, learning languages ​​is also a good hobby.

1356
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm done talking. I think it's about time. Thank you.

1357
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Thank you for sharing. We expect to open Q&A until about 10.50, and then we will start issuing digital participation certificates.

1358
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because there are quite a few people today, so if you want to directly open the microphone to ask questions, please raise your hand first.

1359
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Or you can also type the question in the chat and I will pay attention to it.

1360
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:42,000
If you are still thinking about what questions to ask, when you are preparing for that question, I think you can ask Zhao Yuan to share again.

1361
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:51,000
What is the difference between the United States and Europe when it comes to the field of science and technology?

1362
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Let me share my screen again.

1363
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I forgot to mention that if I talked too fast or if you have any personal questions that are not convenient to ask, you can contact me.

1364
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
My email is haiyongjiancornell. You can also scan the QR code and you can link with me.

1365
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Because the last speaker talked a little bit about stipends and contracts, I will talk about Germany first and then enter the United States.

1366
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
For example, because the speaker has already talked about it, I will talk faster.

1367
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,000
It really depends on the boss. I think if you can get a contract, please get a contract.

1368
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You will get a visa, a work visa, not a student visa.

1369
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
The work visa means that you are the same as most employees.

1370
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
In principle, in Germany, it is a 20-30-day vacation.

1371
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
For our medical school, it is a 30-day vacation.

1372
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Your salary includes tax, pension and medical insurance.

1373
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Please remember that German medical insurance is very expensive.

1374
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So if you want to pay for it yourself, you will have to pay a lot of money from your own pocket.

1375
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And if you are already paying taxes, you have been paying for four years and you have just graduated.

1376
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Then I found out that you are looking for a job, whether it is a postdoc or a medical job, and then the school is over.

1377
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Because you have paid taxes before, and then there is a bit of unemployment in the middle.

1378
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
In fact, you will be paid a unemployment pension because you have no money.

1379
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And a lot of social benefits.

1380
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
In Germany, we are not the so-called tuition fee, we are usually the semester fee.

1381
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Then each class will have different rules, and then for our school, it is 290 euros.

1382
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So if you don't have an economic assessment, I think Germany is a good choice.

1383
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Then we come to the difference between the United States and Germany.

1384
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
In the United States, it is a program system for each school program.

1385
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It has a fixed application deadline every year.

1386
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Suddenly it's winter, and then fall next year.

1387
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Then, in Germany, I just said that there are two systems.

1388
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
There is no certain teacher-student system.

1389
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Then, if the program system, of course, there is an application deadline.

1390
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
However, each program has a different deadline.

1391
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
For example, Envelope and MPI know that they try not to squeeze together.

1392
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So they will miss each other.

1393
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Then in every institute of MPI, their Ph.D. program will not be unified.

1394
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You just saw that every institute is listed in various cities.

1395
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So this is what you have to check on the Internet.

1396
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And the application requirement is that you may need something.

1397
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
As I mentioned earlier, in the United States, you don't have to have a master's degree.

1398
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But in Europe, most of them need a master's degree.

1399
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
In English exam, there is no so-called GRE in Germany.

1400
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It is mainly TOEFL and EAS.

1401
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Even if the time is more than two years, most of them can be accepted.

1402
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
In the United States, there is one more GRE.

1403
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Of course, I know that in recent years, many schools, and the better schools, have actually removed the GRE.

1404
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Because they think, or GMAT, if the social science is GMAT, they will think that this is not necessarily related to research.

1405
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
The resume is a must.

1406
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Here, CV is not a resume.

1407
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
The meaning of CV is that the academic resume is all of it.

1408
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Most of it has no page speed limit.

1409
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You can write it on anything related to academics.

1410
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
In the application document, this will be a little different.

1411
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Because the United States is still used to SOP, Statement of Purpose.

1412
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It is more important to see how your past experience will affect your next PhD, next career, next step.

1413
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
However, if it is in Germany, it is more like so-called lateral motivation.

1414
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Because you have to think about one thing.

1415
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Because the PhD in Germany is relatively short.

1416
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It is three to four years.

1417
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
In addition, you already have a master's degree.

1418
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So you are very clear.

1419
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Including just now, it should be considered that you already know what your research direction goal is.

1420
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So you should talk about your past academic and where your goal is.

1421
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Because I had a background in the past, so I had to find this lab to do this kind of research.

1422
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But in the United States, you still have the so-called first-year course and lab rotation.

1423
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So it cares more about your potential.

1424
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
What did you experience in the past?

1425
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
What will your future development be?

1426
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But you don't have to think too much now.

1427
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Because in principle, when you are applying for a document, a certain program will tell you.

1428
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
He hopes that this document will contain something.

1429
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Recommendation letter, then the United States must be three points can not run away.

1430
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
In Germany, it is two to three points, not necessarily.

1431
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Then there must be a score sheet.

1432
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's just that when you apply, you have to submit it or be accepted.

1433
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Then there is a very interesting one in Germany.

1434
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Because of the education system itself, they also want to provide a high school score sheet.

1435
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
So it's a bit of a hassle.

1436
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
But in order to submit a high school score sheet in English, it took me a little time.

1437
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Then the United States has almost no paper test.

1438
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Then in Germany, there are several.

1439
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
For example, Heidelberg needs to be interviewed.

1440
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Then the Ph.D. system, as I just mentioned, has the so-called teacher-student structure system.

1441
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I just talked about the cost.

1442
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
The cost is really a lot worse.

1443
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Because in the United States, there are some more conservative schools that may be free.

1444
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
For example, the German system is mostly free.

1445
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Up to $100.

1446
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But in principle, all the application fees here in Germany are free.

1447
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And you don't have to send your results from ETS.

1448
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This money may be several years ago.

1449
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It may be higher now, I don't know.

1450
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
But you don't have to send this ETS score sheet in addition.

1451
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
But it's possible that he'll do it for you.

1452
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
He cares a lot about whether your transcript has been recognized.

1453
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
He usually tells you that there will be a uni-assistant in Germany.

1454
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And then he will ask you to sign up.

1455
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
It seems that there are some schools in the United States.

1456
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
But I didn't meet at all when I applied.

1457
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And then, do you need to submit a paper document?

1458
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I think it depends on the program.

1459
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then I mentioned the stipend and salary part.

1460
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Germany has stipend and contract.

1461
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
In the United States, we actually quite agree.

1462
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Because you have to pay your own taxes later.

1463
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Like we're in the US right now.

1464
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
In the United States, you get that money.

1465
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You have to pay your own taxes every year.

1466
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But usually the school will give you your tuition.

1467
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And then you have to pay your own taxes.

1468
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And then it's actually called health insurance.

1469
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Health insurance has to pay for itself.

1470
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I think another great place is Europe.

1471
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
After you were invited, all your expenses.

1472
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I think it's a good thing.

1473
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
After you were invited, all your expenses.

1474
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It turns out that my program was one week.

1475
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And then I was still studying in the United States.

1476
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
When I flew from New York to here, all my expenses.

1477
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Tickets and so on were covered.

1478
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I know that this is getting less and less in the United States.

1479
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Because they want to save a little more money.

1480
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And now Skype interview is very convenient.

1481
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But the European system is still quite a lot.

1482
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
The program will still retain this.

1483
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I think this is quite important.

1484
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And then during your Ph.D.

1485
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
What will happen to you?

1486
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
In Germany, if you are a 15-year-old, you don't have to go to class at all.

1487
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The program may be required to take a little class.

1488
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
That kind of class is not the so-called combined course.

1489
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It may be some scientific practice or something like that.

1490
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
There are some theoretical courses or something like that.

1491
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But in the United States, it's his first year, second year.

1492
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It's like your master, you still have to repair how many credits.

1493
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
In the United States, a lot of times you still have to do lab rotation.

1494
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So you may be in the second year before you decide your lab.

1495
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
But in Germany, in principle,

1496
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You have to decide your boss when you interview.

1497
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And then are you qualified to take the exam?

1498
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
A lot of people in the United States are still qualified to take the exam.

1499
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
But in Germany, you don't.

1500
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You are the professor who has been with people for three or four years.

1501
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And then a lot of programs in the United States require you to be a TA.

1502
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
If you don't want to be a TA,

1503
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
If you don't want to be a TA or just want to focus on research,

1504
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Germany will be more suitable for this.

1505
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
The term of leave is quite different.

1506
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Because like I said, you need a master's degree to apply for a PhD in Germany.

1507
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
In general, his term of leave is relatively short.

1508
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And if you miss the lab rotation, course, etc.

1509
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Of course, you can focus on research and graduate earlier.

1510
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But in the United States, it will be a little longer.

1511
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Flexibility of the project

1512
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Because I know a lot of American words, he's actually the boss.

1513
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I may not be discussing with him.

1514
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
But if you think about it, the so-called master's degree in Germany means

1515
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Or it's like a job.

1516
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It's because of the grant project.

1517
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
He may want you to do that thing.

1518
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So your flexibility may be limited.

1519
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Work-life balance, Europe must be the best.

1520
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's just that you have so many annual leave.

1521
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
In the United States, there may not be.

1522
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And because the United States is longer.

1523
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And then Germany is relatively short.

1524
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So there's a higher chance that you may not have one when you graduate.

1525
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
This may also be something you have to think about.

1526
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
The main comparison is probably here.

1527
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And then maybe you can stop here.

1528
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And then if you have any questions, you can ask the two of us.
