0	10000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech on April 16, 2022.
10000	15000	The speaker we invited today is Jian Muhua.
15000	20000	He graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Atmospheric Engineering.
20000	27000	After graduation, he explored his own interests in Taiwan for a few years, such as running a super marathon.
27000	34000	In 2016, he went to the University of New York to study mathematics.
34000	42000	In 2018, he continued to study at the University of New York's Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology.
42000	53000	His speech today is on the simplification model of hot air and typhoons.
54000	56000	We are looking forward to his speech.
56000	62000	According to TAIRA's tradition, please turn on your microphones.
62000	65000	Let's applaud and welcome Jian Muhua.
73000	76000	Now I will give the floor to Jian Muhua.
76000	77000	Thank you, Shi-An.
77000	81000	I am very happy to be able to come to TAIRA to share my own research.
81000	85000	This is my current research topic.
85000	89000	Because there are some relatively professional parts in the content.
89000	94000	I just saw that many participants are actually people in our field.
94000	99000	So I still maintain the original way of speaking.
99000	105000	If you are interested, we can discuss it later in the message.
105000	106000	I am Jian Muhua.
106000	107000	I am Jian Muhua.
107000	115000	I am a program student at the Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology at the University of New York.
115000	122000	This program mainly deals with atmospheric or ocean topics related to application mathematics.
122000	125000	I will start.
125000	128000	Let me introduce myself.
128000	131000	I am a son of a person.
131000	134000	My mother is also listening.
134000	135000	I recently became a father.
135000	136000	I am a child.
136000	140000	I recently took care of my son in Taiwan.
140000	143000	I also ran a super marathon.
143000	147000	I am also a PhD student at NYU.
147000	151000	I am also engaged in relevant initiatives on Taiwan issues.
151000	153000	I studied at a university in Taiwan.
153000	160000	I also studied at NYU.
160000	164000	I also took part in activities in Taiwan community.
164000	165000	I also took part in our school community meetings.
165000	167000	The following are the activities I have held.
167000	174000	I have been to many of these events.
174000	179000	I will start today's topic.
179000	182000	Today's topic is the atmosphere in the heat wave.
182000	184000	What can we see in the heat wave?
184000	185000	I don't know what to see.
185000	188000	So I found a photo from NASA first.
188000	191000	It is a photo taken from space to the earth.
191000	193000	We can see a lot of clouds.
193000	195000	This is the first thing to see.
195000	200000	The second thing is that we can see a hot air balloon in the photo.
200000	204000	Or everyone thinks this is a typhoon.
204000	208000	I think as an atmospheric researcher,
208000	213000	It is inevitable that we must bring this issue to our living environment.
213000	217000	This is related to climate change.
217000	221000	My question is related to climate change.
221000	227000	How will the heat wave change when the climate changes?
227000	229000	Or what kind of impact will the change have on us?
229000	231000	Because my topic is not about the impact.
231000	233000	So I will talk about what kind of impact it will have.
233000	241000	The emergence of extreme weather events is directly affected by climate change.
241000	244000	For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.
244000	252000	For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.
252000	258000	When the environment changes, the typhoon may become stronger.
258000	263000	In the past few years, we have felt drought or extreme rainfall in Taiwan.
263000	266000	Extreme weather events may increase.
266000	270000	This is my own view.
270000	276000	I think we have studied this topic for a long time.
276000	280000	For example, we have studied this topic for a long time.
280000	284000	But in fact, there are still some uncertainties in understanding this issue.
284000	288000	There are still many uncertainties in forecasting or understanding this matter.
288000	290000	We can give an approximate situation.
290000	297000	Most of these uncertain factors come from the clouds we see in this photo.
297000	301000	That is, the impact of water vapor in the physical system.
301000	305000	So my topic today is actually about water vapor.
305000	309000	If you are in our field, you will know that this is probably the part of atmospheric thermodynamics.
309000	313000	Today is a simple introduction.
313000	320000	Before the next video, I think what I want to say is a bit like this.
320000	324000	We want to know the impact of extreme events on us.
324000	329000	We have to understand our original state first.
329000	332000	Or what is the physical structure behind it?
332000	334000	Or what is the mathematical structure?
334000	336000	We can say how many degrees we have changed today.
336000	340000	How will the climate change?
340000	344000	If you don't have a background knowledge, you know what its original state is.
344000	345000	Or what is the physics behind it?
345000	348000	You can't know what it will become after it changes.
348000	354000	So today's speech will focus on its background state.
354000	358000	Before we start, we know what the background state is.
358000	360000	What is stability? What is instability?
360000	363000	Stability is what we can observe.
363000	367000	We can know what it is without artificial influence.
367000	371000	Or what it is like in the original physical structure.
372000	376000	I found a simple concept on the Internet.
376000	378000	What is stability? What is instability?
378000	380000	First, we can imagine it as a bowl.
380000	382000	There is a ball in the bowl.
382000	386000	When you put the ball in, the ball will roll to the lowest point of the bowl.
386000	389000	How do you move? You push the ball a little bit.
389000	392000	Or you give it a certain range of force.
392000	394000	It won't leave the bottom of the bowl too far.
394000	397000	Then we will call this state stability.
397000	400000	If you put the bowl in the opposite direction,
400000	403000	Or you put the ball on a slope,
403000	405000	The ball will roll to a far place.
405000	409000	Then this situation is not stable.
409000	415000	The third situation is neutral.
415000	416000	It is a neutral state.
416000	418000	The ball can roll anywhere.
418000	422000	It may be relatively stable in any place.
422000	426000	I think what I want to say is that our climate is more inclined to this state.
426000	430000	We have a stable state.
430000	434000	But in the case of climate change, we may become another situation.
434000	436000	It will have a new stability.
436000	440000	Another stability can be more stable.
440000	444000	But this is from point A to point B.
444000	446000	There may be more extreme events.
446000	448000	Or fewer extreme events.
448000	451000	Or a certain extreme event, such as more droughts.
451000	453000	Or there will be more rainfall.
454000	456000	We still need to do more research.
456000	461000	But before all this, we can still understand the stability of state A.
461000	465000	What is the material behind it?
465000	471000	So today's story will probably focus on what our atmosphere is.
471000	475000	Okay, let's start the topic now.
475000	479000	The first point after entering the topic is what we want to talk about.
479000	481000	The first point is buoyancy.
481000	489000	When I was in middle school, buoyancy was a difficult topic.
489000	492000	At that time, the teacher gave a big concept.
492000	494000	That is, buoyancy equals gravity.
494000	495000	What is gravity?
495000	500000	If we see a object floating on an object,
500000	504000	The object floating on the object can hold its weight.
504000	511000	So this buoyancy can hold its weight.
511000	516000	Of course, it can also be said that we can dig out the original fluid.
516000	519000	Then it can replace its weight.
519000	523000	Then it can extend to the second and third layers.
523000	528000	If I have an object sinking in the middle today.
528000	531000	Or it happens to float in this fluid.
531000	536000	Then we know that the density of this thing or the weight of this thing is equal to the weight of the buoyancy.
536000	539000	That is to say, the density of these two things is basically the same.
539000	542000	The next situation is that the density of this thing is relatively large.
542000	544000	Then it will sink to the bottom.
544000	547000	So buoyancy can't support the original weight.
547000	552000	That buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid in this space.
552000	554000	What about the concept of buoyancy?
554000	558000	How do we apply it to the atmosphere?
558000	563000	This is a participant in this experiment.
563000	566000	Come and listen to this speech.
566000	570000	How do we know that the density distribution is in the vertical atmosphere?
570000	576000	Because if we know the density distribution, we know that the object will sink down or float up.
576000	580000	In a direct way, we measure its temperature and air pressure.
580000	584000	We can know that the density of the ideal gas equation.
585000	588000	Of course, we can't measure it at every height.
588000	592000	The simplest way is to close a balloon and let the balloon fly up.
592000	597000	In the process of flying, it will record the temperature and air pressure at each height.
597000	600000	Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
600000	603000	Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
603000	606000	Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
606000	609000	Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
609000	612000	Then we know the density of each layer of air.
612000	615000	We can know the desitny of each layer of air.
615000	618000	Before we do this, we can do another thing.
618000	621000	Before we do this, we can do another thing.
621000	626000	We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.
626000	629000	We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.
629000	630000	It is reduced with height.
630000	637000	However, the pressure is reduced with height.
637000	640000	The pressure is reduced with height.
640000	642000	On the left chart,
642000	643000	On the left chart,
643000	645000	When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.
645000	646000	When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.
646000	647000	More than 1,000 times roaring.
647000	648000	More than 1,000 times roaring.
648000	650000	It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.
650000	651000	It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.
651000	652000	It may be 100 times roaring.
652000	657000	We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.
657000	659000	We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.
659000	662000	This is the anti-intuition thing.
662000	664000	This is the anti-intuition thing.
664000	666000	The temperature is getting lower.
666000	667000	The temperature is getting lower.
667000	671000	However, the density is getting smaller.
671000	673000	The deeper the water water boils,
673000	674000	The deeper the water boils,
674000	675000	The deeper the water boils,
675000	677000	The deeper the water boils,
677000	680000	The larger the temperature,
680000	682000	The larger the temperature of the lower ?
682000	683000	The lower the temperature of the lower channel.
683000	684000	The lower the temperature of the earth's heat,
685000	686000	The lower the river is.
686000	687000	This is an interesting thing.
687000	688000	This is an interesting thing.
688000	692000	The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric
692000	693000	The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric
694000	699000	How do we know that
699000	700000	How do we know that
700000	702000	The stable atmosphere we just thought about
702000	704000	How do we discuss
704000	705000	How do we discuss
708000	711000	We won't be putting balloons in the next page.
711000	712000	We won't be putting balloons in the next page.
712000	714000	To measure this atmosphere,
714000	716000	To measure this atmosphere,
716000	719000	Just use the imagined way
719000	720000	Just use the imagined way
720000	721000	Just use the imagined way
721000	724000	I�e balloons
724000	725000	For example, the height here
725000	726000	For example, the height here
726000	727000	I put a balloon
727000	729000	I move it somewhere else
729000	730000	And see when
730000	731000	I move it somewhere else
731000	732000	When, at a specified height
732000	733000	Will the balloon move up
733000	734000	Or down
734000	735000	And say
735000	736000	And say
736000	739000	Is the atmosphere stable
739000	740000	Is the atmosphere stable
740000	741000	No
741000	742000	No
742000	743000	Is the atmosphere stable
743000	744000	No
744000	745000	Will that be strange
745000	747000	We often have birthday parties
747000	748000	Or sometimes when there's a party
748000	749000	Or sometimes when there's a party
749000	750000	Balloon
750000	751000	It's usually inside
751000	752000	The balloon
752000	755000	It's usually floating in the air
755000	756000	We can put that
756000	757000	Relax
757000	759000	The balloon will float up
759000	760040	That
760040	762000	The process of floating up the balloon
762000	763000	The higher the effect
763000	764000	If we are outdoors
764000	766000	The garlic will explode
766000	768000	Will it break
768000	769000	That's
769000	770000	She just
770000	771000	Have you wondered why
771000	772000	Why
772000	773000	The reason is because
773000	777000	The pressure on the environment changes
777000	778000	After you put the balloon on
778000	779000	That means your balloon
779000	781000	The original air will get more and more
781000	782000	Expansion
782000	783000	After the expansion
783000	784000	The outer layer of yours
784000	785000	No way
785000	786000	Support you
786000	787000	When the pressure
787000	788000	The balloon will explode
788000	789000	That means
789000	790000	We
790000	791000	What I just said
791000	793000	If we move the A balloon to the B balloon
793000	794000	It's not actually
794000	795000	A to B
795000	796000	It's like this
796000	797000	In the process
797000	798000	It will slowly expand
798000	800000	What is the principle of expansion
800000	801000	Oops
801000	802000	The principle of expansion
802000	804000	It's actually the first law of thermodynamics
804000	805000	That is
805000	806000	The first law of thermodynamics
806000	807000	In another idea
807000	809000	Our heating will be equal to the change in temperature
810000	811000	Plus
811000	812000	Uh, plus
812000	814000	Uh, heating is equal to temperature change
814000	815000	If you are a gas
815000	816000	Because it will expand
816000	817000	So
818000	819000	So you have to add
819000	821000	The effect of expansion
822000	823000	Uh
823000	824000	That
824000	825000	The balloon we just talked about
825000	826000	That balloon
826000	827000	It's actually not heated
827000	828000	So in this process
828000	829000	It's actually
830000	833000	The temperature reduction in the process of ascension will be equal to
833000	835000	Uh, the change in pressure
835000	836000	So
836000	837000	Look at this picture on the right
838000	841000	We assume that there is a 25
841000	843000	The balloon of degree C
843000	844000	That balloon
844000	845000	Because it is
845000	846000	Because it is a balloon
846000	848000	So it won't have a quality exchange with the outside world
848000	849000	You won't have
849000	850000	Uh, the air outside runs in
850000	851000	You won't have
851000	852000	The air inside runs out
852000	854000	Then it won't have heat exchange
854000	856000	I won't pass the heat out
856000	857000	Go outside
857000	858000	And the heat outside
858000	859000	Won't pass in
859000	860000	So
860000	861000	This balloon
861000	862000	In the process of rising and falling
862000	863000	In the process of rising
863000	864000	It will
864000	865000	Its temperature will decrease
865000	866000	Its volume will expand
867000	869000	If the balloon moves down above
869000	870000	It is
870000	871000	The balloon will be compressed
871000	872000	Then the volume will shrink
872000	873000	Then the temperature will rise
873000	874000	That
874000	875000	This is a
875000	877000	Is the atmosphere
877000	878000	It's a
878000	881000	Theorem or we use this concept to push us
882000	883000	To understand that
883000	885000	Hey, what is this atmosphere like?
888000	890000	Uh, I just talked about
890000	891000	What I just said is that
891000	893000	Hey, our atmosphere is actually layered
893000	894000	That is, each layer of atmosphere
894000	895000	In fact, it has
895000	896000	It has a temperature
896000	898000	So how do we measure this temperature?
898000	899000	Uh
900000	902000	Uh, is the atmosphere stable?
902000	903000	We
903000	904000	Integrated
905000	906000	Uh, the atmosphere
906000	907000	Assuming it is stable
907000	909000	And then integrate the first law of thermodynamics that we just used
909000	910000	We can actually deduce
910000	913000	A thing called
913000	914000	Uh, it's right here
914000	916000	And this thing on top is
916000	917000	I was given
917000	918000	I was shown to my friends
918000	921000	I was shown to people who were interested in the equation
921000	923000	Then I won't go into the equation room to talk too much
923000	924000	That
924000	926000	Why is this value important?
927000	929000	We can see that it is the middle line
929000	930000	This cloud
930000	931000	He
931000	932000	Oops
933000	934000	He
934000	936000	His concept is that our atmosphere is stable
936000	938000	If it goes up by 1 km
938000	940000	Down 9.8 degrees
940000	941000	That's a bit like saying
941000	943000	If we have a 30 degree C balloon on the surface today
943000	944000	Then this balloon
944000	946000	When we move it to 2000 meters
946000	947000	It will drop 20 degrees
947000	948000	So it's 10 degrees
948000	950000	When it goes up to 4,000 meters
950000	951000	It will drop another 20 degrees
951000	952000	So he is
953000	954000	Negative 10 degrees
954000	955000	That's it
956000	959000	Uh, vertical distribution
959000	960000	That's what we just talked about
960000	962000	The first law of thermodynamics tells us
962000	965000	The result is that in the same process
965000	966000	The balloon
966000	969000	It's going up 2,000 meters, going down 10 degrees, and then it's going to explode
969000	970000	And then it goes down
970000	973000	It will go up another 2,000 meters, it will go down another 20 degrees
973000	974000	And then it will explode again
975000	977000	What about the idea he told us?
977000	978000	That's the other two
978000	980000	That is, uh, if I say
980000	983000	Today's temperature drops slower
983000	986000	For example, this case on the left
986000	988000	It's 30 degrees on the surface
988000	990000	It's 15 degrees at 2,000 meters
990000	992000	That means this case is stable
992000	994000	Because if I put
994000	995000	30 degrees of this
995000	996000	It's the balloon at 30 degrees on the surface
996000	998000	If you move it up 2,000 meters
998000	999000	It will be 10 degrees
999000	1000000	So it will be colder
1000000	1002000	But my environment is
1002000	1003000	Uh, 15 degrees
1003000	1004000	So the colder air
1004000	1005000	Relatively hot air
1005000	1006000	It will sink
1006000	1008000	So the case on the left is stable
1008000	1010000	Because you move 30 degrees to 2,000 meters
1010000	1011000	It will be 10 degrees
1011000	1012000	So the environment is 15 degrees
1012000	1014000	So this air will sink
1014000	1015000	It's relatively stable
1016000	1017000	Then we are more interesting
1017000	1019000	Of course it's the case on the other side
1019000	1021000	It's the temperature it drops
1021000	1022000	It's every 2,000 meters
1022000	1025000	The drop in temperature is more than 20 degrees
1025000	1026000	It's the case on the right
1026000	1028000	It's 30 degrees to 2,000 meters
1028000	1029000	It will drop 25 degrees
1029000	1032000	Then go back to this value reduction rate
1032000	1033000	Just the middle line
1033000	1035000	I found out that this is
1035000	1036000	10 degrees
1036000	1038000	But if I drop 25 degrees
1038000	1040000	It means 25 degrees
1041000	1042000	That is
1042000	1043000	The air I moved up
1043000	1044000	In fact, it is relatively light
1044000	1045000	So it will continue to run up
1045000	1047000	What about this structure
1047000	1049000	It's actually unstable
1049000	1050000	That means
1051000	1053000	Uh, if I
1053000	1054000	Over this value reduction rate
1054000	1056000	It's the temperature that drops more
1056000	1057000	It's unstable
1059000	1061000	Um, let me think about it
1061000	1063000	Uh, here we are
1064000	1066000	It's the idea of stability and instability
1067000	1069000	This idea is in the atmosphere
1069000	1071000	If we only consider dry air
1071000	1073000	It has a dry straight line
1073000	1075000	The one in the middle is my reference state
1075000	1077000	It's a relatively stable state
1077000	1078000	Then you just have to be
1079000	1081000	More stable than reference state
1081000	1082000	It's more stable
1082000	1083000	It's more stable than reference
1083000	1084000	It will be adjusted to
1084000	1085000	It's reference state
1088000	1090000	Let's go to the next page
1090000	1091000	Next page
1091000	1093000	Here is a more common one
1093000	1095000	It's a common concept in the atmosphere
1095000	1096000	It's called temperature
1096000	1097000	It's actually
1097000	1098000	If it's in a more common field
1098000	1099000	In a more common scientific field
1099000	1100000	We will use
1100000	1101000	That's the natural
1102000	1103000	That natural injury
1103000	1104000	But here we don't have to talk about
1104000	1106000	How to reverse injury operation
1106000	1107000	The concept we want to use is
1107000	1108000	If we don't give
1109000	1110000	If we don't heat up our system
1110000	1112000	Then his injury will be stable
1112000	1113000	that
1114000	1116000	We say temperature or injury is stable
1116000	1118000	Uh, conservative
1119000	1120000	In fact, it means
1120000	1121000	Hey, we didn't heat it up
1121000	1122000	No quality exchange
1122000	1123000	In fact, it is conservative
1124000	1126000	Then you can go back to the picture of that page
1126000	1128000	Just the picture of that page
1128000	1130000	After we calculate its temperature
1130000	1132000	In fact, you can get a
1132000	1134000	A simpler concept is
1134000	1135000	If my temperature
1135000	1136000	On each vertical layer
1136000	1137000	It's all
1137000	1138000	If it's a constant
1138000	1140000	Then the air on this layer is stable
1140000	1142000	It's neutral
1142000	1143000	It's neutral
1143000	1144000	Then if its
1144000	1146000	Temperature increases with height
1146000	1147000	For example, the one on the left
1147000	1149000	It was 30 degrees, 15 degrees and negative 5
1149000	1151000	It is 303 308
1151000	1152000	And 313
1152000	1154000	Its absolute temperature increases with the water
1154000	1156000	It means that this layer is stable
1157000	1159000	That's the other side
1159000	1160000	It's on the right
1160000	1162000	Its temperature decreases with height
1162000	1163000	That's not stable
1164000	1165000	Okay, this one
1165000	1166000	This is a
1166000	1167000	It's kind of a good idea
1167000	1168000	We can know right away
1168000	1169000	that
1169000	1170000	The atmosphere is
1171000	1172000	That is, if we know its temperature
1172000	1173000	We can know right away
1173000	1175000	That is, if we know its temperature
1175000	1176000	We can know right away
1176000	1178000	The whole thing is stable or not
1178000	1179000	That
1179000	1180000	We are in
1180000	1182000	In everyday life
1182000	1184000	Or when we just observed the balloon
1184000	1185000	We just know
1185000	1187000	We're going to convert it back to its temperature
1187000	1188000	Most of the time
1189000	1190000	The air is stable
1190000	1191000	Because it's all
1191000	1193000	It's the middle or the left side of this case
1193000	1194000	Because if it's unstable
1194000	1196000	It will have a flow and then let
1196000	1198000	The hot air goes up and the cold air comes down
1198000	1199000	Then it will go back to
1200000	1201000	Stable state
1201000	1202000	This is a bit like
1203000	1204000	As long as
1204000	1205000	As long as we have bad guys
1205000	1206000	Then the bad guys will be
1206000	1207000	Be
1207000	1209000	Everyone is trained to be a better person
1209000	1210000	In this way, in the end
1210000	1211000	In our environment
1211000	1212000	You'll see more
1212000	1213000	It's all stable
1213000	1214000	This state
1214000	1215000	it is good
1216000	1217000	it is good
1217000	1218000	Wait a minute
1218000	1219000	Yeah, this one
1219000	1220000	I want to ask a question
1220000	1221000	I want to ask a question
1221000	1222000	Okay, I think I think
1222000	1223000	I think this is a good one
1223000	1224000	I think this is a good one
1224000	1225000	That cutting point is
1225000	1226000	If you have any questions here
1226000	1227000	If you have any questions here
1227000	1228000	I think we can
1228000	1229000	Pause
1229000	1230000	Pause
1230000	1231000	Okay, I'm just asking a very
1231000	1232000	Okay, I'm just asking a very
1232000	1233000	It should be
1233000	1234000	This is the professional field
1234000	1235000	I think it's a boring question
1235000	1238000	This is the 303 you talked about
1238000	1239000	308 313k
1239000	1240000	This is SETA
1240000	1242000	This is SETA
1242000	1244000	OK
1244000	1245000	Sorry
1245000	1246000	This is the so-called temperature, right?
1246000	1248000	Yes, it is the so-called temperature
1248000	1249000	But actually we are in
1249000	1250000	This is what we often use in the field
1250000	1251000	Using kelvin
1251000	1253000	Use absolute temperature to express
1253000	1254000	This why I use absolute temperature
1254000	1255000	The reason is because
1255000	1257000	It can be different from the temperature
1258000	1259000	Such
1259000	1260000	Yes
1260000	1261000	Its unit is
1261000	1262000	Use
1262000	1263000	Yes
1263000	1266000	Use temperature to express temperature
1266000	1269000	OK
1269000	1270000	it is good
1270000	1271000	Just up
1271000	1273000	Just up to this point
1273000	1275000	The concept is that it is
1275000	1276000	Uh
1276000	1278000	It's not
1278000	1281000	It's not water
1281000	1282000	it is good
1282000	1283000	After the water is involved
1283000	1285000	The problem will become more complicated
1285000	1286000	Then we can know that
1286000	1287000	In the balloon just now
1287000	1288000	If we catch it now
1288000	1290000	In the air of the earth
1290000	1292000	It will have gas oxygen carbon dioxide
1292000	1294000	Then it will also have water
1294000	1295000	That's why
1295000	1296000	For example, people living in the United States
1296000	1298000	It will feel that the air is dry
1298000	1299000	Because its water may be less
1299000	1300000	People in Taiwan
1300000	1301000	I feel that there is more water
1301000	1302000	Is the abundance of water
1302000	1305000	In fact, in addition to affecting the comfort of our life
1305000	1306000	In addition
1306000	1308000	It will also affect the stability of the atmosphere
1309000	1310000	The picture on the right
1310000	1311000	It was also caught by me in Wikipedia
1311000	1313000	This thing is
1313000	1315000	This story is like this
1315000	1316000	Uh
1316000	1318000	We are in the process of atmospheric vertical movement
1318000	1319000	In the process of atmospheric vertical movement
1319000	1320000	The temperature will be
1320000	1321000	The temperature will be reduced
1321000	1323000	In the process of temperature reduction
1323000	1325000	He will encounter a situation
1325000	1327000	The temperature is low
1327000	1329000	The water will freeze
1329000	1331000	It's a bit like we're in the air
1331000	1333000	It's a bit like the state of fog
1333000	1334000	that is
1334000	1336000	If the air cools down quickly
1336000	1338000	That water
1338000	1339000	Uh
1339000	1341000	The water is the water
1341000	1343000	The frozen water pressure is on the right
1343000	1344000	Will
1344000	1345000	Will
1345000	1347000	Will let the steam
1348000	1349000	Become
1349000	1350000	Atmospheric water
1350000	1351000	That process
1351000	1352000	Uh he
1352000	1353000	He is not linear
1353000	1356000	He needs a more complicated formula to calculate
1357000	1359000	Then this process is actually more
1359000	1360000	It's more difficult to capture
1360000	1362000	It's more difficult to understand
1362000	1363000	That's it
1364000	1366000	So when we think about water
1366000	1367000	Just mentioned earlier
1367000	1369000	The process of stability
1369000	1370000	There is a new one
1371000	1372000	There is a new interpretation
1373000	1375000	That is, when water becomes steam
1375000	1376000	When it becomes steam
1376000	1377000	It will release some heat
1377000	1379000	What about the first law of thermodynamics we just learned
1379000	1380000	There will be one
1381000	1382000	There will be a heating on our right
1382000	1383000	On the right
1383000	1386000	So our up and down adjustment process
1386000	1387000	Also add
1387000	1390000	The adjustment of the heat of the water
1390000	1392000	Then we can get another one
1392000	1394000	It's the ratio of cooling
1394000	1396000	It's the ratio of cooling when there's water
1396000	1398000	He usually calls us this
1398000	1400000	It's called visual heat reduction rate
1400000	1401000	That is, you can imagine that he is
1402000	1405000	Moisture lapse rate
1405000	1406000	When there is water
1406000	1407000	We have another cooling rate
1407000	1409000	Then his cooling rate is more
1410000	1411000	Smaller
1411000	1412000	It's just dry
1412000	1414000	It drops by 9.8 degrees per kilometer
1414000	1415000	But when you have water
1415000	1417000	It only drops by about 6 degrees per kilometer
1417000	1419000	Then there is a thing here
1419000	1420000	Just a little reminder
1420000	1422000	Uh 9.8
1422000	1423000	Just that 9.8 degrees
1423000	1425000	Because the formula he calculated is a constant
1425000	1426000	So
1426000	1427000	Uh
1427000	1429000	It won't change with the height
1429000	1430000	That visual heat reduction rate
1430000	1432000	This 6.5 is a estimate value
1432000	1434000	It's a non-linear value
1434000	1436000	So you can think about this company is so complicated
1437000	1439000	Then it will change with the height
1439000	1441000	So 6.5 is a kind of estimate value
1441000	1442000	Then follow
1442000	1443000	With different heights
1443000	1444000	It has different
1444000	1445000	The gradient
1445000	1446000	Then in the process
1446000	1448000	We can at the same time
1448000	1449000	Define another temperature
1449000	1450000	Is related to
1451000	1452000	Water
1453000	1455000	This temperature is called
1455000	1456000	Uh, relative temperature
1456000	1457000	Relative temperature
1457000	1459000	Relative temperature is also
1459000	1460000	You can think of it as a wet temperature
1460000	1462000	After adding water vapor
1462000	1463000	He can get the result
1463000	1464000	That
1464000	1466000	Because the water vapor is really complicated
1466000	1467000	Then we can see that
1467000	1468000	It's wet
1468000	1470000	The relative temperature equation is here
1470000	1471000	Then I don't have to explain
1471000	1472000	What's in it
1472000	1473000	But he
1473000	1474000	It is a fairly complicated value
1475000	1476000	Very complicated calculation
1476000	1477000	But if we calculate
1477000	1478000	After this relative temperature value
1478000	1479000	He actually
1479000	1481000	The concept of application will be quite simple
1482000	1483000	it is good
1484000	1485000	it is good
1486000	1487000	Then
1487000	1488000	Next we want to introduce
1488000	1489000	Is that we want to introduce
1489000	1490000	When there is water vapor
1490000	1491000	The atmosphere will have a
1491000	1492000	Another state occurs
1492000	1493000	It is called
1493000	1494000	Unstable condition
1495000	1496000	That
1496000	1497000	Uh, what about this picture
1497000	1498000	If we don't look
1499000	1501000	Don't look at this part of the unstable condition
1501000	1502000	Just look at this
1502000	1505000	The part of the dry heat dissipation rate
1505000	1506000	We can go back to just
1506000	1507000	Just review
1507000	1508000	The result we just got
1508000	1509000	If our cooling rate
1509000	1511000	Uh, this gamma is its cooling rate
1511000	1512000	must
1513000	1514000	that is
1514000	1515000	This symbol is upside down
1515000	1516000	That is, we are lower than the temperature
1516000	1518000	If the temperature of the dry heat dissipation rate is more than
1518000	1520000	Or if our temperature is
1520000	1522000	If the water level is low, this
1524000	1525000	This is our atmosphere
1525000	1526000	Unstable
1526000	1527000	Then what if
1527000	1528000	Uh, the other condition is
1528000	1529000	If our atmosphere is
1529000	1530000	More than this
1530000	1531000	If the cooling rate is lower
1531000	1532000	It is stable
1532000	1533000	So on the other side
1533000	1534000	Relatively stable
1535000	1536000	Uh, this side
1536000	1537000	it is good
1537000	1538000	But when we have water vapor
1538000	1539000	After considering
1539000	1540000	What about
1540000	1541000	What about
1541000	1542000	We have another condition
1542000	1543000	Unstable occurrence
1543000	1544000	The situation in the unstable condition is
1544000	1546000	Uh, it's in the cooling rate
1546000	1547000	It's in
1547000	1548000	Uh, let me see
1548000	1550000	It's in the middle of negative 9.8 to negative 6.5
1551000	1552000	Because there's a negative sign here
1552000	1553000	So it's
1553000	1554000	I'm easy to get this wrong
1554000	1555000	I was right
1555000	1556000	I just
1556000	1557000	Ten minutes before the start
1557000	1558000	Ten minutes to change the first film
1558000	1559000	I changed it wrong
1559000	1560000	So here's a condition
1560000	1561000	The unstable situation is
1561000	1562000	In the middle
1562000	1563000	Its atmosphere is actually
1563000	1564000	Unstable
1564000	1565000	Then it will adjust to
1566000	1567000	To this stability
1567000	1568000	That is to say
1568000	1569000	If it has water vapor
1569000	1570000	Or if it has
1571000	1572000	If it has water vapor
1572000	1573000	It will be
1573000	1574000	Unstable conditions
1574000	1575000	It will produce flow
1575000	1577000	What about the formula for its judgment
1577000	1578000	In fact, you can see
1578000	1579000	Imagine that it is the temperature
1579000	1580000	Is increasing with the height
1580000	1581000	But its
1581000	1583000	Relatively low temperature is decreasing with the height
1583000	1584000	That's the case
1584000	1585000	In fact, it meets
1585000	1586000	Unstable
1586000	1587000	The conditions
1587000	1588000	Uh
1590000	1591000	Uh, good
1591000	1592000	I'm going to
1592000	1593000	I'm going to
1593000	1594000	I'm going to
1594000	1595000	I'm going to
1595000	1596000	I'm going to
1596000	1597000	I'm going to
1597000	1599000	I'm not sure if this is a very complicated
1600000	1601000	The idea
1601000	1602000	But we go to the next page
1602000	1605000	This idea will be relatively useful
1605000	1607000	Ok, now we finally have to see
1607000	1609000	What is the heat generation
1609000	1611000	What about the heat generation
1611000	1612000	Uh
1613000	1614000	Its situation is
1614000	1616000	If we are on a ocean
1616000	1618000	This ocean will absorb radiation from the sun
1618000	1620000	And then it will heat our surface
1620000	1622000	And then there's another thing
1622000	1623000	When a object has temperature
1623000	1625000	It will have long-wave radiation
1625000	1626000	A lot of radiation
1626000	1627000	The radiation goes out
1627000	1628000	Will send the heat out
1628000	1629000	So it will produce a
1629000	1630000	Is
1631000	1632000	System
1632000	1634000	Then there will be heat coming in and heat going out
1634000	1635000	And then
1635000	1637000	Uh, we only rely on radiation
1637000	1639000	Its heat cannot be adjusted to a stable state
1639000	1641000	So it will have a flow to help
1641000	1643000	The whole atmosphere is adjusted
1644000	1645000	That's our
1645000	1647000	Uh, the story
1647000	1648000	Simplified, simplified, simplified version
1648000	1649000	Of course, in the atmosphere
1649000	1650000	It will have
1650000	1651000	The difference in the ocean
1651000	1653000	And then it will have different
1653000	1654000	Uh, background
1654000	1655000	Atmospheric circulation
1655000	1656000	And then it will have
1656000	1658000	Maybe there are a lot of people doing air glue
1658000	1660000	Uh, there will be different physical phenomena
1660000	1662000	Will affect
1663000	1665000	It's the change of the heat generation
1665000	1667000	But what I'm talking about here is a bit like his
1667000	1669000	Is that you can do everything
1669000	1671000	Ignore the parts that can be ignored
1671000	1673000	What you can get is
1673000	1674000	This system I just talked about
1675000	1676000	That right
1676000	1679000	This is a picture from the textbook
1679000	1681000	What it describes is
1681000	1683000	Its y-axis is the height
1683000	1686000	Then its x-axis is from 90 degrees south to 90 degrees north
1686000	1687000	So it's a
1687000	1689000	Uh, I put every
1689000	1692000	The upper temperature of the latitude is
1692000	1693000	Average value
1694000	1695000	So this is the latitude above
1695000	1696000	Then the following is the latitude
1696000	1698000	Then we can see the latitude value
1698000	1700000	It's just that it's not very clear
1700000	1701000	But its latitude
1701000	1703000	In fact, it is increased by the height of the water, so it means that
1703000	1705000	We are in the channel or in the heat generation atmosphere
1705000	1707000	The temperature is increased by the height of the water
1707000	1708000	Which
1708000	1710000	Uh, in line with what we just saw
1710000	1711000	This condition
1711000	1713000	The temperature is increased by the height of the water
1713000	1715000	What about the following picture
1715000	1717000	Is quite low temperature
1717000	1719000	Then we can see that in the heat generation area
1719000	1721000	In fact, it's all the same value
1721000	1722000	It means
1724000	1726000	In the heat generation atmosphere
1726000	1728000	Its relative temperature is actually
1728000	1731000	A constant is a constant with the height
1731000	1733000	That means most of the time it is maintained
1733000	1736000	In a state that has just been adjusted
1736000	1738000	Or it's a neutral state
1738000	1740000	There must be a process
1740000	1741000	In the process is
1741000	1744000	Uh, solar heating or other non-thermal processes
1744000	1745000	Put
1746000	1748000	This atmosphere becomes unstable
1748000	1750000	Then it is adjusted by the flow
1750000	1751000	Stable
1751000	1752000	Then this picture tells us that in fact
1752000	1753000	This flow is in
1753000	1755000	It is very common in the heat generation atmosphere
1755000	1757000	It's just that it's a very common phenomenon
1757000	1759000	That's why
1759000	1762000	My research is to study the process of wet flow
1763000	1765000	How is it
1766000	1767000	it is good
1767000	1769000	The next page is
1769000	1771000	Uh, this page is
1771000	1773000	I call it magic step
1773000	1774000	Just
1774000	1776000	Uh, we want to understand this system
1776000	1778000	But the atmosphere system is actually very complicated
1778000	1779000	I just said
1779000	1781000	If you want to consider everything
1781000	1783000	You want to consider
1783000	1785000	You want to consider
1785000	1788000	Uh, water, you want to consider B, you want to consider rain, you want to consider radiation
1788000	1790000	All this process you will
1790000	1792000	You will write out a super complicated
1792000	1794000	Mathematical model
1794000	1795000	Then you will
1795000	1799000	A super complicated fluid model, you have to consider the density, you have to consider all kinds of changes
1799000	1801000	But I actually went back to it
1802000	1804000	I'm in the traditional flow problem
1804000	1805000	Plus
1805000	1808000	A simplified state equation
1808000	1810000	To describe that if today
1810000	1811000	Produce
1811000	1813000	When it is saturated
1813000	1815000	How will its heat release change?
1815000	1816000	This simple equation
1816000	1819000	Replaced by a very complicated thermal equation
1819000	1820000	Or replaced by a very complicated
1820000	1823000	The process of microphysis is to simplify everything
1823000	1824000	Simplify to me
1824000	1826000	It's only saturated and then it's unstable
1826000	1827000	In this state
1827000	1828000	To write out
1828000	1829000	This equation
1829000	1830000	Give
1830000	1831000	Give
1831000	1833000	It's just a little bit more information
1833000	1835000	This time it's not a fluid
1835000	1837000	It's just that it's simplified like this
1837000	1838000	Then it is driven by buoyancy
1838000	1839000	The whole system
1839000	1840000	Then we
1841000	1842000	Uh, this
1842000	1848000	This, this is to use the temperature and the relative temperature to adjust its buoyancy
1848000	1849000	That
1849000	1850000	That's not it
1850000	1851000	This is not
1851000	1853000	This is not the original form in my original paper
1853000	1855000	But it's very close
1855000	1857000	We can look at that form
1857000	1858000	Then he also
1858000	1860000	For super super good people in thermodynamics
1860000	1861000	This is not a very exact
1861000	1862000	This is not
1862000	1864000	A very exact equation
1864000	1865000	and so
1866000	1868000	If you need more details
1868000	1869000	That's what we'll discuss later
1869000	1871000	Then why can we do this
1871000	1873000	Why can we do this equation
1873000	1874000	Can help us understand
1874000	1875000	It should be said
1875000	1877000	Or what kind of simplification did I do?
1877000	1878000	That's what we just said
1878000	1879000	The atmosphere is actually on the ocean
1879000	1881000	Then he has the top of the fluid
1881000	1882000	Then he is
1882000	1883000	There is no lid on the top of the fluid
1883000	1885000	But I put the fluid in two lids
1885000	1886000	Oops
1887000	1888000	Put it in two lids
1888000	1889000	Then I add
1890000	1891000	Plus the process of condensation
1891000	1893000	Then I add the unstable
1893000	1895000	This fluid
1895000	1896000	Unstable conditions
1896000	1897000	This condition is not a condition
1897000	1898000	Unstable condition
1898000	1899000	This state
1900000	1902000	I gave him a relatively low temperature
1902000	1903000	Then he is
1903000	1904000	The low temperature is greater than zero
1904000	1905000	Give him this condition
1905000	1907000	Then if it meets some conditions
1907000	1908000	It will produce
1908000	1910000	That is, it will be saturated and release heat
1911000	1912000	Simply put
1913000	1915000	Inside my model
1915000	1917000	If it is saturated, it will go
1917000	1919000	Its buoyancy is determined by its relative low temperature
1919000	1920000	So it is unstable
1920000	1922000	If I say my model
1922000	1923000	I judge it is
1924000	1925000	It is stable without saturation
1925000	1926000	So this
1926000	1927000	To some extent
1927000	1929000	It meets the condition of instability
1929000	1930000	This state is
1931000	1932000	Stable without saturation
1932000	1933000	Stable with saturation
1933000	1934000	Then this
1934000	1936000	What about such a fluid
1936000	1937000	In fact, it will
1938000	1939000	It needs a distribution
1939000	1940000	It won't be a
1940000	1941000	It's me today
1941000	1942000	Just pull a balloon up
1942000	1943000	I know that there is saturation here
1943000	1944000	There is no saturation here
1944000	1945000	It will be a
1945000	1946000	It is
1946000	1947000	It will be a
1948000	1949000	Distribution
1949000	1950000	Some places have flow
1950000	1951000	Some places have no flow
1951000	1952000	It is going down
1952000	1953000	Some places are going up
1953000	1955000	Then there is an animation on the bottom page
1955000	1956000	This is my simulation animation
1956000	1958000	Then I think this animation can give you some
1958000	1960000	The idea is to know
1960000	1961000	What is this flow
1961000	1962000	That's the same as if
1962000	1964000	This is the same as what we know
1964000	1965000	The atmosphere model is quite similar
1965000	1966000	Or if it is
1966000	1967000	A little bit like the weather phenomenon we know
1967000	1968000	At the beginning I gave some
1968000	1970000	Just random perturbation
1971000	1973000	Then after a while
1973000	1974000	It will have a flow
1974000	1975000	In this process
1975000	1976000	By the way, let me describe
1976000	1977000	What is my model
1978000	1979000	This is my
1979000	1981000	The equation above me just now
1981000	1982000	Is to use
1983000	1985000	Uncompressible package
1985000	1987000	Uncompressible program to
1987000	1988000	Solve the above equation
1988000	1989000	Then this
1989000	1991000	The program is
1992000	1993000	Can have
1993000	1994000	Is adaptive mesh
1994000	1996000	I'm not sure what to say
1996000	1997000	It can be mesh
1997000	1998000	Detailed to
1998000	2000000	Can have dynamic mesh
2000000	2001000	Then it is in
2002000	2005000	Ccse developed by Perkin Lab
2005000	2006000	Then if
2006000	2008000	For those of you who have studied the numerical method
2008000	2011000	It is the numerical method of
2011000	2012000	The
2012000	2013000	Then
2013000	2014000	Solve
2015000	2017000	Under the condition that it is uncompressible
2017000	2019000	We use approximate projection
2019000	2021000	Is to use a method to solve
2021000	2022000	Just
2023000	2025000	Solve this limitation of uncompressible flow
2025000	2026000	Then we can see
2026000	2027000	This is the addition of rotation
2027000	2028000	So
2029000	2031000	So after a while
2031000	2032000	Numerical simulation
2032000	2034000	Then the random flow we just talked about
2034000	2035000	Will become
2035000	2037000	It's like a typhoon
2037000	2038000	This kind of spiral
2038000	2039000	What about this spiral
2039000	2040000	In fact, it is
2040000	2042000	There are many similar places to typhoons
2044000	2045000	Then it will
2045000	2046000	It will also die
2046000	2048000	Then it will grow a new flow
2049000	2050000	Then it has
2050000	2051000	Is that it has an upper and lower layer
2051000	2053000	We can talk about the upper layer area
2053000	2055000	The upper layer area is the typhoon
2055000	2057000	That lower layer area is
2057000	2059000	It's just that there is no water here
2059000	2060000	The place is its lower layer area
2060000	2061000	That
2061000	2063000	This simplified model
2063000	2065000	I'm not sure if I can convince everyone
2065000	2067000	It is to some extent
2067000	2070000	Captured a lot of atmospheric features
2071000	2072000	That
2072000	2073000	We use
2073000	2075000	To understand this simplified model
2075000	2076000	To understand that
2077000	2078000	The original atmosphere
2078000	2080000	Or what is the atmosphere
2080000	2081000	Come
2081000	2083000	Come and do further research
2083000	2084000	That
2086000	2087000	Let's go to the next page
2087000	2089000	I haven't jumped to the next page yet
2089000	2091000	Then we have some more
2091000	2092000	Simple
2092000	2093000	It should be said that it is not simple
2093000	2094000	Anyway, it is more
2094000	2095000	Uh
2095000	2097000	A more static picture to see
2098000	2100000	Look at what my simulation results tell us
2100000	2101000	Or
2101000	2102000	What are these things
2102000	2103000	Is related to atmospheric
2103000	2104000	Similar
2105000	2106000	That
2106000	2108000	The two on the left are
2108000	2109000	Uh
2109000	2110000	A time screenshot
2110000	2111000	That left
2111000	2112000	Uh
2112000	2114000	What about this A picture
2114000	2116000	It is not
2116000	2118000	No rotation
2118000	2120000	The right one has rotation
2120000	2121000	Then we can see that there is no rotation
2121000	2122000	It will have
2122000	2123000	Is the ascending area
2123000	2125000	There are some currents in
2125000	2126000	In
2126000	2127000	In
2127000	2129000	Inside my simulation area
2129000	2130000	Then there is another place
2130000	2131000	Is the descent area
2131000	2132000	This way
2133000	2134000	Then the other side of the picture is
2134000	2136000	I put the rotation into my
2136000	2137000	In the simulation conditions
2137000	2139000	It will produce a vortex like a typhoon
2139000	2140000	Good
2140000	2141000	You will see a few
2141000	2142000	Several such
2142000	2143000	Vortex
2143000	2145000	Okay, then I put these vortexes
2145000	2146000	Go to the mirror
2146000	2147000	Is to do
2147000	2148000	Along its
2149000	2150000	Half into the average
2150000	2152000	We can see a lot
2152000	2153000	Some features like typhoons
2154000	2155000	Let's take a look at the above
2155000	2156000	This picture
2156000	2157000	It is
2158000	2159000	It is
2159000	2161000	The color is the vertical speed
2161000	2162000	So it will have
2162000	2164000	The speed of the center rise
2164000	2165000	It will also have
2165000	2166000	There is a descent in the center
2166000	2167000	It's a bit like a typhoon
2167000	2168000	Typhoon eye
2168000	2169000	The other one
2169000	2170000	Is contour
2170000	2171000	Its horizontal line
2171000	2172000	Is
2172000	2173000	The content of liquid water
2174000	2175000	So it rises in the center
2175000	2177000	There are more liquid water
2177000	2179000	So this is like us
2181000	2182000	I don't understand typhoons
2182000	2183000	We have also seen the satellite image of typhoons
2183000	2184000	Is in the center of the typhoon
2184000	2185000	There will be a lot of clouds
2185000	2186000	There will be a lot of water and a lot of rain
2186000	2187000	So this is to some extent
2189000	2191000	Close to our understanding of typhoons
2191000	2192000	What about the next one
2192000	2193000	Is
2193000	2194000	Uh, it's a typhoon
2194000	2195000	Mirror wind and oblique wind
2195000	2196000	Is
2196000	2197000	There is a lower layer
2197000	2198000	That
2198000	2199000	The color is the mirror wind
2199000	2200000	It has
2200000	2201000	The lower layer is from the outside
2201000	2202000	Into the typhoon center
2203000	2204000	The wind
2204000	2206000	Then it will decrease with the height
2206000	2208000	It will fly out from the upper layer
2208000	2209000	The upper layer flows out
2209000	2210000	Then this is accompanied by
2212000	2213000	Is the oblique wind
2213000	2214000	That this
2214000	2215000	In the atmosphere
2215000	2216000	It meets some
2217000	2218000	Uh, what is this
2219000	2220000	Is the slope wind
2221000	2222000	The slope wind
2223000	2224000	What is the slope wind
2224000	2225000	Is the slope wind
2225000	2226000	The
2226000	2227000	The
2227000	2228000	The model is like this
2228000	2229000	What about the third picture
2229000	2230000	It is
2231000	2232000	Uh, it's quite unsteady
2232000	2233000	With its angular momentum
2233000	2234000	That in
2234000	2236000	There is a famous paper in the atmosphere
2236000	2238000	It has a narrative
2238000	2239000	Say it is
2241000	2242000	A narrative
2242000	2243000	Uh, an ideal spiral
2243000	2244000	Its angular momentum
2244000	2245000	With its relative unsteady
2246000	2247000	To some extent
2247000	2248000	Just his
2249000	2250000	The line must be relatively parallel
2250000	2251000	That
2251000	2252000	In this result
2252000	2253000	In this part
2253000	2254000	It is also relatively parallel
2254000	2255000	So it means that this spiral
2255000	2256000	It is with
2257000	2260000	It is quite similar to the ideal typhoon model
2260000	2261000	it is good
2262000	2263000	it is good
2263000	2265000	This is the last picture with information
2265000	2267000	This picture is also a little bit complicated
2267000	2268000	But
2268000	2270000	Uh, I think the reason I want to show this picture is because
2272000	2274000	Because we talked about so much in the front
2274000	2276000	Wei Wen talked so much about injury
2276000	2278000	That this picture is actually the concept of application injury
2278000	2280000	To divide my level
2280000	2282000	That is, I put the injury of each level
2283000	2285000	Every block of different injuries
2285000	2286000	Collected
2286000	2287000	Then go and say
2287000	2288000	My
2288000	2290000	The atmosphere of my different injuries
2290000	2292000	In the end, the blocks of different injuries
2292000	2294000	How is it distributed
2294000	2296000	Okay, what about this one above?
2296000	2298000	The above one is
2298000	2300000	Uh, its distribution
2300000	2302000	There is a white line here
2302000	2304000	If you can see it, it is
2304000	2305000	It is
2306000	2307000	Uh, the condensation line
2307000	2308000	That is, if I am in
2309000	2311000	The upper right of this line represents these air
2311000	2312000	Is condensed
2312000	2313000	These blocks are condensed
2313000	2315000	Then there is no condensation below
2315000	2317000	Then we can find out
2317000	2318000	In
2318000	2319000	If there is no rotation
2319000	2320000	Inside the case is
2320000	2321000	Uh, this
2321000	2322000	This kind of
2322000	2323000	Under this state
2323000	2324000	Most of it
2324000	2326000	The air is not condensed
2326000	2327000	Then there will be a small part of it
2328000	2329000	Is condensed
2330000	2332000	Uh, the condensed air is relatively small
2332000	2333000	Then
2333000	2335000	In addition, if there is a spiral
2335000	2336000	It has more
2336000	2337000	Less proportion
2337000	2338000	There will be an upward spiral
2338000	2340000	Then there are more parts of the lower layer
2340000	2341000	So its upper layer
2341000	2343000	The upper and lower layers are more open
2344000	2346000	This is the lower layer area
2346000	2347000	Then this is the upper layer area
2348000	2349000	Then there is no
2349000	2351000	The upper layer area without rotation is here
2352000	2353000	So its upper and lower
2353000	2356000	The upper and lower areas can be separated
2356000	2357000	Then below this is a
2358000	2359000	In uh
2360000	2362000	A fairly low temperature
2362000	2365000	It can distinguish its upper and lower
2365000	2366000	What is it like in a vertical movement
2367000	2368000	that
2368000	2369000	Uh, when there is a rotation
2369000	2370000	His upper body is
2370000	2371000	More will not be
2372000	2373000	Uh environment to
2373000	2375000	Mix is if he
2375000	2377000	It should be said that his upper body movement is better protected
2377000	2378000	So his upper body
2378000	2380000	It's just that his heat transmission efficiency is
2380000	2381000	More effective
2381000	2382000	Then this
2382000	2384000	This way of analysis is actually
2384000	2385000	Is a
2386000	2387000	I think it's a bit smart
2387000	2388000	No, it's not
2388000	2389000	Because this is not my way
2389000	2390000	This is my boss's way
2390000	2392000	He provided everyone with a
2392000	2393000	Provided everyone with a
2393000	2395000	To understand from the point of view of injury
2395000	2397000	Hey, what about our big team
2397000	2398000	that
2398000	2400000	Cut back on the idea at the beginning
2400000	2402000	Just when i have
2402000	2403000	Something with a bigger benefit
2403000	2405000	Or something with a bigger injury
2405000	2407000	When the block is running up
2407000	2408000	That
2408000	2410000	The smaller block of the injury is running down
2410000	2412000	But he has one
2412000	2414000	Is relatively wet
2414000	2417000	The air block has more potential to run up
2417000	2418000	Relatively dry block
2418000	2419000	He just runs down
2419000	2421000	This picture tells us to some extent
2421000	2422000	This thing
2423000	2424000	Okay, today
2424000	2427000	I think my sharing is probably here
2427000	2429000	Then there are a few things to remind everyone
2429000	2430000	Is lapse rate
2430000	2431000	Is
2431000	2433000	The value reduction rate is directly affected
2433000	2435000	Directly related to our climate change
2435000	2436000	Is if you
2437000	2438000	Just said
2438000	2439000	If these things don't make sense to you
2439000	2440000	Then we can still go back to one thing
2440000	2442000	That is, lapse rate is actually
2442000	2443000	Our background
2443000	2444000	Our
2444000	2445000	Stability
2445000	2446000	Our physical structure is there
2446000	2448000	He won't change because of climate change
2448000	2449000	Add two degrees
2449000	2450000	That
2451000	2452000	So
2452000	2453000	Lapse rate is really
2453000	2455000	Directly related to climate change
2456000	2457000	Then the second thing is
2457000	2458000	Uh
2458000	2459000	Just now we talked about heat and air
2459000	2460000	Is a relatively complex process
2460000	2461000	Is that he has
2461000	2463000	Various things
2463000	2465000	Then the stability of light is so complicated
2465000	2466000	You can imagine
2466000	2467000	If we consider all kinds of different physics
2467000	2468000	For example, consider radiation
2468000	2469000	Consider microphysics
2469000	2470000	Consider gas
2470000	2472000	How complicated it can become
2472000	2473000	Then I will
2473000	2475000	My research is counterproductive
2475000	2476000	I will take all these complicated things
2476000	2477000	Take it all
2478000	2479000	Then
2479000	2480000	After simplifying this mode
2480000	2481000	Then use numerical simulation
2481000	2482000	To solve
2482000	2483000	To
2483000	2484000	To solve this equation
2484000	2485000	To understand that this
2485000	2486000	Rise and fall
2486000	2487000	How to distribute
2487000	2488000	Then this mode
2488000	2489000	He has another advantage
2489000	2491000	Is that he can make it soundless
2492000	2493000	The analysis becomes simpler
2493000	2494000	That
2494000	2495000	Of course I don't want to talk about this today
2495000	2496000	This part
2496000	2497000	But it is
2497000	2498000	Is a simplified mode
2498000	2499000	Then he can give us a lot
2499000	2500000	Different information
2500000	2501000	Then the last one
2501000	2502000	Take home message is
2502000	2503000	Uh, wet flow
2504000	2505000	The thing is
2505000	2506000	Wet things go up
2506000	2507000	Dry things come down
2507000	2508000	That uh
2508000	2509000	In case this
2509000	2510000	This sentence doesn't make sense
2510000	2511000	It doesn't make sense to everyone
2511000	2512000	Is that we have a cloud
2512000	2513000	The place is rising
2513000	2514000	Then there are many places
2514000	2515000	It's downstream
2515000	2516000	It's downstream
2516000	2518000	The place is much more than the place that rises
2518000	2520000	Then this is a feature of wet flow
2520000	2521000	That
2521000	2522000	Uh, maybe some friends who do flow
2522000	2523000	He will say
2523000	2524000	His flow is
2524000	2525000	The rise and fall are symmetrical
2525000	2526000	That wet flow is
2526000	2527000	It's not symmetrical
2527000	2529000	And the wet flow has a very clear boundary
2529000	2531000	Cut up the rise and fall
2531000	2532000	The more you cut
2532000	2533000	Your wet flow
2534000	2536000	Then my speech is here
2536000	2537000	Then thank you very much
2537000	2538000	Thank you for coming
2538000	2539000	Then thank you very much
2539000	2540000	Friends who helped me watch the video
2540000	2541000	such
2542000	2543000	Thank you for your speech
2543000	2544000	Thank you
2546000	2548000	Is there anyone here who wants to ask questions?
2563000	2565000	Anyway, everyone can ask directly
2565000	2567000	You can chat directly
2567000	2568000	Yes yes yes yes yes
2570000	2571000	I have a question
2571000	2572000	Hello
2572000	2573000	Hi
2573000	2574000	That you just said
2574000	2576000	This thing
2577000	2578000	With your temperature
2578000	2581000	In the case of climate change
2581000	2582000	Um
2582000	2584000	Is it that it won't change?
2584000	2586000	Wet flow will not change
2586000	2587000	It's kind of like you're getting warmer
2587000	2589000	But your wet flow rate is still there
2589000	2590000	That is, it
2590000	2592000	The wet flow rate comes from the physics equation
2592000	2594000	It won't change because of your temperature increase
2594000	2595000	It's kind of like
2595000	2596000	Like first derivative
2596000	2597000	That is, you are dividing
2597000	2598000	To determine its gradient
2598000	2599000	That's it
2600000	2602000	This is my understanding
2606000	2607000	I don't know
2607000	2608000	I instinctively think
2608000	2610000	I don't quite agree with this sentence
2610000	2611000	because
2611000	2612000	Our atmosphere
2612000	2614000	Unless you are an ideal atmosphere
2614000	2615000	It's dry
2615000	2616000	Of course it's dry and hot
2616000	2617000	Yes
2619000	2620000	Especially in hot areas
2620000	2621000	There is water
2621000	2623000	The water will change as the climate changes
2623000	2624000	Yes
2624000	2625000	So you are in the atmosphere
2625000	2627000	The distribution of water will also change in the atmosphere
2627000	2628000	Yes
2628000	2629000	I think I think
2629000	2630000	When there is wet
2630000	2632000	The thing when it's wet is
2632000	2633000	It's different
2633000	2635000	I agree
2635000	2636000	That is, if there is
2636000	2637000	The process of water
2637000	2638000	This thing is completely different
2638000	2639000	Yes
2643000	2644000	Yes
2644000	2646000	It should be said that this is why
2646000	2647000	This is why
2647000	2649000	Wet flow is very complicated
2649000	2650000	So why
2650000	2651000	Why do I want to simplify this model
2651000	2652000	To see
2652000	2653000	If I only look at
2653000	2654000	Only look at
2656000	2657000	Only look at the simplified
2658000	2659000	The buoyancy structure
2659000	2660000	What will it be
2660000	2661000	Will
2661000	2662000	What are the different things
2664000	2665000	OK
2665000	2666000	Then I think this sentence should
2666000	2667000	Your take-home message
2667000	2668000	The first sentence should be
2668000	2669000	The dry
2669000	2670000	Left side
2670000	2671000	Dry right
2671000	2672000	It won't change
2672000	2673000	Yes
2673000	2674000	It's a major issue
2674000	2675000	Yes
2675000	2676000	So it's dry
2676000	2677000	It won't change
2677000	2678000	But if it's visual
2678000	2679000	If it's hot
2679000	2680000	Yes
2680000	2681000	It will change
2681000	2682000	Yes
2682000	2683000	That's right
2683000	2684000	No change
2684000	2685000	Then we can go back to your
2685000	2687000	Is that the projection of the simplified model just now?
2688000	2689000	it is good
2689000	2690000	Come here
2690000	2691000	Yes
2691000	2692000	Ah
2693000	2695000	So your model is
2696000	2697000	Assuming
2697000	2698000	In a
2698000	2700000	In an unstable environment
2701000	2702000	That's right
2702000	2703000	Then
2703000	2704000	Ah
2705000	2706000	If
2707000	2709000	In the process of a block rise
2709000	2710000	As long as it
2710000	2711000	Fluid
2711000	2712000	As long as its water reaches
2712000	2714000	The amount of water that can hold its temperature
2714000	2715000	Yes
2715000	2716000	It will be condensed
2716000	2717000	Yes
2717000	2719000	When the condensation occurs
2720000	2721000	Ah
2723000	2724000	In fact
2724000	2725000	In fact
2725000	2726000	It's not that complicated
2726000	2727000	I'm just thinking
2727000	2728000	I'm just thinking
2728000	2730000	This is the 1960s
2730000	2731000	That
2731000	2732000	That
2732000	2733000	You know that very simple
2733000	2734000	That one
2734000	2736000	What's the difference in flow parameters?
2736000	2737000	I
2737000	2738000	I think
2738000	2739000	I think it's a bit
2739000	2741000	I'll just talk about my concept
2741000	2742000	It's just
2742000	2744000	It's actually a little bit simpler than you just said
2744000	2745000	I think
2745000	2746000	I think it's a little bit simpler than what I just said
2746000	2747000	Because my
2747000	2748000	I give my
2749000	2752000	The upper and lower boundaries are actually in a state of saturation
2753000	2754000	Then
2754000	2755000	Ah
2755000	2756000	Then
2756000	2758000	There is a condition that I just mentioned
2758000	2759000	If it is saturated
2759000	2761000	There is a buoyancy below
2761000	2762000	This equation
2762000	2763000	In fact, it is
2763000	2764000	It is
2764000	2766000	If it is saturated
2766000	2768000	It is the visual heat
2768000	2771000	If it is not saturated, it is the dry heat
2772000	2775000	The process of dry heat
2775000	2776000	So it's actually
2776000	2779000	It's actually not that I
2779000	2783000	It makes it easier to judge the saturation
2783000	2785000	It's so simple that there's only one maximum to judge this thing
2787000	2788000	So
2788000	2789000	Then
2789000	2791000	Then what do I want to do?
2791000	2792000	Then
2792000	2794000	Because the boundary conditions are fixed over there
2794000	2796000	It's not like I'm giving it
2796000	2797000	It's not like the traditional atmospheric mode
2797000	2799000	I'm giving the temperature to the humidity
2799000	2801000	The volume to decide
2801000	2803000	Hey, my atmospheric mode is exactly what I gave
2803000	2804000	How many
2804000	2805000	Things are in the mode
2805000	2806000	In fact, it is
2806000	2807000	I
2807000	2808000	It's a bit like I'm giving
2808000	2809000	I'm giving
2809000	2810000	Then I give
2810000	2812000	In fact, I am giving benefits
2812000	2814000	It was originally written with benefits
2814000	2816000	This is why I want to do benefits in the first page
2816000	2817000	It is
2817000	2820000	Use benefits to drive the whole mode
2820000	2822000	Then I give the volume of benefits to decide
2822000	2823000	Hey, it's not stable
2823000	2825000	And then in the case of instability
2825000	2827000	How do I distribute things
2833000	2835000	You've already published this result, haven't you?
2835000	2836000	Hey
2836000	2837000	In the province
2837000	2839000	I got minor revision
2839000	2840000	So
2840000	2841000	OK
2841000	2843000	Maybe I'll have to look for it later
2843000	2845000	To understand the details
2845000	2846000	Yeah, I think we can
2846000	2847000	Hey, will you go to that?
2847000	2849000	Hurricane Conference
2850000	2851000	Which one is it?
2851000	2852000	Hey
2852000	2853000	May
2853000	2855000	The beginning of May is the Tropical Meteorology
2855000	2857000	Okay, let's talk about it then
2857000	2858000	OK
2858000	2859000	Thank you
2859000	2861000	Yeah, this one
2861000	2862000	This
2862000	2863000	I think it's
2863000	2864000	He simplified
2864000	2865000	Too many things
2865000	2866000	With
2866000	2867000	He even
2867000	2868000	He even
2868000	2869000	Should be
2869000	2870000	Just
2870000	2873000	He is much more simplified than the cloud
2874000	2875000	such
2880000	2882000	Is there any problem here?
2886000	2887000	If not
2887000	2888000	I can ask
2888000	2890000	Just on this picture
2890000	2891000	why
2891000	2892000	I want to understand
2892000	2894000	This is Tropical Meteorology
2894000	2896000	Why are the upper and lower boundaries saturated?
2896000	2898000	You have to calculate it as saturated
2898000	2900000	Calculated as saturated
2900000	2903000	Isn't it raining already?
2903000	2904000	Hey
2904000	2905000	Hey
2905000	2906000	Hey
2906000	2907000	Hey
2907000	2909000	Isn't it raining already?
2909000	2910000	Hey
2910000	2911000	Hey
2911000	2912000	Hey
2912000	2913000	Hey
2913000	2914000	Hey
2914000	2916000	Is it Rainy here?
2916000	2917000	Hey
2917000	2918000	Hey
2918000	2919000	Hey
2919000	2920000	Hey
2920000	2921000	Hey
2921000	2922000	Hey
2926000	2928000	The floor
2928000	2929000	Hey
2930000	2931000	Hey
2931000	2932000	Hey
2932000	2934000	It's raining
2934000	2936000	So it's a bit like
2936000	2938000	Because it can simplify a little bit of the problem
2938000	2940000	So let it become a little bit more simplified
2940000	2942000	Then
2942000	2944000	Another more practical reason
2944000	2947000	Is that we found out in the previous research
2947000	2951000	If the lower boundary is saturated and the upper boundary is not saturated
2951000	2954000	Its stability is actually relatively stable
2954000	2957000	It will be stable in the end
2957000	2959000	Then its simulation is relatively boring
2959000	2962000	It won't have a stable flow
2962000	2966000	So why do we set the upper and lower boundaries to be stable
2966000	2969000	One reason is that it can produce a more interesting result
2969000	2972000	Then another reason is that it can simplify
2972000	2975000	It can simplify what we are doing
2975000	2978000	It can reduce a variable when it is analyzed five times
2978000	2980000	Sorry
2980000	2981000	Because I don't understand at all
2981000	2983000	So what I want to understand is
2983000	2986000	This is more in line with the actual physical situation
2986000	2987000	The bottom is the sea
2987000	2988000	Then the top
2988000	2990000	The bottom sea is saturated
2990000	2992000	This I seem to understand
2992000	2993000	Yes yes yes
2993000	2994000	Then the top
2994000	2996000	It's actually not that consistent
2996000	2998000	To be honest, it's not that consistent
3000000	3002000	But
3002000	3004000	But I should say that I can add a little more
3004000	3005000	The reason it is consistent is
3005000	3007000	If you look at this cloud
3007000	3009000	If it goes up to the top
3009000	3011000	To some extent
3011000	3013000	If there is a cloud, it is still relatively saturated
3013000	3015000	So if the upper boundary is saturated
3015000	3017000	It didn't lose too much
3017000	3020000	Is related to what we originally assumed
3020000	3022000	If there is still a cloud on it
3022000	3024000	It is basically saturated
3024000	3028000	Of course, in the real atmosphere, it is the top of the stream
3028000	3029000	Its water volume is relatively difficult
3029000	3031000	Through the top of the stream to the bottom of the stream
3031000	3034000	Of course, you should say that in this situation
3034000	3037000	If there is a lot of water on the top of the stream
3037000	3039000	There are a lot of clouds like this
3039000	3042000	In fact, it is not too far from the saturation
3042000	3046000	So in fact, having a cloud means that it is already close to saturation
3046000	3048000	It should be said that there is a cloud
3048000	3050000	In fact, it is called that it is over-saturated
3050000	3052000	It will produce clouds
3052000	3055000	The process of the water vapor that I just omitted is
3055000	3057000	When I reach the saturation condition
3057000	3059000	In fact, many times
3059000	3061000	Its water droplets will not freeze
3061000	3063000	It still needs to freeze
3063000	3065000	Water will freeze
3065000	3066000	Drops
3066000	3068000	Then we have here
3068000	3070000	In fact, there is an assumption that I did not mention
3070000	3072000	It is assumed that
3073000	3076000	Water is produced as soon as it reaches saturation
3076000	3078000	In fact, this is done
3078000	3080000	Many people in the micro-physical process
3080000	3082000	They will not make this assumption
3082000	3084000	Oh understand
3088000	3092000	Then I still have one more thing to understand today
3092000	3094000	I'm sorry, I have a lot of questions
3094000	3096000	Recently all asked
3096000	3098000	Because my question should be more obvious
3098000	3100000	I'll ask him first
3101000	3103000	The first one is why
3103000	3108000	Your atmospheric simulation is incompressible fluid
3108000	3111000	In fact, this is also a very good question
3111000	3114000	Because in atmospheric
3114000	3116000	When we just talked about the cloud mode
3116000	3118000	It actually does not use incompressible
3118000	3120000	But it will use an elastic
3120000	3122000	It will make the density vertical
3122000	3124000	This situation
3124000	3126000	That is
3126000	3128000	But it is basically incompressible
3128000	3130000	If you do
3130000	3132000	When that compressible analysis
3132000	3134000	You will find that the compressible amount
3134000	3136000	In the system
3136000	3138000	Can
3138000	3140000	The contribution is very small
3140000	3142000	So it contributes less than
3142000	3144000	10-2
3144000	3146000	So this result is what we do
3146000	3148000	Because when you do
3148000	3150000	When you go to do compressible fluid
3150000	3152000	The price you need is very high
3152000	3154000	For example, your time step will become very small
3154000	3156000	Then what you can solve becomes a lot less
3156000	3158000	So rather than
3158000	3160000	Spend a long time
3160000	3162000	To do
3162000	3164000	Compressible to do that simple calculation
3164000	3166000	Why don't we take this compressible
3166000	3168000	We can do a longer time
3168000	3170000	So a lot of atmospheric
3170000	3172000	These discussions
3172000	3174000	Are all using incompressible
3174000	3176000	Gas?
3176000	3178000	They have
3178000	3180000	This is also a good question
3180000	3182000	When doing incompressible
3182000	3184000	In fact, there are different levels of incompressible
3184000	3186000	Some people's incompressible
3186000	3188000	Is divergent u is equal to 0
3188000	3190000	Then some people's incompressible
3190000	3192000	Is
3192000	3194000	Divergent rho u is equal to 0
3194000	3196000	Is that it puts density
3196000	3198000	Vertically distributed
3198000	3200000	This phenomenon
3200000	3202000	What is u?
3202000	3204000	u is
3204000	3206000	Speed is its three-dimensional speed
3206000	3208000	Its speed
3208000	3210000	Has
3210000	3212000	The density has
3212000	3214000	This is the second
3214000	3216000	Relatively complicated
3216000	3218000	Then there is
3218000	3220000	There is also
3220000	3222000	Divergent u is equal to
3222000	3224000	Its
3224000	3226000	Incompressibility
3226000	3228000	Related to the release of heat
3228000	3230000	This is a little more complicated
3230000	3232000	Then there is
3232000	3234000	If you say
3234000	3236000	Its
3236000	3238000	Related to heat
3238000	3240000	This is usually called pseudo-compressible
3240000	3242000	So it will have different levels of simplification
3242000	3244000	Of course, the more you consider
3244000	3246000	The more difficult your numerical model is
3248000	3250000	Never thought
3250000	3252000	Gas can use incompressible
3252000	3254000	To consider
3254000	3256000	It has a little bit
3256000	3258000	It should be said that if you really use compressible
3258000	3260000	You can do a lot of things
3260000	3262000	Then
3262000	3264000	In fact, after talking about compressible
3264000	3266000	It has more simplification
3266000	3268000	If your model is
3268000	3270000	Hydrostatic
3270000	3272000	Accurate
3272000	3274000	If you do it
3274000	3276000	Will simplify more
3276000	3278000	The time you can simulate is longer
3278000	3280000	But of course it is
3280000	3282000	You take this advantage
3282000	3284000	You have to sacrifice something
3284000	3286000	Then in my question
3286000	3288000	Its problem is not very good
3288000	3290000	It is a large area of ​​level
3290000	3292000	But its vertical movement is very important
3292000	3294000	So this is why
3294000	3296000	Choose such a simulation
3296000	3298000	It will choose
3298000	3300000	For example, its horizontal grid
3300000	3302000	Is 1km x 1km
3302000	3304000	But its vertical may be a few hundred meters
3308000	3310000	The last one I want to know
3310000	3312000	Why
3312000	3314000	Stable
3314000	3316000	Corresponds to
3316000	3318000	There is a video in front of you
3318000	3320000	Adiabatic process
3320000	3322000	It means it is stable
3322000	3324000	Do you want to talk about this?
3324000	3326000	This
3326000	3328000	Adiabatic
3328000	3330000	My understanding is thermal
3330000	3332000	What does it have to do with stable?
3334000	3336000	Let me think about it
3336000	3338000	If it is
3338000	3340000	In fact, we have
3340000	3342000	Equation
3342000	3344000	We put hydrostatic plus
3344000	3346000	Adiabatic process
3346000	3348000	We deduce the lapse rate
3348000	3350000	If you have hydrostatic plus
3350000	3352000	Hydrostatic plus
3352000	3354000	Add that
3354000	3356000	Adiabatic
3356000	3358000	You will get this dry lapse rate
3358000	3360000	In dry lapse rate
3360000	3362000	Your block can move up and down
3362000	3364000	Then it won't
3364000	3366000	Its movement is the same as the adiabatic process
3366000	3368000	Is consistent
3368000	3370000	If your vertical distribution
3370000	3372000	Is the distribution of the adiabatic process
3372000	3374000	Then it is up and down
3374000	3376000	In neutral state
3376000	3378000	I moved block A to block B
3378000	3380000	I found that these two blocks are the same
3380000	3382000	It means it won't
3382000	3384000	Change position
3384000	3386000	It won't run away
3386000	3388000	It means it is relatively neutral
3388000	3390000	But if you run to stable
3390000	3392000	In stable case
3392000	3394000	You exchange blocks
3394000	3396000	It will return to its original position
3396000	3398000	It means it is stable
3398000	3400000	Dry lapse rate is a
3400000	3402000	Criterion
3402000	3404000	If you are more than dry lapse rate
3404000	3406000	It will become more unstable
3406000	3408000	So
3408000	3410000	If you are less than dry lapse rate
3410000	3412000	It is relatively stable
3412000	3414000	So lapse rate is like
3414000	3416000	Stress hole
3416000	3418000	If you are less than this stress hole
3418000	3420000	It is unstable
3420000	3422000	It is stable
3424000	3426000	So you mean
3426000	3428000	When in a stable case
3428000	3430000	You just
3430000	3432000	Take a piece of air from the sky
3432000	3434000	Its
3434000	3436000	It will float
3436000	3438000	It is the same
3438000	3440000	If it is dry lapse rate
3440000	3442000	It is the same
3442000	3444000	You have a profile
3444000	3446000	If it is dry lapse rate
3446000	3448000	If you take a normal air
3448000	3450000	Because it is stable
3450000	3452000	So you take an air from the sky
3452000	3454000	You wrap it with a balloon
3454000	3456000	Because when it comes down
3456000	3458000	It will compress
3458000	3460000	It will compress into a smaller air
3460000	3462000	When you bring it to the ground
3462000	3464000	Because it passed the cooling process
3464000	3466000	Its cooling will be more
3466000	3468000	Because it is stable
3468000	3470000	The air will float
3470000	3472000	The air will float
3472000	3474000	You mean
3474000	3476000	The condition is
3476000	3478000	You
3478000	3480000	You put
3480000	3482000	15°C
3482000	3484000	Put it
3484000	3486000	200
3486000	3488000	2 km
3488000	3490000	Its buoyancy is equal to 0
3490000	3492000	These two things are the same
3492000	3494000	This can be inferred
3494000	3496000	Yes
3496000	3498000	If
3498000	3500000	Let me think
3500000	3502000	If you are on the lapse rate
3502000	3504000	The whole block
3504000	3506000	Its buoyancy is equal to 0
3506000	3508000	It will not
3508000	3510000	It is not very good
3510000	3512000	It is trying to stabilize
3512000	3514000	Its buoyancy is equal to the weight of the block
3514000	3516000	Yes
3518000	3520000	This is quite interesting
3520000	3522000	You can look it up
3522000	3524000	Yes
3524000	3526000	If
3526000	3528000	If your institute has a book
3528000	3530000	You can refer to it
3530000	3532000	It is called atmospheric thermodynamics
3532000	3534000	The series of books
3540000	3542000	My question is finished
3542000	3544000	Thank you
3544000	3546000	Is there any professional question here?
3550000	3552000	No?
3556000	3558000	I will turn off the recording
3558000	3560000	Thank you
3560000	3562000	Thank you
