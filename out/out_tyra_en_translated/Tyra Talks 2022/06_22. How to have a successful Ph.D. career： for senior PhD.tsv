0	7000	Welcome everyone to the Terra Talk on August 6th.
7000	11000	Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.
11000	17000	Dr. Chen Tai-Yan currently teaches at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston.
17000	21000	She graduated from the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University and the Department of Chemistry at Tsinghua University.
21000	24000	Her Ph.D. was in Texas A&M.
24000	29000	She did her Ph.D. in agricultural engineering.
29000	34000	After her Ph.D., she moved to Cornell.
34000	39000	Her field of research is mostly...
39000	41000	Did I say it right?
41000	44000	I saw Dr. Tai-Yan laughing.
44000	52000	Her field of research is mostly single-molecule super-resolution microscopy.
52000	58000	Her research system is mostly biophysics.
58000	60000	Dr. Tai-Yan is a very good teacher.
60000	67000	She has given lectures in different fields and topics at Terra.
67000	78000	Today, she will be talking about...
78000	81000	As a senior Ph.D. student,
81000	84000	when your Ph.D. is in its second or third year,
84000	86000	you have gone through a lot.
86000	88000	When you think about your next phase,
88000	91000	you have to prepare yourself.
91000	93000	You have to ask yourself some good questions.
93000	106000	This will allow you to move on to the next phase more smoothly.
106000	114000	Let's welcome Dr. Chen Tai-Yan.
114000	116000	Thank you, Dr. Tai-Yan.
116000	122000	I am very happy to be able to participate in Project Terra's talk today.
122000	126000	First of all, thanks for the kind invitation.
126000	128000	This talk is more informal.
128000	130000	If you have any questions,
130000	134000	you can ask them in the middle of my talk.
134000	142000	I hope you can learn a lot from today's talk.
143000	148000	This is a topic we talked about in the beginning of Project Terra.
148000	153000	How to have a successful Ph.D. career for senior Ph.D. students.
153000	163000	I was surprised when I first saw this title.
163000	166000	It uses a very special word,
166000	169000	which is successful Ph.D. career.
170000	174000	It is very difficult to define a successful Ph.D. career.
174000	179000	I personally feel that every student has a different background.
179000	183000	Everyone has a different Ph.D. career,
183000	188000	so there is no specific formula for everyone.
188000	194000	What I am doing today is to share my personal experience
194000	201000	and tell you what you can do to have a positive impact on your future development.
201000	205000	Everyone has a different background,
205000	209000	so you can try it if it suits you.
209000	216000	I hope these tips can help you to have a better Ph.D. career.
216000	221000	Let me briefly introduce my personal experience.
221000	224000	My experience is not ordinary.
224000	231000	I am a slow learner in every process.
231000	233000	I think it is related to my personality.
233000	237000	I am a gentle person.
237000	242000	You can see that I started my Ph.D. degree in 2018.
242000	246000	I graduated from my senior year in 2004.
246000	250000	I worked as a research assistant for a year and went abroad in 2005.
250000	254000	Before that, I was a chemistry major,
254000	256000	specifically a material scientist.
256000	261000	My main job was to synthesize some materials
261000	263000	and make some luminous materials.
263000	266000	I was focused on synthesis.
266000	270000	When I finished my Ph.D. degree,
270000	274000	my boss asked me if I wanted to study for a Ph.D. degree.
274000	279000	I looked back at my classmates in the Ph.D. class.
279000	281000	I found that everyone was doing the same thing.
281000	285000	I found that everyone was doing the same thing.
285000	289000	My boss told me to study for a Ph.D. degree,
289000	291000	or else I would have to work in the industry.
291000	296000	At that time, I didn't have any prior knowledge.
296000	301000	I was a country boy from Hualien.
301000	305000	After studying at Tsingtao University for a few years,
305000	308000	I never thought about going abroad.
308000	310000	It wasn't until my boss mentioned this to me
310000	314000	that I seriously thought about going abroad.
314000	318000	I was lucky enough to apply for A&M.
318000	324000	Since then, I have been living in the U.S. for 17 years.
324000	327000	When I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,
327000	329000	I decided to change my field.
329000	332000	I thought synthesis was fun,
332000	340000	but I felt like I was in a bottleneck.
340000	344000	I thought I understood how to do synthesis,
344000	346000	but I didn't know if I did a good job.
346000	351000	I didn't know how to determine the efficiency of synthesis.
351000	356000	I started to feel like we didn't discuss it in detail.
356000	357000	When doing synthesis,
357000	360000	we just guessed how to make it more efficient.
360000	364000	We didn't have a more fundamental understanding.
364000	366000	So when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,
366000	368000	I decided to change my field.
368000	373000	I wanted to know more about the physics of these materials.
373000	376000	At that time, Neoparticle was very popular.
376000	379000	So I joined a lab that specializes in Neoparticle
379000	388000	and does a lot of electronic, light, magnetic analysis.
388000	391000	So I spent five and a half years doing this.
391000	393000	During that time,
393000	396000	I learned how to add a device,
396000	398000	how to analyze,
398000	402000	and how to understand the advantages and disadvantages of a material
402000	405000	from a very fundamental perspective.
405000	408000	After that,
408000	411000	I started to think that
411000	413000	when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,
413000	416000	I already had an intention that I wanted to be a teacher.
416000	418000	When I started to study for my Ph.D. degree,
418000	421000	my first goal was that I wanted to go back to Taiwan to be a professor.
421000	425000	But then I met a lot of different people.
425000	429000	So in the end, I ended up being a teacher in the U.S.
432000	435000	Later, you can see that
435000	436000	from Maths to Ph.D.,
436000	438000	it's a bit like turning a corner.
438000	442000	You start to do very materialized things.
442000	444000	But I think the biggest turning point in my life
444000	447000	was when I was studying for my postdoc.
447000	449000	Before that,
449000	453000	I didn't have any background in biology.
453000	455000	But when I was studying for my postdoc,
455000	458000	I did a 90-degree turn.
458000	462000	I spent five and a half years doing postdocs.
462000	463000	At that time,
463000	467000	I started to learn about monochromatic biology.
467000	470000	The main reason was that
470000	471000	when I was studying for my Ph.D. degree,
471000	472000	I met my wife.
472000	474000	My wife is a neon biologist.
474000	475000	I thought,
475000	476000	okay,
476000	478000	we can do some research together in the future.
478000	481000	Let's learn something new.
481000	482000	But I didn't expect that
482000	485000	learning something new would take me five and a half years.
485000	488000	So I spent five and a half years in Cornell.
488000	490000	I was hired to Cornell
490000	492000	mainly because I knew how to drive a car.
492000	493000	So when I got there,
493000	498000	my main job was to build up a super-low-energy microscope,
498000	502000	and create software to analyze images.
502000	503000	That was my main job,
503000	505000	building instruments and analyzing things.
505000	507000	That was my main job.
507000	509000	But when I joined a new element,
509000	513000	my career took a big turn.
513000	514000	Later on,
514000	516000	you can see that my current research program
516000	521000	started to connect with neural cells.
521000	527000	This process is very interesting.
527000	528000	Okay.
528000	530000	If you have good support,
530000	532000	this is a very enjoyable process.
532000	536000	But it's not a typical process.
536000	540000	I don't recommend everyone to try this mode.
540000	542000	This mode has its advantages,
542000	545000	but I think the difficulties in the middle are quite high.
545000	546000	If you are interested,
546000	548000	we can talk about this later.
548000	552000	The main reason why I mentioned this is because
552000	553000	you can see that
553000	557000	I made a lot of changes in the direction of the pressure.
557000	559000	In the process of these changes,
559000	562000	I think there is one thing I often do.
562000	565000	I like to chat with my friends,
565000	569000	or I like to chat with my junior in the lab.
569000	570000	In the process of chatting,
570000	572000	the most frequently asked question is,
572000	573000	okay,
573000	574000	the most frequently asked question is,
574000	575000	okay,
575000	577000	why do you want to study for a PhD?
577000	579000	When you study for a PhD,
579000	581000	what is the biggest challenge you face?
582000	586000	I've been asking this question for 17 years.
586000	587000	So I think,
587000	588000	in these processes,
588000	592000	you can know what everyone thinks about PhDs.
592000	595000	After hearing a lot of people's opinions,
595000	597000	I started to have some questions about
597000	600000	what PhDs are all about.
600000	602000	Last week,
602000	604000	last week or the week before last,
604000	605000	last week,
606000	611000	Project Tara invited Bo-Jun to share with you
611000	617000	what he thinks about PhDs.
617000	622000	He also provided a lot of very useful advice.
622000	627000	Here are some of the things he provided.
627000	628000	For example,
628000	630000	why do you want to study for a PhD?
630000	631000	What do you want to do?
631000	632000	How to find advice?
632000	633000	Some general advice.
633000	635000	I think they're all very, very good.
635000	637000	What I'm going to do today,
637000	640000	I still want to address
640000	643000	why I want to study for a PhD.
643000	644000	Okay.
644000	646000	In my personal opinion,
646000	650000	this is the most important of all.
650000	652000	If you clearly know
652000	655000	why you want to study for a PhD,
655000	657000	I think when you encounter a lot of difficulties,
657000	660000	it will be much better to adjust your mindset.
660000	662000	Okay.
662000	663000	When people ask you,
663000	665000	why do you want to study for a PhD?
665000	667000	I think the question you need to reflect on is,
667000	671000	what is the meaning of a PhD to me?
671000	675000	I used to hear a lot of answers.
675000	679000	If you have a PhD,
679000	682000	don't say you can independently solve problems.
682000	683000	You can actually create,
683000	686000	find new knowledge by yourself.
686000	689000	I think these are all very good answers.
689000	691000	But,
691000	693000	it's my own feeling.
693000	696000	It's my own feeling.
696000	700000	I think a PhD is actually a lifestyle.
700000	703000	Okay.
703000	704000	So far,
704000	706000	my personal understanding is that
706000	709000	we were born until you grew up.
709000	711000	We've been trying to understand
711000	714000	how the world works.
714000	717000	It depends on your professional training.
717000	718000	Okay.
718000	721000	People, things, and objects
721000	722000	will make you
722000	723000	a little bit twisted
723000	725000	about how the world works.
725000	726000	Okay.
726000	727000	Everyone knows that
727000	729000	these may be the same.
729000	730000	Okay.
730000	731000	But those little things
731000	734000	will basically become the tipping point
734000	736000	for you to make a decision.
736000	737000	Okay.
737000	738000	So I think
738000	740000	if you study for a PhD,
740000	743000	the biggest advantage is
743000	745000	that it is an excellent training platform.
745000	746000	Okay.
746000	748000	So when you encounter a problem,
748000	751000	you know how to analyze the problem,
751000	753000	how to define the problem,
753000	755000	and how to solve the problem.
755000	758000	Then you can explain to others
758000	760000	that I encountered this problem,
760000	761000	and what I think it should be like.
761000	762000	Okay.
762000	763000	When it's like this,
763000	765000	I think it should have some impact.
765000	766000	Okay.
766000	767000	These things are actually
767000	769000	when you do experiments,
769000	770000	when you do research,
770000	773000	I think there is a very, very big overlap.
773000	774000	Okay.
774000	776000	To a certain extent,
776000	778000	I think if you can imagine
778000	780000	a PhD as
780000	783000	your last training stage,
783000	784000	then I think
784000	786000	if you can learn
786000	787000	its essence,
787000	789000	I think it will be a very helpful process
789000	791000	for your life.
791000	792000	Okay.
792000	793000	Like I just said,
793000	794000	okay,
794000	796000	let's make a comparison.
796000	797000	Okay.
797000	798000	When you encounter a problem,
798000	799000	okay,
799000	800000	the first thing is
800000	801000	you have to understand
801000	803000	what the problem is.
803000	804000	Right?
804000	805000	Then this is the same as
805000	806000	when you do academic research,
806000	807000	okay,
807000	808000	you do a lot of literature research,
808000	809000	it's actually the same.
809000	810000	Okay.
810000	811000	At first,
811000	812000	when you come up with a phenomenon,
812000	813000	you don't know what happened.
813000	814000	Okay.
814000	815000	What you can do is
815000	816000	okay,
816000	817000	I'm going to look for more documents
817000	818000	to give me a better understanding
818000	820000	of this system.
820000	821000	Okay.
821000	822000	In this case,
822000	825000	you can start to define your problem.
825000	826000	In other words,
826000	828000	you can start to formulate your hypothesis.
828000	829000	Okay.
829000	830000	After that,
830000	831000	once you have a hypothesis,
831000	832000	you can do the experiment.
832000	833000	Then after the experiment,
833000	834000	you might say,
834000	835000	okay,
835000	836000	in the end,
836000	837000	okay,
837000	838000	you might fail many times in the middle,
838000	839000	but in the end,
839000	840000	most likely,
840000	841000	you can actually figure out something new.
841000	842000	Right?
842000	843000	Now,
843000	844000	after this is over,
844000	845000	one very important thing,
845000	846000	one very important training
846000	847000	in Ph.D. is
847000	848000	okay,
848000	849000	you need to actually
849000	850000	present your results.
850000	851000	Okay.
851000	853000	Tell people why this is actually important.
853000	854000	Okay.
854000	855000	Then this thing
855000	856000	will be in your training,
856000	858000	in your presentation training,
858000	861000	to get a
861000	863000	proper
863000	864000	preparation.
864000	865000	Okay.
865000	866000	So, in my opinion,
866000	868000	I think the biggest advantage of Ph.D. is that
868000	870000	you learn a more systematic
870000	872000	method
872000	874000	to deal with
874000	876000	the problems in your life.
876000	877000	Okay.
877000	879000	This is a relatively broad statement.
879000	880000	But I think
880000	882000	you project
882000	884000	what you learn in Ph.D.
884000	886000	into your life experience.
886000	888000	I think this is the most
888000	890000	meaningful thing.
890000	891000	Okay.
891000	892000	So, this is
892000	894000	how I view the Ph.D.
894000	896000	So, I think
896000	898000	what everyone does may not be the same.
898000	899000	Okay.
899000	900000	But the underlying principle
900000	903000	and how you deal with things in your life
903000	905000	I think this really provides a
905000	907000	very, very good training place.
907000	908000	Okay.
908000	910000	So,
910000	911000	how do you define
911000	913000	whether your Ph.D. is successful or not?
913000	915000	I think
915000	916000	the easiest parameter is
916000	919000	whether you enjoy the process.
919000	920000	If you can enjoy
920000	921000	the process,
921000	922000	and you can
922000	924000	make the things on the slide
924000	926000	to an extreme,
926000	928000	I think it's a very successful
928000	930000	Ph.D. career.
930000	931000	Because the things you need
931000	933000	can follow you for a lifetime.
933000	935000	I think this is more important
935000	936000	than anything else.
936000	937000	Okay.
937000	938000	Of course,
938000	939000	some people do better,
939000	940000	some people do worse.
940000	941000	But so what?
941000	942000	Okay.
942000	943000	Paper is paper, right?
943000	944000	You can create new knowledge,
944000	946000	but it's not going to go with you forever.
946000	947000	Right?
947000	949000	You have to face new problems every day.
949000	950000	Knowing how to handle these problems
950000	951000	is more important,
951000	952000	I think.
952000	953000	Okay.
953000	954000	Okay, get back to this.
954000	955000	I think
955000	957000	the timeline is important.
957000	959000	When you're doing your Ph.D.,
959000	961000	there's a timeline
961000	962000	in your mind.
962000	963000	I think this is
963000	964000	a very, very important thing.
964000	965000	Okay.
965000	966000	I've highlighted some
966000	968000	more important
968000	969000	milestones
969000	971000	for your Ph.D.
971000	972000	In the first year,
972000	973000	when you first came in,
973000	975000	get used to the environment,
975000	977000	finish the course as soon as possible.
977000	978000	In the second year,
978000	979000	you'll start to have
979000	980000	the so-called
980000	981000	Qualified Exam.
981000	982000	Okay.
982000	983000	After the Qualified Exam,
983000	984000	you'll become
984000	986000	the so-called Ph.D. candidate.
986000	987000	You're no longer
987000	988000	just a student.
988000	989000	Okay.
989000	990000	You're not a graduate student.
990000	992000	You're a Ph.D. candidate.
992000	993000	Okay.
993000	995000	Then you start to propose
995000	996000	what you want to do.
996000	997000	Then
997000	998000	work very hard,
998000	999000	publish some papers.
999000	1001000	In the end,
1001000	1002000	this is
1002000	1003000	okay,
1003000	1004000	pass your dissertation.
1004000	1005000	Then eventually,
1005000	1006000	do your defense.
1006000	1007000	Then eventually,
1007000	1008000	get your Ph.D.
1008000	1009000	Okay.
1009000	1010000	So it's a very, very
1010000	1011000	general process.
1011000	1012000	This process
1012000	1013000	usually takes you
1013000	1014000	four to five years,
1014000	1015000	depending on
1015000	1016000	your research field.
1016000	1017000	Okay.
1017000	1018000	But I think
1018000	1019000	five years
1019000	1020000	has become
1020000	1021000	a more and more
1021000	1023000	common timeline.
1023000	1024000	Yes.
1024000	1025000	Of course,
1025000	1026000	I guess engineers
1026000	1027000	may be faster.
1027000	1028000	But I think
1028000	1029000	five years at the Institute of Technology
1029000	1030000	seems to be more and more common.
1030000	1031000	The good thing is
1031000	1032000	I think I've seen
1032000	1033000	more and more colleges
1033000	1034000	recently
1034000	1035000	put
1035000	1036000	some teachers
1036000	1037000	will let students
1037000	1038000	stay for six or seven years.
1038000	1039000	This kind of thing
1039000	1040000	they do have
1040000	1041000	put in effort
1041000	1042000	to minimize
1042000	1043000	these things
1043000	1044000	happen.
1044000	1045000	Okay.
1045000	1046000	So
1046000	1047000	but I guess
1047000	1048000	in general,
1048000	1049000	it should be
1049000	1050000	about five years
1050000	1051000	will be a reasonable timeline.
1051000	1052000	Okay.
1052000	1053000	In these five years,
1053000	1054000	I think
1054000	1055000	it can be divided
1055000	1056000	into two stages.
1056000	1057000	Okay.
1057000	1058000	The first stage
1058000	1059000	I call
1059000	1060000	training phase.
1060000	1061000	Okay.
1061000	1062000	The second one
1062000	1063000	is actually
1063000	1064000	networking phase.
1064000	1065000	Okay.
1065000	1066000	Training phase
1066000	1067000	is usually
1067000	1068000	if everything is ideal,
1068000	1069000	I think
1069000	1070000	the better time
1070000	1071000	is in the first three years
1071000	1072000	to put
1072000	1073000	the training
1073000	1074000	Okay.
1074000	1075000	The skill set
1075000	1076000	should have
1076000	1077000	should have
1077000	1078000	knowledge
1078000	1079000	in the first three years
1079000	1080000	should be
1080000	1081000	almost the same.
1081000	1082000	Okay.
1082000	1083000	The fourth and fifth years
1083000	1084000	should be
1084000	1085000	focused on
1085000	1086000	networking
1086000	1087000	things.
1087000	1088000	Okay.
1088000	1089000	Networking
1089000	1090000	I said networking
1090000	1091000	is like
1091000	1092000	going to a conference
1092000	1093000	or
1093000	1094000	dealing with people
1094000	1095000	you don't know.
1095000	1096000	Okay.
1096000	1097000	Start reaching out
1097000	1098000	to the company.
1098000	1099000	Okay.
1099000	1100000	The so-called
1100000	1101000	networking phase.
1101000	1102000	Okay.
1102000	1103000	A lot of people
1103000	1104000	squeeze this
1104000	1105000	networking phase
1105000	1106000	to the last
1106000	1107000	semester.
1107000	1108000	My personal feeling
1108000	1109000	that it's too late.
1109000	1110000	Okay.
1110000	1111000	So I think
1111000	1112000	having this
1112000	1113000	timeline
1113000	1114000	is important
1114000	1115000	in my heart.
1115000	1116000	Okay.
1116000	1117000	Let's talk
1117000	1118000	about
1118000	1119000	more
1119000	1120000	more
1120000	1121000	simple
1121000	1122000	more fundamental
1122000	1123000	things
1123000	1124000	like
1124000	1125000	how to
1125000	1126000	do things
1126000	1127000	on the food.
1127000	1128000	I think
1128000	1129000	you can try
1129000	1130000	to make
1130000	1131000	the training phase
1131000	1132000	more smooth.
1132000	1133000	Okay.
1133000	1134000	In the training phase
1134000	1135000	I think
1135000	1136000	there are
1136000	1137000	three main points.
1137000	1138000	The first point
1138000	1139000	is
1139000	1140000	in the training
1140000	1141000	skill set
1141000	1142000	is always
1142000	1143000	an important thing.
1143000	1144000	Okay.
1144000	1145000	Not everyone
1145000	1146000	wants to
1146000	1147000	be an
1147000	1148000	engineer.
1148000	1149000	Okay.
1149000	1150000	In the industry
1150000	1151000	when you
1151000	1152000	are looking for
1152000	1153000	a job
1153000	1154000	what skills
1154000	1155000	will you list
1155000	1156000	on your CV?
1156000	1157000	The company
1157000	1158000	will look at
1158000	1159000	your skills
1159000	1160000	to decide
1160000	1161000	if you are
1161000	1162000	the person
1162000	1163000	they need.
1163000	1164000	Okay.
1164000	1165000	So
1165000	1166000	scientific skills
1166000	1167000	I think
1167000	1168000	when you
1168000	1169000	think
1169000	1170000	okay
1170000	1171000	you feel like
1171000	1172000	okay
1172000	1173000	maybe I'm not
1173000	1174000	that into
1174000	1175000	academia
1175000	1176000	then I think
1176000	1177000	skills
1177000	1178000	will become
1178000	1179000	a very
1179000	1180000	important
1180000	1181000	element
1181000	1182000	when you
1182000	1183000	are looking
1183000	1184000	for an
1184000	1185000	industry job.
1185000	1186000	Okay.
1186000	1187000	The second
1187000	1188000	is literature.
1188000	1189000	I think
1189000	1190000	literature
1190000	1191000	is relatively
1191000	1192000	important
1192000	1193000	in academia
1193000	1194000	because
1194000	1195000	if you
1195000	1196000	want to
1196000	1197000	go into
1197000	1198000	academia
1198000	1199000	you need to
1199000	1200000	propose
1200000	1201000	a lot
1201000	1202000	of experiments.
1202000	1203000	When you
1203000	1204000	propose
1204000	1205000	a lot of
1205000	1206000	experiments
1206000	1207000	it will
1207000	1208000	not
1208000	1209000	be a
1209000	1210000	random
1210000	1211000	experiment.
1211000	1212000	So
1212000	1213000	you need to
1213000	1214000	know if
1214000	1215000	it has
1215000	1216000	a big
1216000	1217000	impact
1217000	1218000	so you
1218000	1219000	need to
1219000	1220000	go
1220000	1221000	deep
1221000	1222000	into
1222000	1223000	the
1223000	1224000	professional
1224000	1225000	subjects.
1225000	1226000	So
1226000	1227000	literature
1227000	1228000	is a
1228000	1229000	very
1229000	1230000	important
1230000	1231000	element
1231000	1232000	especially
1232000	1233000	when you
1233000	1234000	are
1234000	1235000	looking
1235000	1236000	for an
1236000	1237000	industry job.
1237000	1238000	Okay.
1238000	1239000	Alright.
1239000	1240000	Let's talk
1240000	1241000	about the
1241000	1242000	scientific
1242000	1243000	skills.
1243000	1244000	Okay.
1244000	1245000	I think
1245000	1246000	when you
1246000	1247000	join a
1247000	1248000	lab
1248000	1249000	no,
1249000	1250000	before you
1250000	1251000	join a
1251000	1252000	lab
1252000	1253000	you need to
1253000	1254000	know
1254000	1255000	what
1255000	1256000	skills
1256000	1257000	you can
1257000	1258000	learn
1258000	1259000	from
1259000	1260000	joining
1260000	1261000	this
1261000	1262000	lab.
1262000	1263000	Okay.
1263000	1264000	Sometimes
1264000	1265000	when students
1265000	1266000	are looking
1266000	1267000	for a
1267000	1268000	lab
1268000	1269000	they don't
1269000	1270000	know
1270000	1271000	what they
1271000	1272000	want.
1272000	1273000	Okay.
1273000	1274000	To be honest
1274000	1275000	I think
1275000	1276000	more than
1276000	1277000	80% of
1277000	1278000	students
1278000	1279000	don't
1279000	1280000	know
1280000	1281000	what
1281000	1282000	they
1282000	1283000	want
1283000	1284000	because
1284000	1285000	they
1285000	1286000	haven't
1286000	1287000	really
1287000	1288000	thought
1288000	1289000	about
1289000	1290000	it.
1290000	1291000	Okay.
1291000	1292000	So,
1292000	1293000	when you
1293000	1294000	join a
1294000	1295000	lab
1295000	1296000	you
1296000	1297000	need to
1297000	1298000	know
1298000	1299000	what
1299000	1300000	skills
1300000	1301000	you

2265000	2266000	getting
2266000	2267000	your dream
2267000	2268000	postdoc position
2268000	2269000	is not

2275000	2276000	the position
2276000	2277000	and the
2277000	2278000	target,
2278000	2279000	they will
2279000	2280000	usually
2280000	2281000	request
2281000	2282000	you to

2417000	2418000	must
2418000	2419000	know
2419000	2420000	who
2420000	2421000	is
2421000	2422000	the
2422000	2423000	most
2423000	2424000	important
2424000	2425000	person
2425000	2426000	who
2426000	2427000	can
2427000	2428000	write
2428000	2429000	the
2429000	2430000	letter
2430000	2431000	for
2431000	2432000	you.
2432000	2433000	Okay.
2433000	2434000	I
2434000	2435000	have written
2435000	2436000	a lot of
2436000	2437000	letters.
2437000	2438000	Okay.
2438000	2439000	Not
2439000	2440000	all of them
2440000	2441000	are
2441000	2442000	very
2442000	2443000	powerful.
2443000	2444000	Okay.
2444000	2445000	I
2445000	2446000	will
2446000	2447000	write
2447000	2448000	letters
2448000	2449000	that
2449000	2450000	are
2450000	2451000	very
2451000	2452000	powerful.
2452000	2453000	I
2453000	2454000	really
2454000	2455000	know
2455000	2456000	who
2456000	2457000	this
2457000	2458000	person
2458000	2459000	is.
2459000	2460000	Okay.
2460000	2461000	I
2461000	2462000	observe
2462000	2463000	the
2463000	2464000	time
2464000	2465000	and
2465000	2466000	the
2466000	2467000	incubation
2467000	2468000	of
2468000	2469000	the
2469000	2470000	professor.
2470000	2471000	Okay.
2471000	2472000	I
2472000	2473000	will
2473000	2474000	write
2474000	2475000	powerful
2475000	2476000	letters.
2476000	2477000	Okay.
2477000	2478000	I
2478000	2479000	recommend
2479000	2480000	him for
2480000	2481000	this
2481000	2482000	position.
2482000	2483000	Okay.
2483000	2484000	This
2484000	2485000	is the
2485000	2486000	worst
2486000	2487000	letter
2487000	2488000	you
2488000	2489000	can
2489000	2490000	write.
2490000	2491000	Okay.
2491000	2492000	This
2492000	2493000	is the
2493000	2494000	worst
2494000	2495000	letter
2495000	2496000	you
2496000	2497000	want to
2497000	2498000	have.
2498000	2499000	Okay.
2499000	2500000	Not
2500000	2501000	all of
2501000	2502000	them
2502000	2503000	are
2503000	2504000	powerful.
2504000	2505000	Okay.
2505000	2506000	This
2506000	2507000	is the
2507000	2508000	worst
2508000	2509000	letter
2509000	2510000	you
2510000	2511000	want to
2511000	2512000	have.
2512000	2513000	Okay.
2513000	2514000	This
2514000	2515000	is the
2515000	2516000	worst
2516000	2517000	letter
2517000	2518000	you
2518000	2519000	want to
2519000	2520000	have.
2520000	2521000	Okay.
2521000	2522000	Okay.
2522000	2523000	This
2523000	2524000	is the
2524000	2525000	worst
2525000	2526000	letter
2526000	2527000	you
2527000	2528000	need to
2528000	2529000	learn.
2529000	2530000	Okay.
2530000	2531000	Like
2531000	2532000	this.
2532000	2533000	All
2533000	2534000	right.
2534000	2535000	And
2543000	2544000	the
2544000	2545000	last
2545000	2547000	will be
2547000	2548000	a
2548000	2549000	review
2549000	2550000	little
2550000	2551000	recommendation.
2551000	2552000	Okay.
2552000	2553000	Okay.
2553000	2554000	Now
2554000	2555000	come back to
2555000	2556000	this.
2556000	2557000	Okay.
2557000	2558000	Again, five
2558000	2559000	years, right?
2559000	2560000	Two phases.
2560000	2561000	Okay.
2561000	2562000	How do
2562000	2563000	you accomplish
2563000	2564000	these tasks
2564000	2565000	within five
2565000	2566000	years?
2566000	2585000	Okay.
2585000	2586000	Okay.
2587000	2588000	Okay.
2588000	2589000	Well,
2589000	2594000	I can't really share my thoughts on this.
2594000	2599000	Because everyone really has different needs.
2599000	2604000	So, I think that the way I usually go about it is
2604000	2607000	to think long term first.
2607000	2611000	I'm the type of person who starts to think long term and then slowly goes back to short term.
2611000	2615000	But some people like to start short term and then slowly go back to long term.
2615000	2617000	Either way is fine.
2617000	2620000	But I think that if I were to do this,
2620000	2623000	I would start with what my goal is for this semester.
2623000	2624000	Okay.
2624000	2626000	Let's say that's my goal.
2626000	2629000	How far should I go in terms of time allocation
2629000	2631000	in the first month and how far should I go in the second month?
2631000	2632000	Okay.
2632000	2635000	If I have a goal for this month,
2635000	2637000	what should I do every week?
2637000	2638000	Right?
2638000	2642000	Then you can slowly go back to how far you want to go every day.
2642000	2643000	Okay.
2644000	2647000	PhD is a marathon.
2647000	2648000	Okay.
2648000	2649000	It's a five-year process.
2649000	2651000	So, in the middle of this process,
2651000	2654000	I think planned vacation is also very important.
2654000	2655000	Okay.
2655000	2657000	When I was studying for my PhD,
2657000	2659000	every summer vacation,
2659000	2662000	I'm a person who really likes to go to National Park.
2662000	2664000	So, every summer vacation,
2664000	2667000	I would force myself to go to a National Park.
2667000	2668000	Okay.
2668000	2670000	So, I've been to a lot of different National Parks.
2670000	2671000	Okay.
2671000	2675000	I think that's a process that allows you to recharge yourself.
2675000	2677000	So, after these five years,
2677000	2679000	you won't feel like you're totally burned out.
2679000	2680000	Okay.
2680000	2684000	I think the most important thing is to let yourself enjoy this process.
2684000	2685000	All right?
2685000	2686000	Okay.
2686000	2687000	Finally,
2687000	2692000	I want to use this slide to summarize today's presentation.
2692000	2693000	Okay.
2693000	2694000	Okay.
2694000	2697000	I think mentality is a very, very important thing.
2697000	2698000	Okay.
2698000	2699000	Okay.
2718000	2719000	Okay.
2719000	2721000	Okay.
2721000	2724000	Okay.
2724000	2725000	Okay.
2725000	2726000	Okay.
2727000	2730000	Okay.
2738000	2739000	Okay.
2740000	2741000	Okay.
2741000	2742000	Okay.
2743000	2744000	Okay.
2750000	2751000	Okay.
2751000	2752000	Okay.
2752000	2753000	Okay.
2757000	2758000	Okay.
2759000	2760000	Okay.
2770000	2771000	Okay.
2771000	2774000	But the most important thing is that, okay,
2776000	2779000	you can only improve when you do your presentation.
2779000	2780000	Okay.
2780000	2785000	If you don't improve, you will only feel good about yourself.
2785000	2786000	Okay.
2786000	2788000	You have to really do these things.
2788000	2789000	Okay.
2789000	2791000	It won't be too beautiful at first.
2791000	2792000	Okay.
2792000	2795000	But that is okay because that is not your,
2795000	2797000	that is not your last presentation.
2797000	2798000	Okay.
2798000	2800000	In this process, no matter what you do,
2800000	2802000	you are just preparing for the last one.
2802000	2803000	Okay.
2803000	2806000	So you'd rather practice as many times as you can in this process.
2806000	2807000	Okay.
2807000	2809000	The more times you practice, the better.
2809000	2811000	Once you know how to fold,
2811000	2813000	you won't fold like this in the future.
2813000	2814000	Okay.
2814000	2819000	So I think it's good for you to experience a lot of setbacks.
2819000	2821000	Of course, it's hard on your mind.
2821000	2822000	Okay.
2822000	2824000	But when you fold a lot of times,
2824000	2827000	your mind becomes relatively strong.
2827000	2828000	Okay.
2828000	2832000	Then your endurance becomes very, very high.
2832000	2833000	Okay.
2833000	2836000	So I would strongly recommend that everyone is able to,
2836000	2837000	don't be shy.
2837000	2838000	Okay.
2838000	2839000	You can do a presentation,
2839000	2840000	go out and do a presentation.
2840000	2842000	Even if you know you are not ready,
2842000	2843000	but still do it.
2843000	2844000	Okay.
2844000	2846000	Then, um,
2846000	2848000	last, last, last.
2848000	2850000	I think this is actually not what I wrote.
2850000	2852000	There are goals, there are opportunities, there are plans.
2852000	2854000	This is not what I'm talking about.
2854000	2855000	Okay.
2855000	2856000	This is what Zhang Zhongmeng said.
2856000	2857000	Once I listened to his speech,
2857000	2862000	I think these things are very suitable for PhD students.
2862000	2863000	Okay.
2863000	2865000	Like I said, five years is not a long time,
2865000	2866000	not a short time, right?
2866000	2869000	But in order to be efficient to accomplish your goal,
2869000	2872000	having a goal is very, very important.
2872000	2874000	Because only if you have a goal,
2874000	2875000	then you can have a plan.
2875000	2876000	Okay.
2876000	2877000	Without a goal, there is no plan.
2877000	2878000	Okay.
2878000	2882000	So the goal and the plan are actually put together.
2882000	2883000	Okay.
2883000	2884000	The goal is your focus.
2884000	2886000	The plan is just a means to pursue the goal.
2886000	2887000	Okay.
2887000	2888000	Then there is a discipline.
2888000	2892000	Discipline is something that everyone should know.
2892000	2894000	Because in this process,
2895000	2897000	it's not an easy process.
2897000	2898000	Okay.
2898000	2901000	In order to really achieve to a certain level,
2901000	2905000	discipline is very, very, very important.
2905000	2906000	Right.
2906000	2910000	I believe that if you talk to a lot of junior faculty,
2910000	2914000	you will find that their life is actually very, very boring.
2914000	2915000	Okay.
2915000	2917000	It's usually a point-to-point life.
2917000	2920000	And what they do every day is basically the same.
2920000	2921000	Okay.
2921000	2924000	But it's because of these tedious processes.
2924000	2925000	Okay.
2925000	2926000	Causing this routine.
2926000	2927000	Okay.
2927000	2928000	Let them become a very disciplined person.
2928000	2929000	Okay.
2929000	2930000	That's because of these disciplines.
2930000	2934000	So that he can make a breakthrough in many aspects.
2934000	2935000	All right.
2935000	2936000	Okay.
2936000	2938000	So in the end, I hope to be able to use this.
2938000	2940000	Have a goal, have a discipline, have a plan.
2940000	2941000	Three yes.
2941000	2942000	To end today's speech.
2942000	2944000	If you have any questions,
2944000	2947000	I am more than happy to answer the question.
2947000	2948000	Thank you.
2949000	2952000	Thank you for Tai-Yan's sharing.
2952000	2954000	When I was listening just now,
2954000	2957000	I felt very agreeable.
2957000	2959000	It's like nodding your head.
2959000	2960000	Okay.
2960000	2963000	I want to reiterate some points.
2963000	2966000	Because I just got on the job.
2966000	2969000	I am also a junior faculty.
2969000	2972000	Tai-Yan just talked about these.
2972000	2974000	About presentation.
2974000	2975000	Of course,
2975000	2978000	Everyone is young.
2978000	2980000	When you are a Ph.D. student,
2980000	2982000	You have learned a lot of skills.
2982000	2984000	But we are more.
2984000	2986000	There is no point to pay attention to.
2986000	2987000	I think it is.
2987000	2990000	Eventually it will become a very important point.
2990000	2992000	Presentation and networking.
2992000	2994000	Tai-Yan just said.
2994000	2997000	There are some very practical practices.
2997000	3001000	Don't go to a conference without presentation.
3001000	3003000	I think this is very important.
3003000	3005000	How to interact with others in the conference.
3005000	3007000	It is a very important point.
3007000	3009000	Also,
3009000	3011000	Tai-Yan just mentioned.
3011000	3014000	The letter from your advisor carries a lot of weight.
3014000	3016000	I can't agree more.
3016000	3020000	Your advisor can push you up.
3020000	3022000	Can also push you down.
3022000	3025000	So this is a very important thing.
3025000	3028000	Do you have any questions here?
3028000	3031000	This is a fairly open space.
3031000	3033000	Everyone can ask any questions.
3033000	3037000	As long as you turn on the microphone.
3037000	3038000	By the way,
3038000	3043000	Patrick Winston's talk.
3043000	3051000	It was a reference when I was preparing my job talk.
3051000	3053000	How to speak.
3053000	3055000	YouTube video.
3055000	3056000	It is my reference.
3056000	3058000	I think he said very well.
3058000	3060000	Tai-Yan just said.
3060000	3065000	When you talk about presentation.
3065000	3069000	You have to talk to people outside your field.
3069000	3074000	My wife has heard my job talk hundreds of times.
3074000	3076000	So this is a very good way.
3076000	3078000	I can't agree more.
3078000	3080000	Do you have any questions?
3080000	3083000	You can just turn on the microphone and ask.
3091000	3093000	Can you hear me?
3093000	3095000	Yes, I can hear you.
3095000	3097000	Can you introduce yourself first?
3097000	3099000	I want to say that everyone is so shy.
3099000	3100000	Let me ask first.
3100000	3102000	I am Lin Zhanhong.
3102000	3105000	I am currently at the Leibniz Research Center in Germany.
3105000	3106000	PhD student.
3106000	3108000	It is currently the last year.
3108000	3110000	In the writing stage.
3110000	3112000	Thank you for your speech.
3112000	3115000	For the presentation and writing.
3115000	3118000	Whether it is thesis or paper part.
3118000	3119000	I think maybe.
3119000	3121000	This is what I can refer to at the moment.
3121000	3125000	Because I am currently writing my thesis.
3125000	3127000	In fact, I am more interested in asking the teacher.
3127000	3128000	I want to ask the teacher.
3128000	3131000	The first question is about cross-field.
3131000	3134000	Because I think the teacher seems to be from before.
3134000	3137000	By the way, I used to be a chemistry major.
3137000	3139000	So I should call it a senior.
3139000	3141000	Then I want to ask the teacher.
3141000	3144000	Because I see that your field seems to have changed a lot.
3144000	3147000	About this cross-field part.
3147000	3148000	The teacher just mentioned that maybe.
3148000	3150000	Enter a new field.
3150000	3152000	The fastest way is to put it first.
3152000	3155000	Find out the important fields in the first five years.
3155000	3156000	Then read it.
3156000	3157000	Then sort out your own summary.
3157000	3159000	But what I want to ask is that.
3159000	3161000	What is the teacher's opinion on this cross-field?
3161000	3165000	The teacher, do you think that in the original field.
3165000	3166000	I mean the cross-field is to say.
3166000	3168000	Is it a completely unrelated field?
3168000	3171000	Or is it a little bit combined?
3171000	3173000	But maybe.
3173000	3174000	There are some overlaps.
3174000	3175000	There are some overlaps.
3175000	3177000	But it may not be completely related.
3177000	3178000	Then I don't know the teacher.
3178000	3179000	I mainly want to ask the teacher.
3179000	3181000	What do you think about the cross-field?
3181000	3185000	It's about the advantages and disadvantages of future development.
3185000	3187000	Because the other one is to see.
3187000	3190000	The teacher's post-doc has also been doing it for a long time.
3190000	3194000	According to the academic world in Taiwan, as far as I know.
3194000	3198000	It seems to be too long.
3198000	3199000	So I just want to ask the teacher.
3199000	3202000	What do you think about these things?
3202000	3204000	I think about the cross-field.
3204000	3206000	I think I can be a representative of the cross-field.
3206000	3209000	Because the field is really quite wide.
3209000	3212000	From material chemistry.
3212000	3214000	Material physics.
3214000	3216000	Then it becomes biological physics.
3216000	3218000	To neurobiology.
3218000	3220000	In fact, it doesn't seem to have much to do with it.
3220000	3223000	So I think about the cross-field.
3223000	3224000	Is it good?
3224000	3225000	OK.
3225000	3228000	So what is everyone's approach?
3228000	3230000	It's usually not so exaggerated.
3230000	3233000	Mine is more like a 90-degree turn.
3233000	3235000	The general practice is probably.
3235000	3237000	It's amazing to turn 30 degrees.
3237000	3239000	That's a safer way.
3239000	3240000	OK.
3240000	3242000	Because basically.
3242000	3245000	I think even if you only turn 30 degrees.
3245000	3246000	OK.
3246000	3249000	Then expand your research scope.
3249000	3252000	This thing is actually quite difficult.
3252000	3253000	Yes.
3253000	3255000	What about the time?
3255000	3258000	Of course, it's a very, very important factor.
3258000	3259000	OK.
3259000	3263000	I think I can be a postdoc for so long.
3263000	3266000	The main reason is because.
3266000	3268000	I have a very supportive family.
3268000	3271000	With a very supportive advisor.
3271000	3272000	OK.
3272000	3274000	Inevitable.
3274000	3275000	If you say you are missing one.
3275000	3276000	It's not going to work.
3276000	3277000	OK.
3277000	3278000	You are going to live in hell.
3278000	3279000	OK.
3279000	3281000	So I don't recommend everyone.
3281000	3283000	Is to make such a drastic change.
3283000	3284000	Yes.
3284000	3286000	What are the benefits?
3286000	3288000	The benefit is that when you come to life.
3288000	3290000	You become very unique.
3290000	3291000	OK.
3291000	3293000	You can easily find some on research.
3293000	3294000	Scientific niche.
3294000	3296000	That you can be the only one.
3296000	3298000	Who can do this.
3298000	3299000	OK.
3299000	3302000	That will become a very good one.
3302000	3304000	If you can survive.
3304000	3306000	Then you can live relatively easily.
3306000	3309000	Because you start to define the field.
3309000	3310000	OK.
3310000	3311000	Because no one is doing that.
3311000	3312000	You are the only one.
3312000	3314000	Then you define the field.
3314000	3315000	Right.
3315000	3316000	If you are the first one.
3316000	3317000	Who define the field.
3317000	3319000	Then people follow you.
3319000	3320000	Then.
3320000	3322000	Things is actually easier.
3322000	3323000	OK.
3323000	3324000	But if you say.
3324000	3326000	You just follow the direction of others.
3326000	3327000	Then you will start.
3327000	3329000	You need to be very careful.
3329000	3330000	Because.
3330000	3332000	Whatever you say.
3332000	3333000	OK.
3333000	3334000	There will always be someone.
3334000	3335000	Researcher.
3335000	3336000	Start arguing with you.
3336000	3337000	Yes.
3337000	3338000	So.
3338000	3339000	The advantage of doing cross-field research is.
3339000	3340000	You may be easier to find.
3340000	3341000	A scientific niche.
3341000	3342000	To contribute.
3342000	3344000	What you have learned.
3344000	3346000	It is also easier to find new knowledge.
3346000	3347000	Come.
3347000	3349000	Push the front of the field.
3349000	3350000	OK.
3350000	3351000	So I think that is a big plus.
3351000	3352000	OK.
3352000	3354000	When doing this.
3354000	3355000	Because you changed the field.
3355000	3357000	The corresponding price is.
3357000	3359000	The cost of time.
3359000	3360000	OK.
3360000	3361000	The cost of time.
3361000	3362000	Can you accept it?
3362000	3365000	Can your family accept it?
3365000	3366000	Right.
3366000	3368000	Is your teacher willing to accept it?
3368000	3369000	Then this thing.
3369000	3371000	It becomes natural.
3371000	3372000	Like I said.
3372000	3373000	Like I said.
3373000	3374000	I think I am a lucky person.
3374000	3375000	Because.
3375000	3377000	My wife is very, very supportive.
3377000	3378000	OK.
3378000	3380000	My family is very, very, very supportive.
3380000	3381000	That.
3381000	3382000	My researcher boss.
3382000	3383000	I am a post office boss.
3383000	3384000	Tell me directly.
3384000	3385000	Wife, how long do you want to stay?
3385000	3386000	Yes.
3386000	3387000	So.
3387000	3388000	It creates a.
3388000	3389000	I think.
3389000	3390000	I can do this.
3390000	3391000	OK.
3391000	3392000	The point is.
3392000	3393000	When I do this.
3393000	3394000	How do I feel?
3394000	3396000	Do I still enjoy this process?
3396000	3398000	I think that's the point.
3398000	3400000	If I don't enjoy this process.
3400000	3402000	I have to force myself to turn around.
3402000	3404000	I think that's the meaning.
3404000	3405000	Right.
3405000	3406000	So.
3406000	3407000	Generally speaking.
3407000	3408000	I think.
3408000	3409000	If you really want to do cross-field.
3409000	3410000	Don't turn so much.
3410000	3411000	OK.
3411000	3412000	Turn 30 degrees.
3412000	3413000	OK.
3413000	3414000	It's quite similar to what you did before.
3414000	3416000	I think it's already a pretty good one.
3416000	3417000	Uh.
3417000	3419000	It should also be said that it is a more reasonable approach.
3419000	3420000	OK.
3420000	3422000	The feasibility is also a little higher.
3422000	3423000	OK.
3423000	3425000	Compared to your other requirements.
3425000	3426000	Maybe you can lose a little bit.
3426000	3427000	Then I think.
3427000	3428000	Is a good way.
3428000	3429000	Right.
3429000	3430000	That.
3430000	3431000	No.
3431000	3432000	There is another.
3432000	3433000	What other questions are there?
3433000	3434000	I said.
3434000	3435000	Is to.
3435000	3437000	Comment on the interdisciplinary research.
3437000	3438000	Then.
3438000	3439000	The general.
3439000	3440000	Thinking about.
3440000	3441000	The.
3441000	3442000	How you should actually do that.
3442000	3443000	So that.
3443000	3444000	You know.
3444000	3445000	It has a higher chance to.
3445000	3446000	Make it work.
3446000	3447000	OK.
3447000	3448000	So I think.
3448000	3449000	Don't turn too much.
3449000	3450000	That.
3450000	3451000	But you have to turn.
3451000	3452000	OK.
3452000	3453000	If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.
3453000	3454000	If you say you are doing the same thing all the time.
3454000	3455000	When you are looking for a teacher later.
3455000	3456000	You will definitely be asked the question.
3456000	3457000	Is.
3457000	3458000	How do you.
3458000	3459000	With your previous.
3459000	3460000	Uh.
3460000	3461000	PEI group.
3461000	3462000	Compete.
3462000	3463000	OK.
3463000	3464000	So I think the cross-field thing.
3464000	3465000	Must be done.
3465000	3466000	Because.
3466000	3467000	In the single field.
3467000	3468000	In fact.
3468000	3469000	Simple things.
3469000	3470000	Everyone is basically done.
3470000	3471000	Right.
3471000	3472000	Ah.
3472000	3473000	If it's too difficult.
3473000	3474000	When you start.
3474000	3475000	Your faculty position.
3475000	3476000	You don't have that much time to spend.
3476000	3477000	Right.
3477000	3478000	Right.
3478000	3479000	If you want to survive.
3479000	3480000	If.
3480000	3481000	I think.
3481000	3482000	That's not a good approach.
3482000	3483000	So.
3483000	3484000	Involve some new things.
3484000	3485000	I think it's a.
3486000	3487000	Good direction.
3487000	3488000	OK.
3488000	3489000	How much do you want to involve?
3489000	3490000	It depends on the individual's own conditions.
3490000	3491000	I hope this answer.
3491000	3492000	Yes, yes, yes.
3492000	3493000	I probably have some ideas.
3493000	3494000	That.
3494000	3495000	Another question.
3495000	3496000	I mainly want to ask the teacher.
3496000	3497000	That is.
3497000	3498000	About.
3498000	3499000	Uh.
3499000	3500000	Decide the academic world.
3500000	3501000	Stay in the academic world.
3501000	3502000	Continue to try.
3502000	3503000	Or.
3503000	3504000	Uh.
3504000	3505000	To go to the industry.
3505000	3506000	That.
3506000	3507000	This is.
3507000	3508000	Uh.
3508000	3509000	Uh.
3509000	3510000	Uh.
3510000	3511000	Uh.
3511000	3512000	Uh.
3512000	3513000	Uh.
3513000	3514000	Uh.
3514000	3515000	This time point.
3515000	3516000	With a change of mentality.
3516000	3517000	Is there any.
3517000	3518000	Is there.
3518000	3519000	The first one is.
3519000	3520000	Is there a clear time point?
3520000	3521000	That is.
3521000	3522000	When do you need.
3522000	3523000	Meta decision.
3523000	3524000	That's another one.
3524000	3525000	Is there anything.
3525000	3526000	How to say.
3526000	3527000	Is the point to be decided.
3527000	3528000	And the direction of the decision.
3528000	3529000	About.
3529000	3530000	This issue.
3530000	3531000	Is.
3531000	3532000	I don't know if the teacher has any suggestions.
3532000	3533000	I think.
3533000	3534000	Of course.
3534000	3535000	It's just me.
3535000	3536000	OK.
3536000	3537000	If.
3537000	3538000	You start looking for.
3539000	3540000	OK.
3540000	3541000	That.
3541000	3542000	When you're in the first year.
3542000	3543000	When.
3543000	3544000	If you say.
3544000	3545000	You have found the interview.
3545000	3546000	If the opportunity.
3546000	3547000	OK.
3547000	3548000	But you didn't go.
3548000	3549000	That.
3549000	3550000	The second year.
3550000	3551000	You have more interview opportunities.
3551000	3552000	But you haven't.
3552000	3553000	That.
3553000	3554000	I think you can.
3554000	3555000	Concede.
3555000	3556000	Turn to the industry.
3556000	3557000	That.
3557000	3558000	The reason I say that.
3558000	3559000	Mainly because.
3559000	3560000	In my opinion.
3560000	3561000	It's.
3561000	3562000	It's.
3562000	3563000	It's.
3563000	3564000	It's.
3564000	3565000	It's.
3565000	3566000	It's.
3566000	3567000	It's.
3567000	3568000	Mainly because.
3568000	3569000	In the example I see.
3569000	3570000	Once you.
3570000	3571000	Fail for twice.
3571000	3572000	OK.
3572000	3573000	You have to find another.
3573000	3574000	Uh.
3574000	3575000	Uh.
3575000	3576000	Uh.

3579000	3580000	Uh.
3580000	3581000	Uh.
3581000	3582000	Uh.
3582000	3583000	Uh.
3583000	3584000	Uh.
3584000	3585000	Uh.

3592000	3593000	Uh.
3593000	3594000	Uh.
3594000	3595000	Uh.
3595000	3596000	Uh.
3596000	3597000	Uh.
3597000	3598000	Uh.
3598000	3599000	Uh.
3599000	3600000	Uh.
3600000	3601000	Uh.
3603000	3604000	Uh.
3604000	3605000	Uh.
3605000	3606000	Uh.
3606000	3607000	Uh.
3607000	3608000	Uh.
3608000	3609000	Uh.
3609000	3610000	Uh.
3610000	3611000	Uh.
3611000	3612000	Uh.
3612000	3613000	Uh.
3613000	3614000	Uh.
3614000	3615000	Uh.
3615000	3616000	Uh.
3616000	3617000	Uh.
3617000	3618000	Uh.
3618000	3619000	Uh.
3619000	3620000	Uh.
3620000	3621000	Uh.
3621000	3622000	Uh.
3622000	3623000	Uh.
3623000	3624000	Uh.
3624000	3625000	Uh.
3625000	3626000	Uh.
3626000	3627000	Uh.
3627000	3628000	Uh.
3628000	3629000	Uh.
3630000	3634000	So my personal feeling, again, my personal feeling.
3634000	3647000	If you are in the second year, if you have the opportunity to interview for the second time, but you still don't have the position, then I guess that maybe there are some things that we did not realize, but other, uh.
3647000	3648000	Uh.
3648000	3656000	Uh, so the committee that you see might be a problem, so I think it might be a matter of whether to think about whether to change the career path that would be more suitable for yourself.
3656000	3671000	Ok, after all, uh, I just talked to everybody. Ok, this matter of education is actually the condition itself. Of course, it's important, but we all think it's great, it's almost 50 percent.
3671000	3677000	The other 50 percent is more related to the formation of the committee of the direction of the department.
3677000	3683000	So if you say that it's not very smooth when you're looking for a teacher, you don't have to be too depressed.
3683000	3688000	You just didn't meet the right search committee at the right time.
3688000	3693000	Ok, then the department did not provide you with the direction of the department and your direction did not match.
3693000	3702000	Ok, it's less simple. It's not that you are not good enough. Ok, so I think the change in mentality does not have to be denied.
3702000	3708000	Ok, then I think that if you want to consider it bad luck, I think it's totally fine.
3708000	3712000	Ok, it's really just that this thing is too complicated and involves too many factors.
3712000	3718000	Ok, it's not that I'm going to do my best and I'm going to have a position, it's not like that.
3719000	3724000	Yes, I have a lot of friends who perform better than me in science.
3724000	3727000	In the end, they just don't have a position.
3727000	3731000	Then you would say that I am better than them. I don't think so either.
3731000	3736000	They just don't have the position they want when they vote.
3736000	3739000	That fit is not very good.
3739000	3744000	Then this kind of person goes to the industry, I think they will be crazy, because they are really good.
3745000	3753000	So I think that if you say that you are not good at the academic world and transfer to the industry, I don't think it's a sad thing.
3753000	3759000	I don't think it's necessary, because you have a very good platform that can really let you shine.
3764000	3769000	Ok, thank you for your answer. I think maybe let everyone ask.
3774000	3775000	Do you have any questions?
3775000	3777000	I very much agree.
3777000	3786000	When we were just talking about finding a faculty position, the component of luck is really big.
3786000	3792000	In addition to the search committee of the other school, who will compete with you that year?
3792000	3795000	This thing is also different every year.
3795000	3807000	Can I comment on the search committee?
3807000	3810000	We just talked about outreach.
3810000	3814000	At the beginning, we were focusing on graduate student outreach, right?
3814000	3818000	You have to do this more thoroughly when you are a postdoc.
3818000	3823000	Because you need more recognition letters.
3823000	3827000	So you really need to get to know the people in your field.
3827000	3830000	It will make it easier for you when you are a postdoc.
3830000	3832000	That's right.
3837000	3839000	It seems that someone just wanted to ask a question.
3839000	3840000	Is it?
3840000	3842000	Hello, I am.
3842000	3846000	I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the United States.
3846000	3849000	I have been studying for four years.
3850000	3853000	I think what I just shared is a lot of success.
3853000	3860000	Mainly because I am now in a research proposal stage.
3860000	3870000	What I want to ask is how to set the vision goal when writing a proposal.
3870000	3874000	I don't want it to be too big that I can't control it.
3874000	3879000	But I don't want it to be too small that there is no room for it.
3879000	3883000	I want to set a goal and a vision.
3883000	3890000	My main career goal is to achieve my goal.
3890000	3894000	If that's the case, what should I set?
3894000	3899000	A PSD proposal goal and vision.
3900000	3904000	I think this should be your boss's job.
3909000	3919000	My suggestion is to write out the outline first.
3919000	3923000	Then discuss it with your teacher.
3924000	3928000	The teacher will provide some reasonable judgment.
3928000	3931000	After all, it's your major.
3931000	3935000	It's hard for me to give you meaningful comments here.
3935000	3942000	But I think in general, I will ask my students to show me what they think.
3942000	3948000	Let's discuss and see if what you think is reasonable.
3949000	3958000	I think you need to practice more on writing outlines.
3958000	3964000	Think about your significance.
3964000	3968000	When you write something, is it significant?
3968000	3974000	In the end, when you write a proposal, significance is the most important factor.
3974000	3977000	After thinking about your significance,
3977000	3980000	How do you approach this problem?
3980000	3986000	It's worth thinking about.
3986000	3991000	I think the earlier you write out your outline,
3991000	3997000	It's best to discuss with your teacher as soon as possible.
3997000	4003000	Because your teacher can make the most reasonable comment about your research significance.
4003000	4005000	If your teacher doesn't think your significance is high,
4005000	4008000	I think you can change the topic as soon as possible.
4008000	4018000	I think writing a proposal is something you might want to specialize in later.
4018000	4027000	I don't think many doctoral students have the experience of writing a proposal.
4027000	4035000	I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.
4035000	4041000	If you have a chance, I suggest you try to write a proposal.
4041000	4047000	When you're writing your proposal experiment,
4047000	4050000	There's a little bit of that feeling.
4050000	4054000	I think you can take this opportunity to make it more complete.
4054000	4058000	I think writing a proposal is a very helpful experience for your future research significance.
4058000	4062000	Is that okay?
4062000	4065000	Yes, thank you.
4065000	4068000	I have another question.
4068000	4076000	How independent should PhD students be?
4076000	4090000	How independent should PhD students be?
4090000	4093000	This is related to PhDs.
4093000	4095000	Every lab is different.
4095000	4101000	But I found one thing.
4101000	4106000	I think teachers and students need some time to build their mutual trust.
4106000	4108000	If you have mutual trust,
4108000	4114000	I think if you want to provide enough evidence to support your argument,
4114000	4119000	The boss usually won't be too strongly opposed.
4119000	4122000	If the boss has a strong desire to oppose what you propose,
4122000	4128000	That means you haven't reached that level in his heart.
4128000	4131000	How do you build mutual trust?
4131000	4138000	I think it's very important to have the ability to experiment.
4138000	4144000	And can you clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do?
4144000	4150000	If you can clearly express that you are highly professional in what you do,
4150000	4155000	Even if the project doesn't work, the teacher is still willing to trust you.
4155000	4160000	So I think it takes some incubation time to build that trust.
4160000	4171000	That incubation time depends on whether the students are really professional when presenting their results.
4171000	4177000	I think it's usually the general teacher.
4177000	4179000	Of course, some teachers are exceptions.
4179000	4184000	If the general teacher sees that students can really be responsible for what they do,
4184000	4189000	And can really make things clear, complete and reasonable,
4189000	4194000	Then I guess if you want to do a new project in the lab later,
4194000	4197000	Or if you come up with something and you want to continue,
4197000	4200000	The teacher will have a higher chance of agreeing.
4200000	4204000	Otherwise, in fact, on the practical operating surface,
4204000	4210000	The problem is that the teacher's funding is actually for specific projects.
4211000	4213000	So sometimes they can't deviate.
4213000	4219000	If you propose a proposal and it deviates too far from the original proposal,
4219000	4222000	He may not be able to provide financial support.
4222000	4227000	It's not that he doesn't trust you, he just doesn't have the potential.
4227000	4230000	Does that make sense?
4230000	4232000	Yes, yes, yes.
4232000	4234000	Thank you very much.
4234000	4236000	Then my question ends here.
4240000	4243000	Okay, everyone should have heard me talk just now.
4243000	4246000	That's the end of our Q&A session.
4246000	4249000	Then everyone will turn on the microphone again.
4249000	4252000	Let's applaud and thank Taiyan.
4252000	4254000	Thank you, everyone.
4254000	4256000	Thank you, everyone.
