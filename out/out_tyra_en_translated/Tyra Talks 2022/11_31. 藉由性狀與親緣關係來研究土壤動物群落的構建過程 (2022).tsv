0	7500	From now on, we'll move on to the recording part.
7500	12000	We'll put this speech on YouTube as well.
12000	14500	Please go there to replay it.
14500	19500	Ding, please share your screen.
19500	22500	Okay, before I share my screen,
22500	24500	let me tell you who I am.
24500	25500	I'm Chen Dingwen.
25500	27000	Thank you for the introduction.
27000	31500	I'm Dingwen Zhang, also known as Chen Dingwen.
31500	36000	I'm a post-doctoral researcher at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany.
36000	40000	I think TARA is an interesting organization.
40000	43000	I like its purpose and purpose.
43000	46000	It's to help young people in Taiwan
46000	49000	and young scholars to have a platform
49000	51500	where we can communicate with each other
51500	53500	and get to know what everyone is busy with
53500	56500	and what research they're doing.
56500	59500	Why do I know about TARA?
59500	62000	It's because I saw it on Facebook.
62000	63500	I don't know why, but one day,
63500	65000	this ad popped up and I thought,
65000	68000	is this a young scholar from Taiwan?
68000	70500	It's T-Y-R-A.
70500	73500	A is association, R is researcher.
73500	76000	T-Y-Y is what?
76000	77500	Young scientist?
77500	78500	Young researcher.
78500	80000	Y is young.
80000	82000	T is Taiwan.
82000	84500	I thought, as a young scholar from Taiwan,
84500	88500	I should join a group like this.
88500	90500	When I was a kid,
90500	95000	I spent most of my high school and college years in Taiwan.
95000	97000	I only had the chance to do research in Europe
97000	99000	when I was a doctor.
99000	102500	To me, TARA is a whole new world.
102500	105000	I know that most of TARA's members
105000	107000	are from the U.S.
107000	110000	I wanted to meet friends from the U.S.
110000	114000	to see if they were doing ecological research like me
114000	117500	or if they were interested in soil,
117500	120000	or if they were doing research on evolution.
120000	121500	I really wanted to meet these people,
121500	124500	so I joined this group and joined their activities.
124500	128000	For example, they have a teacher-student program.
128000	133500	In this program, they help young people in Taiwan
133500	137500	and those of us who have gone abroad to study.
137500	141500	We help them on their way to study abroad,
141500	144000	so that they can make a difference.
144000	147000	We can also share with them
147000	150000	what we have learned and experienced
150000	153000	during our journey of studying abroad.
153000	156000	So that they don't go down the wrong path
156000	158000	or find a better way
158000	161000	to explore their future career development.
161000	162000	OK.
162000	165000	This is a brief introduction to TARA.
165000	168000	I'm going to start my speech.
168500	170500	I don't want to make this
170500	174500	a formal and serious presentation.
174500	177500	If you have any questions
177500	180500	during my presentation,
180500	182500	you can ask me anytime.
182500	183500	Of course, I know that
183500	185500	there may not be any formal questions.
185500	187500	I also have a small request.
187500	189500	If you don't mind,
189500	191500	could you please turn on your camera
191500	193500	so that I can see your faces?
193500	194500	OK.
195000	196000	If you don't mind,
196000	198000	could you please turn on your camera
198000	200000	so that I can see your faces?
200000	202000	I want to know if you find this part
202000	204000	particularly difficult to understand,
204000	206000	or if you find this part particularly boring,
206000	208000	or if you find this part particularly interesting.
208000	210000	I can explain further.
210000	212000	If you don't mind,
212000	214000	could you please turn on your camera
214000	216000	so that I can see your faces?
216000	217000	OK.
217000	219000	I'm going to start my speech.
219000	221000	First, I'm going to share my screen.
221500	223500	I'm going to try to
223500	225500	I'm going to try to
225500	227500	make good use of my time.
227500	229500	I know that we only have one hour today.
229500	231500	What do you see now?
231500	233500	Do you see
233500	235500	the screen that I'm sharing?
235500	237500	Lin, do you see the screen
237500	239500	that I'm sharing?
239500	241500	Lin, do you see the screen
241500	243500	that I'm sharing?
243500	245500	Lin, do you see the screen
245500	247500	that I'm sharing?
247500	249500	OK.
250000	252000	What you see now is
252000	254000	the structure of the root of the plant
254000	256000	under the ground.
256000	258000	When you zoom in,
258000	260000	what do you see?
260000	262000	Have you ever thought about this question?
262000	264000	Are there any creatures
264000	266000	that we don't know
266000	268000	or haven't seen?
268000	270000	I'm a soil ecologist.
270000	272000	I'm particularly interested
272000	274000	in the evolution of
274000	276000	soil animals.
276000	278000	At the same time,
278500	280500	I'm a mentor.
280500	282500	I'm a mentor.
282500	284500	I joined Taira's
284500	286500	mentor project.
286500	288500	I also teach some college students,
288500	290500	even PhD students.
290500	292500	I'm also a podcaster.
292500	294500	I'm actually running a podcast
294500	296500	in 2020.
296500	298500	It's a bit scientific,
298500	300500	but it's called
300500	302500	Do You Read Paper?
302500	304500	It's about soil ecology.
304500	306500	Some of you may know me
307000	309000	and I'm glad you can
309000	311000	participate in my speech
311000	313000	and listen to me
313000	315000	share my work and learning process.
317000	319000	This is a typical
319000	321000	mountainous forest
321000	323000	in Europe.
323000	325000	If I tell you
325000	327000	that there are
327000	329000	thousands of
329000	331000	animals in this forest,
331000	333000	what can you see
333000	335000	from this photo?
335500	337500	In fact, you can't see them.
337500	339500	Where are they?
339500	341500	They live
341500	343500	in these fallen leaves
343500	345500	and in the soil
345500	347500	below the fallen leaves.
347500	349500	If you dig
349500	351500	a piece of soil,
351500	353500	you can see
353500	355500	the surface of the soil.
355500	357500	It's about 5 cm wide
357500	359500	and 5 cm deep.
359500	361500	5 to 10 cm.
361500	363500	In such a small space,
364000	366000	you can see
366000	368000	a maze-like structure.
368000	370000	You can see
370000	372000	the fallen leaves
372000	374000	at the top
374000	376000	and the solid soil
376000	378000	at the bottom.
378000	380000	In such a small space,
380000	382000	it will produce some
382000	384000	environmental kinks.
384000	386000	For example,
386000	388000	water has a kink.
388000	390000	When rainwater falls,
390000	392000	the fallen leaves are wet
392500	394500	and the soil is full of nutrients.
394500	396500	In such a small space,
396500	398500	which is very different
398500	400500	in terms of
400500	402500	geological value and
402500	404500	environment,
404500	406500	it can accommodate
406500	408500	all kinds of
408500	410500	different creatures.
410500	412500	We call such a space
412500	414500	a soil.
414500	416500	But in academia,
416500	418500	we will also use
418500	420500	a term called
421000	423000	detritivores.
423000	425000	We will assume that
425000	427000	it eats these
427000	429000	plants and animals.
429000	431000	So it is also called
431000	433000	a ten-year-old detritivores.
433000	435000	Living in
435000	437000	this
437000	439000	maze
439000	441000	or fallen leaves,
441000	443000	you can
443000	445000	think about
445000	447000	how many of these
447000	449000	animals
449500	451500	can survive
451500	453500	in a square meter
453500	455500	of soil.
455500	457500	We can see
457500	459500	10,000 to
459500	461500	2 million detritivores.
461500	463500	This is an amazing number.
463500	465500	Think about how many grains
465500	467500	you eat a day.
467500	469500	But in such a
469500	471500	small space,
471500	473500	you can see
473500	475500	so many individual animals.
475500	477500	How many of these
478000	480000	animals can survive
480000	482000	in a square meter of
482000	484000	Wendai Forest?
484000	486000	Most of these
486000	488000	detritivores are very small.
488000	490000	Although the size of
490000	492000	their body is large,
492000	494000	most of them are
494000	496000	smaller than 1 cm.
496000	498000	Of course, there are also
498000	500000	centipedes, centipedes,
500000	502000	and spiders that
502000	504000	are larger than 1 cm.
504000	506000	We generally call
506500	508500	small centipedes
508500	510500	and small centipedes
510500	512500	as small centipedes.
512500	514500	However,
514500	516500	there are also
516500	518500	small centipedes
518500	520500	that are smaller
520500	522500	than 1 cm.
522500	524500	For example,
524500	526500	the centipede
526500	528500	is a small centipede,
528500	530500	which is
530500	532500	a small centipede.
532500	534500	We call it
535000	537000	a small centipede.
537000	539000	However,
539000	541000	also there are
541000	543000	medium and
543000	545000	medium-sized animals.
545000	547000	Why is it important?
547000	549000	Because when you
549000	551000	study animals,
551000	553000	the first thing
553000	555000	you will learn is
555000	557000	how to classify them
557000	559000	according to their size.
559000	561000	Medium-sized,
561000	563000	large-sized,
563000	565000	and medium-sized.
565000	567000	In addition,
567000	569000	you can see these
569000	571000	are also medium-sized.
571000	573000	There are some special ones
573000	575000	like centipedes,
575000	577000	centipedes,
577000	579000	and synphyrenes,
579000	581000	polyporynes,
581000	583000	and scorpions.
583000	585000	I will not explain
585000	587000	the term here,
587000	589000	otherwise we may not have enough time today.
589000	591000	What other medium-sized animals
591000	593000	like centipedes and
593000	595000	centipedes are?
595000	597000	They are also medium-sized animals.
597000	599000	I like
599000	601000	centipedes very much.
601000	603000	What is a centipede?
603000	605000	You should listen to my podcast.
605000	607000	It should be in the fourth episode.
607000	609000	I have introduced
609000	611000	a science book on centipedes.
611000	613000	Let me explain it to you.
613000	615000	Centipedes are not
615000	617000	centipedes.
617000	619000	Centipedes are not insects.
619000	621000	Strictly speaking,
621000	623000	centipedes are not insects.
623000	625000	Centipedes can be considered
625000	627000	one of the six main species.
627000	629000	Centipedes are now classified
629000	631000	as spiny centipedes.
631000	633000	In the past, centipedes were classified as spiny centipedes.
633000	635000	Centipedes are now classified as spiny centipedes.
635000	637000	Therefore, centipedes are the
637000	639000	close relatives of insects.
639000	641000	How long has centipedes
641000	643000	existed in the history of
643000	645000	chemistry and evolution?
645000	647000	Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.
647000	649000	Centipedes have existed since the ancient times.
649000	651000	Centipedes are one of the
651000	653000	first species of centipedes
653000	655000	that came to the earth.
655000	657000	Centipedes are one of the first species of centipedes
657000	659000	that came to the earth.
659000	661000	There are 9,000 species of centipedes in the world.
661000	663000	We can classify them into
663000	665000	four different species,
665000	667000	30 different species.
667000	669000	The first species is
669000	671000	Entomorphia.
671000	673000	It is a more obvious species.
673000	675000	It is a more obvious species.
675000	677000	Most of them live on the surface.
677000	679000	Most of them live on the surface.
679000	681000	Centipedes are
681000	683000	more expressive.
683000	685000	Most of their food
685000	687000	comes from plants.
687000	689000	Most of their food comes from plants.
689000	691000	Another species is
691000	693000	Podromorpha.
693000	695000	This species has a more variable shape.
695000	697000	Compared to the centipede
697000	699000	Entomorphia,
699000	701000	Podromorpha has a shorter spring.
701000	703000	I will talk about the spring later.
703000	705000	Podromorpha is a species
705000	707000	that lives in the soil.
707000	709000	that lives in the soil.
709000	711000	It does not need to use spring.
711000	713000	It does not need to use spring.
713000	715000	Most of the spring of Podromorpha
715000	717000	is relatively short.
717000	719000	There is also Nenepleona
719000	721000	and Simipleona.
721000	723000	These two species of centipedes
723000	725000	are round and look like mice.
725000	727000	I remember a classmate
727000	729000	who likes to study Simipleona.
729000	731000	I remember a classmate
731000	733000	And a Taiwanese student
733000	735000	studying the centipedes
735000	737000	at a teacher's lab.
737000	739000	He specially studied the Simipleona,
739000	741000	who has symptoms
741000	743000	of this wood plant.
743000	745000	The centipede
745000	747000	was very cute.
747000	749000	Centipedes live onLAUND very cutely
749000	751000	and grows on the surface.
751000	753000	But the Nenepleona
753000	755000	looks like the Centipedes,
755000	757000	but sticks out.
757000	759000	So they mostly grow
759000	761000	on the surface.
761000	763000	The centipede
763000	765000	has an important feature.
765000	767000	Can you see my sign?
767000	769000	I hope you can see it.
769000	771000	The centipede jumps
771000	773000	because it has a
773000	775000	bouncy structure
775000	777000	at its butt.
777000	779000	This bouncy structure
779000	781000	helps it resist
781000	783000	the attack of the centipede.
783000	785000	So this thing
785000	787000	can make it leave
787000	789000	its original position.
789000	791000	That's why it's called a centipede.
791000	793000	What does a centipede do?
793000	795000	Centipedes have
795000	797000	the ability to regulate
797000	799000	microorganisms in the ecosystem.
799000	801000	Centipedes can also
801000	803000	affect the group of soil
803000	805000	or promote
805000	807000	or change the
807000	809000	fallout in the soil.
809000	811000	It also affects the
811000	813000	chemical cycle of the soil
813000	815000	and helps the plants.
815000	817000	The role of the centipede
817000	819000	in the ecosystem
819000	821000	is not only to be a
821000	823000	nourisher,
823000	825000	but also to be a
825000	827000	separator.
827000	829000	The centipede can be
829000	831000	a primary decomposer
831000	833000	and a secondary decomposer.
833000	835000	In addition to being
835000	837000	a primary decomposer
837000	839000	and a secondary decomposer,
839000	841000	some centipedes can also
841000	843000	be a nourisher.
843000	845000	Centipedes can also be
845000	847000	a nourisher
847000	849000	in the soil.
849000	851000	For example,
851000	853000	some spiders or
853000	855000	nourishing ants can eat centipedes.
855000	857000	Centipedes have a softer body
857000	859000	compared to
859000	861000	other ants.
861000	863000	Their body is softer,
863000	865000	so centipedes are
865000	867000	more delicious than
867000	869000	other hard ants.
869000	871000	Nourishing ants, spiders, ants, etc.
871000	873000	They are also considered
873000	875000	as food for other species.
875000	877000	So,
877000	879000	this is the first part.
879000	881000	I promised you half of the science,
881000	883000	and the other half is
883000	885000	half of the academic.
885000	887000	OK, do you have any questions?
887000	889000	Let me see if there are
889000	891000	people I know online.
891000	893000	Oh, I see some people I know.
893000	895000	I'd like to say hello to all of you.
895000	897000	If I didn't have time to say hello just now.
897000	899000	Okay, I'll stop here.
899000	901000	If you have any questions,
901000	903000	or if you don't understand
903000	905000	what I'm saying,
905000	907000	please feel free to
907000	909000	ask now.
909000	911000	I'll give you about
911000	913000	one minute to ask.
913000	915000	Does it look like there are no questions?
915000	917000	OK.
917000	919000	Let's continue.
919000	921000	Why do we want to know
921000	923000	about
923000	925000	centipedes?
925000	927000	Since centipedes
927000	929000	are very important
929000	931000	to the ecosystem,
931000	933000	why do we want to know
933000	935000	about centipedes?
935000	937000	Because centipedes
937000	939000	are very important
939000	941000	to the ecosystem.
941000	943000	Of course, centipedes
943000	945000	have a certain impact
945000	947000	on the ecosystem,
947000	949000	but we don't know
949000	951000	enough about them.
951000	953000	So we want to know
953000	955000	who they are,
955000	957000	why they are here,
957000	959000	and why these species
959000	961000	can survive here.
961000	963000	Why it's them,
963000	965000	not others?
965000	967000	In 1975,
967000	969000	Anderson
969000	971000	came up with an explanation
971000	973000	to explain why
973000	975000	there are so many
975000	977000	centipedes in the soil.
977000	979000	Why are there so many centipedes
979000	981000	in the soil?
981000	983000	As I said,
983000	985000	there are tens of thousands
985000	987000	of centipedes per square meter.
987000	989000	Why are there so many
989000	991000	centipedes in the soil?
991000	993000	Why are there so many centipedes
993000	995000	in the soil?
995000	997000	He summed up
997000	999000	that there are a lot of food resources
999000	1001000	in the soil.
1001000	1003000	Second, we don't know
1003000	1005000	what they eat.
1005000	1007000	They eat different kinds of food.
1007000	1009000	Third, the soil
1009000	1011000	has a high level of environmental sustainability.
1011000	1013000	This was his idea
1013000	1015000	in 1975.
1015000	1017000	Now it's 2022,
1017000	1019000	almost 50 years later.
1019000	1021000	What have we learned?
1021000	1023000	How far has the research
1023000	1025000	progressed in the past 50 years?
1025000	1027000	Is there any new hypothesis
1027000	1029000	or new technology
1029000	1031000	that can help us
1031000	1033000	answer the question
1033000	1035000	why there are so many
1035000	1037000	centipedes in the soil?
1037000	1039000	Why are there so many
1039000	1041000	centipedes in the soil?
1041000	1043000	If you dig a soil
1043000	1045000	and put it under a microscope,
1045000	1047000	you can see
1047000	1049000	centipedes,
1049000	1051000	centipedes,
1051000	1053000	centipedes,
1053000	1055000	and centipedes.
1055000	1057000	Ecology tells us
1057000	1059000	that if you study biology in college,
1059000	1061000	you may learn about
1061000	1063000	ecology, biophysics,
1063000	1065000	and biophysics.
1065000	1067000	Can we use the knowledge
1067000	1069000	we learn
1069000	1071000	or the knowledge
1071000	1073000	we learn in school
1073000	1075000	to explain the phenomenon
1075000	1077000	we see?
1077000	1079000	This is my research.
1079000	1081000	I study the biological geography
1081000	1083000	and their evolution
1083000	1085000	in the ecology of centipedes.
1085000	1087000	The question asked in the biological geography
1087000	1089000	is what is the distribution pattern?
1089000	1091000	Is the biological geography
1091000	1093000	from low to high
1093000	1095000	along a certain gradient?
1095000	1097000	For example, along the gradient of the sea level,
1097000	1099000	along the gradient of temperature,
1099000	1101000	along the gradient of water.
1101000	1103000	This is the issue
1103000	1105000	that biological geography deals with.
1105000	1107000	What is the issue
1107000	1109000	that the ecology of centipedes deals with?
1109000	1111000	What is the interaction effect?
1111000	1113000	Do they have some special features
1113000	1115000	that can help them live in that place?
1115000	1117000	What do they eat
1117000	1119000	to maintain their species?
1119000	1121000	The third issue
1121000	1123000	is the evolution of biology.
1123000	1125000	The question asked in the evolution of biology
1125000	1127000	is what is the origin of biodiversity?
1127000	1129000	How do these diversities
1129000	1131000	come from?
1131000	1133000	Do they change from less to more
1133000	1135000	or from more to less?
1135000	1137000	What changes
1137000	1139000	besides the shape of the body
1139000	1141000	and the different features?
1141000	1143000	Do they have some genetic basis?
1143000	1145000	Is this related
1145000	1147000	to the interrelationship
1147000	1149000	between species?
1149000	1151000	Can the organism
1151000	1153000	create or develop
1153000	1155000	its own niche,
1155000	1157000	its own ecological position,
1157000	1159000	its own opportunity
1159000	1161000	to reproduce more
1161000	1163000	or to diversify?
1163000	1165000	This is the content of the evolution of biology.
1165000	1167000	I'm using
1167000	1169000	a framework
1169000	1171000	called CTPE,
1171000	1173000	Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.
1173000	1175000	In Chinese, it stands for
1175000	1177000	Community Trade and Phylogenetic Ecology.
1177000	1179000	This is actually
1179000	1181000	a more comprehensive discipline.
1181000	1183000	It requires knowledge
1183000	1185000	other than the traditional
1185000	1187000	community ecology.
1187000	1189000	It also requires the concept of
1189000	1191000	evolution of biology
1191000	1193000	or system development of biology.
1193000	1195000	How does it study?
1195000	1197000	Assuming that
1197000	1199000	you can see the composition
1199000	1201000	of different species
1201000	1203000	on an environmental scale.
1203000	1205000	You will see
1205000	1207000	certain characteristics
1207000	1209000	of these species
1209000	1211000	in observation,
1211000	1213000	so you can
1213000	1215000	divide them into different species.
1215000	1217000	We will infer
1217000	1219000	the characteristics of
1219000	1221000	these species,
1221000	1223000	and assess
1223000	1225000	what happened to them.
1225000	1227000	Are there any processes
1227000	1229000	that lead to
1229000	1231000	the results you see now?
1231000	1233000	What are these processes?
1233000	1235000	There is a book in 2016
1235000	1237000	written by
1237000	1239000	Mark Barron.
1239000	1241000	It is about the theory of
1241000	1243000	ecological communities.
1243000	1245000	In this theory,
1245000	1247000	he tells us that
1247000	1249000	the structure of the community
1249000	1251000	is made up of
1251000	1253000	four main processes.
1253000	1255000	The first process
1255000	1257000	is the selection process.
1257000	1259000	It is also called
1259000	1261000	the filtering process.
1261000	1263000	The second process is
1263000	1265000	the drift process.
1265000	1267000	It is a random process
1267000	1269000	that affects
1269000	1271000	a small group of species.
1271000	1273000	The third process is
1273000	1275000	the dispersion process.
1275000	1277000	The reason why the species
1277000	1279000	are divided into four
1279000	1281000	processes is because
1281000	1283000	the species are
1283000	1285000	divided into three
1285000	1287000	processes.
1287000	1289000	The fourth process is
1289000	1291000	the seeding process.
1291000	1293000	In my view,
1293000	1295000	a group of species
1295000	1297000	is mainly affected
1297000	1299000	by these four processes.
1299000	1301000	It is not what you see now.
1301000	1303000	The ecological processes
1303000	1305000	you see now
1305000	1307000	are the results of
1307000	1309000	the filtering process.
1309000	1311000	If you see that
1311000	1313000	the shape of a group of species
1313000	1315000	is very different,
1315000	1317000	it is the result of
1317000	1319000	the dispersion process.
1319000	1321000	It sounds logical,
1321000	1323000	so it can be done.
1323000	1325000	Let's take a look at
1325000	1327000	the results of my
1327000	1329000	previous research
1329000	1331000	on land animals.
1331000	1333000	The filtering process
1333000	1335000	plays a role in
1335000	1337000	the group of species we study.
1337000	1339000	Here are two examples.
1339000	1341000	One is a worm,
1341000	1343000	and the other is an ant in a jar.
1343000	1345000	This is a study
1345000	1347000	we did in Changbai Mountain,
1347000	1349000	Northeastern China.
1349000	1351000	We surveyed
1351000	1353000	the growth of
1353000	1355000	a species in a group of worms
1355000	1357000	along 10 different heights.
1357000	1359000	We looked at the shape of
1359000	1361000	its body,
1361000	1363000	and the proportion of
1363000	1365000	the dark and light colors
1365000	1367000	in the group.
1367000	1369000	We found that
1369000	1371000	the higher the height,
1371000	1373000	the lower the amount
1373000	1375000	of egg in the soil.
1375000	1377000	The higher the height,
1377000	1379000	the lower the amount
1379000	1381000	of egg in the soil,
1381000	1383000	and the darker the color
1383000	1385000	in the worm group.
1385000	1387000	The color of the body
1387000	1389000	is an important shape
1389000	1391000	of the worm.
1391000	1393000	This is the reason
1393000	1395000	why the color of the worm
1395000	1397000	is different.
1397000	1399000	Another example is
1399000	1401000	a project I'm doing
1401000	1403000	in the tourism area
1403000	1405000	in Indonesia.
1405000	1407000	This is a project
1407000	1409000	we did two or three years ago.
1409000	1411000	We surveyed ants in jars
1411000	1413000	and collected them
1413000	1415000	in a sprayer.
1415000	1417000	We looked at the characteristics
1417000	1419000	of ants in jars
1419000	1421000	and collected them
1421000	1423000	in a sprayer.
1423000	1425000	We found that
1425000	1427000	in four different environments,
1427000	1429000	such as tropical rainforests,
1429000	1431000	rainforests,
1431000	1433000	rubber fields,
1433000	1435000	rubber fields,
1435000	1437000	and zoological gardens,
1437000	1439000	the characteristics of ants
1439000	1441000	in jars
1441000	1443000	and their
1443000	1445000	habitat patterns
1445000	1447000	were selected by the environment.
1447000	1449000	This is the pattern.
1449000	1451000	How did the environment come about?
1451000	1453000	The degree of degradation of the environment
1453000	1455000	was caused by man-made development
1455000	1457000	and the way the land was used.
1457000	1459000	As a result,
1459000	1461000	these special-shaped ants
1461000	1463000	were selected.
1463000	1465000	You can see the shape
1465000	1467000	of these species.
1467000	1469000	In addition to the color of the body,
1469000	1471000	what else can you see?
1471000	1473000	The size of the body
1473000	1475000	and the shape of the body.
1475000	1477000	To put it simply,
1477000	1479000	we can divide the shape
1479000	1481000	into two different categories.
1481000	1483000	One is called Beta-nitrate
1483000	1485000	and the other is called Alpha-nitrate.
1485000	1487000	Beta-nitrate refers to those
1487000	1489000	that are related to the environment,
1489000	1491000	such as the durability of the environment,
1491000	1493000	such as the color of the body.
1493000	1495000	You can think of it
1495000	1497000	as a Beta-nitrate.
1497000	1499000	In addition,
1499000	1501000	the shape of Alpha-nitrate
1501000	1503000	is related to the way
1503000	1505000	the ants feed.
1505000	1507000	This is related to the way
1507000	1509000	they use resources.
1509000	1511000	If you observe the shape
1511000	1513000	of a species in a group,
1513000	1515000	there may be similarities
1515000	1517000	and there may not be similarities.
1517000	1519000	You can see that
1519000	1521000	there are three groups
1521000	1523000	in the three boxes on the right.
1523000	1525000	Take a closer look
1525000	1527000	at which ones are similar
1527000	1529000	and which ones are not.
1529000	1531000	The shape of the three ants
1531000	1533000	in the three boxes on the right
1533000	1535000	is the same,
1535000	1537000	but the color is different.
1537000	1539000	Take a closer look
1539000	1541000	at the size of the body.
1541000	1543000	The size of the three ants
1543000	1545000	in the three boxes on the right
1545000	1547000	is the same,
1547000	1549000	but the color is different.
1549000	1551000	You can see that
1551000	1553000	if you observe its shape,
1553000	1555000	you can deduce that
1555000	1557000	in addition to filtering,
1557000	1559000	Alpha-nitrate is similar
1559000	1561000	in the same group.
1561000	1563000	For Alpha-nitrate,
1563000	1565000	the Alpha-nitrate difference
1565000	1567000	is relatively large
1567000	1569000	in the same group.
1571000	1573000	The pigmentation
1573000	1575000	that I just mentioned
1575000	1577000	is the body color change
1577000	1579000	of the insects along the height.
1579000	1581000	This shows
1581000	1583000	that the body color
1583000	1585000	is a beta-nitrate
1585000	1587000	and the alpha-nitrate
1587000	1589000	can help the insects
1589000	1591000	live on higher altitudes.
1591000	1593000	What is Alpha-nitrate?
1593000	1595000	It is related to food resources.
1595000	1597000	How do we study
1597000	1599000	food resources in soil animals?
1599000	1601000	What do they eat?
1601000	1603000	In the early days,
1603000	1605000	they simply put an insect
1605000	1607000	under a microscope
1607000	1609000	to see what contents
1609000	1611000	are in its intestine.
1611000	1613000	This technology is very good
1613000	1615000	in the study of
1615000	1617000	soil particles.
1617000	1619000	In the early days,
1619000	1621000	after 50 years,
1621000	1623000	what new methods do we have?
1623000	1625000	In the lower left corner,
1625000	1627000	you can see a
1627000	1629000	Trophy Image Parameter.
1629000	1631000	This is another study.
1631000	1633000	This is the practicality of
1633000	1635000	making insects.
1635000	1637000	We have chosen four
1637000	1639000	more common methods
1639000	1641000	to study different
1641000	1643000	insects by
1643000	1645000	using different methods.
1645000	1647000	The first method
1647000	1649000	is the method of stable isotopes.
1649000	1651000	This method can help us
1651000	1653000	know what is the feed
1653000	1655000	of a species in the soil food network.
1655000	1657000	Is it a feeder or
1657000	1659000	a first class separator or a feeder?
1659000	1661000	This is known by
1661000	1663000	stable isotopes of
1663000	1665000	alpha-nitrate.
1665000	1667000	We can also know
1667000	1669000	what is the source of
1669000	1671000	the feed of
1671000	1673000	a species in the soil.
1673000	1675000	Is it directly
1675000	1677000	eaten by plants
1677000	1679000	or those that have been
1679000	1681000	sterilized by bacteria?
1681000	1683000	This is a long-term
1683000	1685000	accumulation process.
1685000	1687000	It takes a long time
1687000	1689000	to see the change
1689000	1691000	in stable isotopes.
1691000	1693000	Compared with this,
1693000	1695000	neutral epiphytase,
1695000	1697000	neutral fatty acid,
1697000	1699000	can help us know
1699000	1701000	what is the feed of
1701000	1703000	a species in the soil.
1703000	1705000	For example,
1705000	1707000	this metabolism is
1707000	1709000	shorter than that of
1709000	1711000	the same species.
1711000	1713000	So we can know
1713000	1715000	what is the feed of
1715000	1717000	a species in the soil
1717000	1719000	for several weeks
1719000	1721000	to several months.
1721000	1723000	The second method
1723000	1725000	is digestive enzyme.
1725000	1727000	These two methods
1727000	1729000	have been used for a long time,
1729000	1731000	but they are still very useful.
1731000	1733000	Digestive enzymes,
1733000	1735000	such as fiber,
1735000	1737000	and cytosine,
1737000	1739000	can help us know
1739000	1741000	what is the feed of
1741000	1743000	a species in the soil.
1743000	1745000	Is it fiber or bacteria?
1745000	1747000	Bacteria have cytosine.
1747000	1749000	Finally,
1749000	1751000	we need to decrypt
1751000	1753000	an animal to see
1753000	1755000	what is the feed of
1755000	1757000	a species in the soil.
1757000	1759000	We found that
1759000	1761000	these four methods
1761000	1763000	are not related to each other.
1763000	1765000	It is difficult for us
1765000	1767000	to use one method
1767000	1769000	to decrypt
1769000	1771000	the other three methods.
1771000	1773000	The analysis results
1773000	1775000	show that
1775000	1777000	the four methods are
1777000	1779000	equally important.
1779000	1781000	They reflect the
1781000	1783000	different aspects of
1783000	1785000	the whole process
1785000	1787000	from swallowing,
1787000	1789000	digesting,
1789000	1791000	absorbing,
1791000	1793000	chronicling,
1793000	1795000	to its body tissue.
1795000	1797000	So,
1797000	1799000	you can see
1799000	1801000	how complicated
1801000	1803000	this thing is.
1803000	1805000	In addition to the shape of
1805000	1807000	the shape of the
1807000	1809000	shape of the
1809000	1811000	and other
1811000	1813000	more abstract
1813000	1815000	aspects,
1815000	1817000	we also have
1817000	1819000	studied
1819000	1821000	that
1821000	1823000	many Species
1823000	1825000	are
1825000	1827000	more exemplary
1827000	1831000	than other
1831000	1833000	forms of
1833000	1835000	life.
1835000	1837000	The original
1837000	1839000	species,
1839000	1841000	there are seven
1841000	1843000	different species.
1843000	1845000	Let's see
1845000	1847000	if the gene
1847000	1849000	and the bacterium
1849000	1851000	are the same
1851000	1853000	number
1853000	1855000	or not.
1855000	1857000	We found
1857000	1859000	that the gene
1859000	1861000	and the bacterium
1861000	1863000	are the same number.
1863000	1865000	Next,
1865000	1867000	we study
1867000	1869000	the larvae.
1869000	1871000	We study
1871000	1873000	the bacteria
1873000	1875000	related to the larvae
1875000	1877000	and the same number
1877000	1879000	of the larvae.
1879000	1881000	Are they related?
1881000	1883000	I think
1883000	1885000	it's interesting
1885000	1887000	that the larvae
1887000	1889000	are not only the native species,
1889000	1891000	but also the species
1891000	1893000	living on the snow.
1893000	1895000	Let's see what the larvae
1895000	1897000	eat on the snow.
1897000	1899000	In winter,
1899000	1901000	or in summer,
1901000	1903000	there is no snow in summer,
1903000	1905000	and there is snow in winter.
1905000	1907000	Let's see
1907000	1909000	if the larvae
1909000	1911000	will eat
1911000	1913000	under the snow
1913000	1915000	or on the snow.
1915000	1917000	There are
1917000	1919000	three different larvae.
1919000	1921000	We found that
1921000	1923000	there are two species
1923000	1925000	living on the snow.
1925000	1927000	Their same number
1927000	1929000	and long life
1929000	1931000	show that their food
1931000	1933000	comes from snow,
1933000	1935000	not from soil.
1935000	1937000	Another species
1937000	1939000	grows between
1939000	1941000	snow and
1941000	1943000	fallen leaves.
1943000	1945000	Its same number
1945000	1947000	and bacteria
1947000	1949000	I like this research
1949000	1951000	because it uses
1951000	1953000	two different methods
1953000	1955000	to answer
1955000	1957000	an interesting question.
1957000	1959000	What do the larvae eat
1959000	1961000	on the snow?
1961000	1963000	It's not the same as
1963000	1965000	what we usually know.
1965000	1967000	So,
1967000	1969000	we used the shape
1969000	1971000	to see the similarity
1971000	1973000	of the shape
1973000	1975000	or the relationship
1975000	1977000	between the shape
1977000	1979000	and the larvae.
1979000	1981000	What is the ecological process?
1981000	1983000	Is it the filtration process
1983000	1985000	or the division process
1985000	1987000	that affects
1987000	1989000	the group formation of
1989000	1991000	the larvae?
1991000	1993000	Next,
1993000	1995000	we will talk about
1995000	1997000	the evolution
1997000	1999000	of the shape
1999000	2001000	and the formation
2001000	2003000	of the species.
2003000	2005000	This is the multidimensional shape.
2005000	2007000	When you put different species
2007000	2009000	on an evolution relationship tree,
2009000	2011000	such as the system of evolution
2011000	2013000	or the evolution tree,
2013000	2015000	what will you see?
2015000	2017000	You will see these three species,
2017000	2019000	these three round species,
2019000	2021000	like the mouse species,
2021000	2023000	come from the same evolution value.
2023000	2025000	So, here you will see
2025000	2027000	a system of evolution.
2027000	2029000	On the shape,
2029000	2031000	you will see a system of evolution.
2031000	2033000	Another situation is
2033000	2035000	that you see these three green larvae.
2035000	2037000	Although they are all green,
2037000	2039000	they come from different evolution values.
2039000	2041000	These three round larvae
2041000	2043000	come from the same evolution value.
2043000	2045000	These three green larvae
2045000	2047000	come from different evolution values.
2047000	2049000	This is the difference.
2049000	2051000	Do they come from the same evolution value?
2051000	2053000	The more similar species are,
2053000	2055000	the more similar they are
2055000	2057000	on the shape.
2057000	2059000	So,
2059000	2061000	we use the relationship
2061000	2063000	between species.
2063000	2065000	This relationship may be determined
2065000	2067000	by the DNA sequence
2067000	2069000	and compared.
2069000	2071000	We look at the difference
2071000	2073000	in the DNA sequence.
2073000	2075000	Is the difference in the relationship
2075000	2077000	related to the shape of the species?
2077000	2079000	Then we can
2079000	2081000	understand the evolution process.
2081000	2083000	What I just said is
2083000	2085000	similar species
2085000	2087000	should be said
2087000	2089000	to be similar species.
2089000	2091000	The shape of
2091000	2093000	similar species is generally similar.
2093000	2095000	This is a necessary result.
2095000	2097000	We call such a phenomenon
2097000	2099000	a system of evolution
2099000	2101000	with a system of evolution.
2101000	2103000	The nature of the
2103000	2105000	jump worm
2105000	2107000	is composed of
2107000	2109000	neutral fatty acids.
2109000	2111000	Neutral fatty acids allow us to know
2111000	2113000	whether the source of food
2113000	2115000	is mainly bacteria or plants.
2115000	2117000	Neutral fatty acids
2117000	2119000	also allow us to know
2119000	2121000	how the jump worm adapts to temperature.
2121000	2123000	We find that
2123000	2125000	most of the neutral fatty acids
2125000	2127000	related to physiological
2127000	2129000	and temperature adaptation
2129000	2131000	show a system of evolution.
2131000	2133000	However, those fatty acids
2133000	2135000	related to food resources
2135000	2137000	do not show a system of evolution.
2137000	2139000	What I just said is
2139000	2141000	the growth of
2141000	2143000	germin.
2143000	2145000	The growth of germin
2145000	2147000	is related to
2147000	2149000	the stable number of germin.
2149000	2151000	The growth of germin
2151000	2153000	is related to the source of food.
2153000	2155000	In contrast,
2155000	2157000	the relationship between
2157000	2159000	germin bacteria and the number of germin
2159000	2161000	is not so strong.
2161000	2163000	Instead, it is related to
2163000	2165000	the system of evolution of germin.
2165000	2167000	What does this show?
2167000	2169000	It shows that these bacteria
2169000	2171000	may be a symbiotic bacteria for germin.
2171000	2173000	The relationship between germin and germin
2173000	2175000	is relatively close.
2175000	2177000	Germin may be a food,
2177000	2179000	so it is the same number as germin.
2179000	2181000	The number of germin reflects
2181000	2183000	the position of germin in the food network.
2183000	2185000	Therefore, these bacteria
2185000	2187000	can be a food
2187000	2189000	and the number of germin
2189000	2191000	can reflect the food network.
2191000	2193000	So this thing can be linked together.
2193000	2195000	What else does the evolution of germin
2195000	2197000	have in common?
2197000	2199000	We asked the question
2199000	2201000	how do these species come from?
2201000	2203000	You can put these species
2203000	2205000	together as a database.
2205000	2207000	These species in the group
2207000	2209000	are actually a part
2209000	2211000	of a large database.
2211000	2213000	A subset.
2213000	2215000	These species
2215000	2217000	have a database first,
2217000	2219000	and then they are selected
2219000	2221000	or divided into different groups.
2221000	2223000	What is the evolution process?
2223000	2225000	We asked
2225000	2227000	how this database was formed.
2227000	2229000	On a historical context,
2229000	2231000	from ancient to modern,
2231000	2233000	how do these shapes change?
2233000	2235000	How are these species formed?
2235000	2237000	There are two hypotheses.
2237000	2239000	You can imagine
2239000	2241000	that I just introduced
2241000	2243000	a vertical natural belt
2243000	2245000	at Changbai Mountain in the northeast.
2245000	2247000	The height of the peak.
2247000	2249000	Do these jump worms
2249000	2251000	evolve at high altitude first?
2251000	2253000	Or do they evolve separately
2253000	2255000	and then expand?
2255000	2257000	What you see now
2257000	2259000	are three arrows in the middle.
2259000	2261000	The three arrows point to the group.
2261000	2263000	Among the groups,
2263000	2265000	these three species
2265000	2267000	all come from the same evolution.
2267000	2269000	So it is possible that
2269000	2271000	there is a group first,
2271000	2273000	this is the base,
2273000	2275000	and then the process of germination
2275000	2277000	occurs in it.
2277000	2279000	So this germination speciation
2279000	2281000	is a relatively recent process.
2281000	2283000	That is to say,
2283000	2285000	it is possible that
2285000	2287000	there are three species
2287000	2289000	and then the species changes.
2289000	2291000	Compared to this,
2291000	2293000	you can see that
2293000	2295000	it is the same as this green frame.
2295000	2297000	This frame is a specific evolution.
2297000	2299000	But the three green jump worms
2299000	2301000	in this frame
2301000	2303000	come from different evolution.
2303000	2305000	It is possible that
2305000	2307000	these three jump worms
2307000	2309000	are formed first
2309000	2311000	and then some ecological effects
2311000	2313000	occur in this frame.
2313000	2315000	So there are jump worms first
2315000	2317000	and then ecological effects.
2317000	2319000	So it is called oligopersistence.
2319000	2321000	The one in front is speciation,
2321000	2323000	recent speciation,
2323000	2325000	the most recent evolution.
2325000	2327000	The one behind is
2327000	2329000	a relatively old group,
2329000	2331000	a relatively old species,
2331000	2333000	they spread and gather together.
2333000	2335000	So on a high altitude or
2335000	2337000	at an altitude of a mountain range,
2337000	2339000	is the jump worm first
2339000	2341000	or is it formed
2341000	2343000	at different altitudes?
2347000	2349000	These are two studies
2349000	2351000	in my previous research
2351000	2353000	that are more representative
2353000	2355000	of the formation of jump worms
2355000	2357000	and the evolution of jump worms.
2357000	2359000	The question is
2359000	2361000	how these jump worms are formed.
2361000	2363000	This study is a wide-spread
2363000	2365000	jump worm
2365000	2367000	that we have investigated
2367000	2369000	and it is actually
2369000	2371000	a wide-spread jump worm.
2371000	2373000	We think it has only one form.
2373000	2375000	So we can only identify it
2375000	2377000	as this kind,
2377000	2379000	Leptosuchus longinus.
2379000	2381000	But we use DNA
2381000	2383000	to compare its sequence.
2383000	2385000	We found that
2385000	2387000	there are not only one type
2387000	2389000	in GÃ¶ttingen andå¨é­.
2389000	2391000	In fact, there are three different types.
2391000	2393000	We call them lineages
2393000	2395000	because we are not sure
2395000	2397000	how far the relationship between them is.
2397000	2399000	How far is it?
2399000	2401000	It is so far that they have separated
2401000	2403000	when they were in Myosin.
2403000	2405000	This is a process of millions of years.
2405000	2407000	So we think
2407000	2409000	it may not be
2409000	2411000	the same species.
2411000	2413000	We also found
2413000	2415000	an interesting phenomenon.
2415000	2417000	These three different lineages
2417000	2419000	mean that
2419000	2421000	they prefer different
2421000	2423000	genotypes.
2423000	2425000	The first lineage
2425000	2427000	prefers farmland,
2427000	2429000	the second prefers forest,
2429000	2431000	and the third prefers grassland.
2431000	2433000	It seems that environmental filtering
2433000	2435000	plays a certain role here.
2435000	2437000	Environment makes
2437000	2439000	these jump worms
2439000	2441000	have some DNA division.
2441000	2443000	But we know little about it.
2443000	2445000	We do not know
2445000	2447000	what shape can
2447000	2449000	reflect these divisions.
2449000	2451000	We only know that its form is the same,
2451000	2453000	or it is different.
2453000	2455000	French tells us
2455000	2457000	that these three lineages can only
2457000	2459000	separate two lineages.
2459000	2461000	The two lineages 2 and 3
2461000	2463000	cannot be separated at all.
2463000	2465000	What is the difference between 1 and the other two?
2465000	2467000	The only difference is
2467000	2469000	the ratio of the difference
2469000	2471000	between the two hairs on the side.
2471000	2473000	So the color, body size,
2473000	2475000	or scale distribution
2475000	2477000	are not known.
2477000	2479000	We can't find one
2479000	2481000	to explain the difference
2481000	2483000	or the reason why
2483000	2485000	they prefer different genotypes.
2485000	2487000	But we know that
2487000	2489000	genotypes have an impact on
2489000	2491000	the DNA division of jump worms.
2491000	2493000	Let's go back to the research
2493000	2495000	in Changbai Mountain, northeast China.
2495000	2497000	In this research,
2497000	2499000	we found more than 20 types of
2499000	2501000	jump worms.
2501000	2503000	We want to explore
2503000	2505000	what causes
2505000	2507000	more than 20 types of jump worms,
2507000	2509000	not only 5 or 10.
2509000	2511000	Are these jump worms
2511000	2513000	related to
2513000	2515000	the evolution of
2515000	2517000	the environment
2517000	2519000	in ancient times
2519000	2521000	or now?
2521000	2523000	According to some statistics,
2523000	2525000	we know that
2525000	2527000	these jump worms
2527000	2529000	may be related to
2529000	2531000	the pH of soil
2531000	2533000	and the type of rock.
2533000	2535000	When did Changbai Mountain
2535000	2537000	form?
2537000	2539000	Changbai Mountain is the
2539000	2541000	red star
2541000	2543000	and the dotted line.
2543000	2545000	After the dotted line,
2545000	2547000	Changbai Mountain
2547000	2549000	was formed.
2549000	2551000	But these jump worms
2551000	2553000	have already been
2553000	2555000	divided into different types
2555000	2557000	before they formed.
2557000	2559000	Obviously,
2559000	2561000	these jump worms
2561000	2563000	are related to
2563000	2565000	the evolution of
2565000	2567000	the environment
2567000	2569000	in ancient times.
2569000	2571000	Therefore,
2571000	2573000	the evolution of
2573000	2575000	3D organisms,
2575000	2577000	3D soil organisms,
2577000	2579000	and 3D jump worms
2579000	2581000	is not a major factor
2581000	2583000	in the evolution of
2583000	2585000	3D organisms.
2585000	2587000	In fact,
2587000	2589000	the evolution of
2589000	2591000	3D organisms
2591000	2593000	can explain
2593000	2595000	the existence of
2595000	2597000	3D soil organisms
2597000	2599000	in ancient times.
2603000	2605000	OK.
2605000	2607000	We still have some time.
2609000	2611000	Next time,
2611000	2613000	when you observe
2613000	2615000	these soil organisms
2615000	2617000	with some special means,
2617000	2619000	we can think about
2619000	2621000	what caused
2621000	2623000	these
2623000	2625000	colorful soil organisms
2625000	2627000	to eat different foods
2627000	2629000	and live in
2629000	2631000	different environments.
2631000	2633000	After 50 years,
2633000	2635000	it seems that we have
2635000	2637000	a new understanding of these soil organisms.
2637000	2639000	So,
2639000	2641000	this is the method
2641000	2643000	I use for my research.
2643000	2645000	In general,
2645000	2647000	when we do ecological research,
2647000	2649000	we look at the environment
2649000	2651000	in which these soil organisms
2651000	2653000	grow.
2653000	2655000	In the study of soil,
2655000	2657000	we generally measure
2657000	2659000	the amount of water in the soil,
2659000	2661000	the pH value of the soil,
2661000	2663000	and the amount of carbon in the soil.
2663000	2665000	We also do some measurements
2665000	2667000	of microorganisms,
2667000	2669000	such as the amount of microorganisms,
2669000	2671000	the speed of microorganisms' breathing,
2671000	2673000	and the composition of microorganisms.
2673000	2675000	These are environmental variables
2675000	2677000	that affect the environment
2677000	2679000	they grow in,
2679000	2681000	including their food resources,
2681000	2683000	some of their physical and chemical
2683000	2685000	non-living factors.
2685000	2687000	In this environment,
2687000	2689000	we will identify
2689000	2691000	which species they belong to.
2691000	2693000	The composition of these species,
2693000	2695000	the composition of all individuals,
2695000	2697000	is called a group.
2697000	2699000	So, we will get
2699000	2701000	a group of data
2701000	2703000	about the soil organisms themselves.
2703000	2705000	During the identification process,
2705000	2707000	we will look at the shape of their bodies.
2707000	2709000	They look different.
2709000	2711000	We can classify them into different species.
2711000	2713000	But we also have to think about
2713000	2715000	whether they have the same food resources.
2715000	2717000	So, we have to know
2717000	2719000	what kind of food they eat.
2719000	2721000	This part of the data
2721000	2723000	is called the shape of the data.
2723000	2725000	Finally, we can draw DNA
2725000	2727000	from these species.
2727000	2729000	Then, we will make a series of DNA
2729000	2731000	to make their cyanobacteria.
2731000	2733000	Based on these cyanobacteria,
2733000	2735000	we can deduce
2735000	2737000	the evolution process
2737000	2739000	or the evolution pattern
2739000	2741000	in the past.
2741000	2743000	This can tell us
2743000	2745000	the system development of these species.
2745000	2747000	It can also tell us
2747000	2749000	the formation of the species
2749000	2751000	and its shape.
2751000	2753000	So, this DNA series
2753000	2755000	can be called
2755000	2757000	the fourth type of data.
2757000	2759000	I just said
2759000	2761000	that I am a data analyst.
2761000	2763000	I specialize in data analysis.
2763000	2765000	So, most of my work
2765000	2767000	is to analyze these four types of data
2767000	2769000	to see their relationship
2769000	2771000	or the difference between them.
2773000	2775000	Based on this analysis,
2775000	2777000	we can answer
2777000	2779000	which ecological processes
2779000	2781000	are filtered,
2781000	2783000	divided,
2783000	2785000	or dispersed
2785000	2787000	to affect the biodiversity
2787000	2789000	of these species.
2789000	2791000	We can also find out
2791000	2793000	why these species exist.
2797000	2799000	Let me summarize.
2799000	2801000	Filtering and
2801000	2803000	dividing are
2803000	2805000	the two main processes
2805000	2807000	in Markvillain's
2807000	2809000	selection process
2809000	2811000	and the ecological process.
2811000	2813000	So far,
2813000	2815000	these two processes,
2815000	2817000	especially the filtering process,
2817000	2819000	show the shape of
2819000	2821000	the body color.
2821000	2823000	If we want to know
2823000	2825000	the process of diversification,
2825000	2827000	we may need to use
2827000	2829000	some shapes related to food resources.
2829000	2831000	This must be achieved
2831000	2833000	by using stable isotopes,
2833000	2835000	neutral fatty acids,
2835000	2837000	enzymes, and long-distance microorganisms.
2839000	2841000	These four different ways
2841000	2843000	to study
2843000	2845000	the food resources
2845000	2847000	can help us
2847000	2849000	better understand
2849000	2851000	their food sources
2851000	2853000	and food faces.
2853000	2855000	This includes
2855000	2857000	swallowing, digesting,
2857000	2859000	absorbing, and digesting.
2859000	2861000	The whole process
2861000	2863000	of
2863000	2865000	getting nutrients.
2865000	2867000	In addition,
2867000	2869000	regarding the evolution process,
2869000	2871000	we found that most of the shape
2871000	2873000	is systemically developed.
2873000	2875000	That is to say,
2875000	2877000	the more similar species
2877000	2879000	are more similar
2879000	2881000	in shape.
2881000	2883000	However,
2883000	2885000	their food sources
2885000	2887000	are different.
2887000	2889000	What did I just say?
2889000	2891000	The more similar species
2891000	2893000	are more similar
2893000	2895000	in shape.
2895000	2897000	But the food they eat
2897000	2899000	may be different.
2899000	2901000	The more similar species
2901000	2903000	are more similar
2903000	2905000	in shape.
2905000	2907000	In the 3D system,
2907000	2909000	we know that
2909000	2911000	3D soil organisms
2911000	2913000	do not evolve
2913000	2915000	from high altitudes.
2915000	2917000	Instead,
2917000	2919000	the current evidence shows
2919000	2921000	that they come from
2921000	2923000	several older species.
2923000	2925000	Then,
2925000	2927000	through some ecological processes,
2927000	2929000	or environmental filtering,
2929000	2931000	they can gather together.
2933000	2935000	Next time,
2935000	2937000	when you walk into a forest,
2937000	2939000	you might as well
2939000	2941000	take a look at the soil
2941000	2943000	and see if there are any animals.
2945000	2947000	Try to find
2947000	2949000	these cute little animals.
2951000	2953000	That's my report.
2953000	2955000	Thank you very much
2955000	2957000	for giving me this opportunity
2957000	2959000	to talk about my research.
2959000	2961000	I also want to thank
2961000	2963000	everyone who has supported me
2963000	2965000	in the past,
2965000	2967000	including my teachers,
2967000	2969000	colleagues, friends,
2969000	2971000	and assistants in the lab.
2971000	2973000	That's all for my report.
2973000	2975000	I'll stop sharing now.
2975000	2977000	I didn't expect
2977000	2979000	that there are
2979000	2981000	16 people in the audience
2981000	2983000	who don't know me.
2985000	2987000	Thank you.
2987000	2989000	Do you have
2989000	2991000	any questions?
2995000	2997000	If you don't want
2997000	2999000	to turn on the microphone,
2999000	3001000	you can type your questions
3001000	3003000	in the chat.
3003000	3005000	I'll help you ask.
3007000	3009000	No one has
3009000	3011000	any questions,
3011000	3013000	so I'll ask first.
3013000	3015000	Ding Wenxiang,
3015000	3017000	you mentioned that
3017000	3019000	the amount of carbon dioxide
3019000	3021000	is related to the altitude
3021000	3023000	and that the altitude
3023000	3025000	is related to the body color.
3025000	3027000	Are you implying
3027000	3029000	that the body color
3029000	3031000	and the amount of carbon dioxide
3031000	3033000	are related?
3033000	3035000	What you showed
3035000	3037000	on the chart
3037000	3039000	is that the amount of carbon dioxide
3039000	3041000	is related to the body color
3041000	3043000	and that the body color
3043000	3045000	and the amount of carbon dioxide
3045000	3047000	are related.
3047000	3049000	Logically,
3049000	3051000	we can understand that
3051000	3053000	the body color
3053000	3055000	and the amount of carbon dioxide
3055000	3057000	are related.
3057000	3059000	But the data
3059000	3061000	show that
3061000	3063000	the body color
3063000	3065000	and the amount of carbon dioxide
3065000	3067000	are not related.
3067000	3069000	I can't find
3069000	3071000	the same altitude
3071000	3073000	with different body color
3073000	3075000	and see the difference
3075000	3077000	in the amount of carbon dioxide.
3077000	3079000	Do you have similar data?
3079000	3081000	In theory,
3081000	3083000	the number of
3083000	3085000	insects
3085000	3087000	in the same altitude
3087000	3089000	should be quite common.
3089000	3091000	So in theory,
3091000	3093000	you should be able to find
3093000	3095000	the same altitude
3095000	3097000	with different amount of carbon dioxide
3097000	3099000	But this is
3099000	3101000	a bit strange.
3101000	3103000	Why is the amount of carbon dioxide
3103000	3105000	related to the body color?
3105000	3107000	This is an interesting point.
3107000	3109000	You just said
3109000	3111000	that we can find
3111000	3113000	different points
3113000	3115000	on the same altitude
3115000	3117000	and see if the amount of carbon dioxide
3117000	3119000	will affect the body color.
3119000	3121000	I can say that
3121000	3123000	it should not affect the body color.
3123000	3125000	Of course,
3125000	3127000	from a mechanical point of view,
3127000	3129000	it is difficult to find
3129000	3131000	a mechanism
3131000	3133000	to explain
3133000	3135000	why the amount of carbon dioxide
3135000	3137000	will affect the body color.
3137000	3139000	As I said,
3139000	3141000	the UV ray
3141000	3143000	may be harmful to the animal.
3143000	3145000	So it must have a deeper body color
3145000	3147000	to resist or protect it
3147000	3149000	from such strong UV rays.
3149000	3151000	It may be easier to say this.
3151000	3153000	But you remind me of a point.
3153000	3155000	In fact, when we were doing the research,
3155000	3157000	we measured
3157000	3159000	three points on this altitude.
3159000	3161000	No,
3161000	3163000	we measured five points.
3163000	3165000	These five points
3165000	3167000	were finally analyzed
3167000	3169000	as a random factor.
3169000	3171000	So we don't really care
3171000	3173000	about the difference
3173000	3175000	between the five points
3175000	3177000	on the same altitude.
3177000	3179000	Our question is
3179000	3181000	the difference between different altitudes.
3181000	3183000	Whether it is the difference
3183000	3185000	between the altitude
3185000	3187000	and the amount of carbon dioxide
3187000	3189000	in the soil,
3189000	3191000	we want to find
3191000	3193000	the one that can best explain
3193000	3195000	the body color distribution
3195000	3197000	of this group
3197000	3199000	in statistics.
3199000	3201000	In statistics,
3201000	3203000	but you will find
3203000	3205000	that it is more difficult
3205000	3207000	to understand.
3207000	3209000	So your data
3209000	3211000	is still taken by you,
3211000	3213000	instead of doing
3213000	3215000	a meta-data analysis.
3215000	3217000	Most of what I just said
3217000	3219000	is my own actual research
3219000	3221000	and data.
3221000	3223000	The real meta-analysis
3223000	3225000	is the relationship
3225000	3227000	between the four methods
3227000	3229000	of soil erosion.
3229000	3231000	That is the meta-analysis.
3231000	3233000	We still like to go out in the wild
3233000	3235000	and actually measure the material
3235000	3237000	to see what the animals look like.
3237000	3239000	I prefer to sit in front of the computer
3239000	3241000	and analyze the data.
3241000	3243000	I need my colleagues
3243000	3245000	and friends
3245000	3247000	to provide the first-hand data.
3247000	3249000	Then we have the opportunity
3249000	3251000	to reuse their data
3251000	3253000	and ask different scientific questions.
3253000	3255000	So I really appreciate
3255000	3257000	and cherish their contribution
3257000	3259000	to soil biology.
3259000	3261000	Of course, everyone
3261000	3263000	has to find their own niche
3263000	3265000	and partition
3265000	3267000	in order to
3267000	3269000	find what they like
3269000	3271000	and share the knowledge
3271000	3273000	with their colleagues.
3273000	3275000	Some of my colleagues
3275000	3277000	are very good at
3277000	3279000	soil biology,
3279000	3281000	and they are also
3281000	3283000	very good at
3283000	3285000	identification biology.
3285000	3287000	In this respect,
3287000	3289000	we are just a
3289000	3291000	complementary role.
3291000	3293000	Do you have any questions?
3293000	3295000	I don't want to be recorded.
