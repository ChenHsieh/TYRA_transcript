160000	166000	Sorry.
166000	171000	Can you see me clearly now?
171000	172000	Yes.

188000	189000	Please turn on the microphone
189000	194000	and give a round of applause to welcome Julia.
194000	195000	Thank you.
195000	201000	Thank you, Theta, for inviting me to share my research with you.
201000	206000	Thank you, Theta, for your detailed introduction.
206000	209000	Today, I will talk about
209000	211000	the social welfare network
211000	216000	and its features in East Asia.
216000	223000	We will cover the situation before and after COVID-19 pandemic.
224000	227000	I know that many of you
227000	233000	may not know much about social welfare.
233000	236000	Let me give you a brief introduction.
236000	241000	Social welfare can be divided into three areas,
241000	245000	including social insurance, social assistance, and welfare services.
245000	251000	Social insurance is a risk factor in our lives.
251000	257000	Many countries use insurance to deal with it.
257000	260000	However, there are also many countries that do not use insurance.
260000	264000	In Taiwan, we have a social insurance system
264000	268000	for pensioners.
268000	272000	Employment insurance also includes unemployment insurance.
272000	276000	National Insurance is also a social insurance feature.
276000	281000	We need to contribute so that we can benefit in the future.
281000	284000	Another part is social assistance.
284000	287000	In some cases,
287000	290000	everyone may face risks.
290000	293000	For example, if you become very poor and unemployed,
293000	296000	and your job does not allow you to have social insurance,
296000	300000	or if you encounter some changes in your family,
300000	302000	you may need social assistance,
302000	304000	including low-income households and middle-income households.
304000	308000	In the U.S., we have food stamps,
308000	311000	which are food-related relief measures.
311000	314000	In the U.S., Section 8 of the Housing Assistance Act
314000	317000	uses housing vouchers to help people.
317000	322000	There is also public housing in Taiwan.
322000	326000	In addition, there are also measures to help families
326000	332000	who cannot afford to send their children to school.
333000	336000	In addition to social assistance,
336000	339000	there are also welfare services.
339000	342000	For example,
342000	345000	child abuse or elderly care services
345000	348000	may be needed.
348000	351000	Whether it's public or private,
351000	355000	welfare services are provided by welfare agencies.
355000	359000	So the social welfare sector is mostly related to Hanguas.
359000	362000	I will focus on the social assistance sector today.
362000	365000	I will focus on the social assistance sector today.
365000	368000	In the introduction of the document,
368000	371000	we often compare the social insurance and social assistance
371000	374000	in the East Asian welfare system.
374000	377000	In the East Asian welfare system,
377000	380000	we often compare the social insurance and social assistance.
380000	383000	I will explain the terms first.
383000	386000	The research I am going to share today
386000	389000	was initiated in 2019
389000	392000	by Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo.
392000	395000	Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo was invited by the National University of Seoul
395000	398000	to give a lecture at their school.
398000	401000	to give a lecture at their school.
401000	404000	Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.
404000	407000	Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.
407000	410000	I think organizing research teams
410000	413000	is a bit like making a movie.
413000	416000	In my mind,
416000	419000	I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.
419000	422000	I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.
422000	425000	However, it takes a lot of resources
425000	428000	to gather all the party members from all over the world.
428000	431000	to gather all the party members from all over the world.

452000	455000	from the National University of Singapore.
455000	458000	We organized a research team to study six places in East Asia,
458000	461000	including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,
461000	464000	Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.
464000	467000	We organized a research team to study six places in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.
