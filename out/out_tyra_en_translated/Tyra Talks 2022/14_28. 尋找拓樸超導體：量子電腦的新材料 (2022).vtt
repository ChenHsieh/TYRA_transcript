00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome to today's Taira Talk.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Taira stands for Taiwanese Young Researcher Association.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
It's an organization for young researchers in Taiwan.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Every weekend of the year,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
we hold an event called Taira Talk.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
The format of the talk is free and diverse.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
We invite academic researchers from different fields

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
to share their research results,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
practice online speech skills,

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
or share their experiences with potential partners.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
The topic of today's talk is

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Notre Dame.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
It is a talk about economic science.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
If you are interested,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
you are welcome to follow Tara's post

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and Tara's talk.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Today's speaker is Mr. Xu.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
He graduated from National Tsinghua University in 2009.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Later, he came to Cornell for a Ph.D.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
a Ph.D. in physics.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
In 2017,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
he obtained his doctorate.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
After graduating from Cornell,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
he came to the

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
University of Newfoundland-Myanmar

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Condensed Matter Theory Center.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
In 2020,

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
he got a Ph.D. from the University of Newfoundland-Myanmar.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
His main interest is

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
the new phenomenon of quantum many-body system.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
His main focus is

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
inter-winded symmetry,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
topology,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and many-body interaction.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Today, he is going to talk about

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
topology and quantum computing.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Today, he is going to talk about

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
topology and quantum computing.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Let's follow Tara's post

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
and welcome Mr. Xu.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hello, everyone.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Today, I am going to talk about

03:39.000 --> 03:51.000
the relationship between topology and quantum computing.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I will try my best to be scientific.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
If you have any questions,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
please feel free to ask me.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
First of all,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I am a quantum theory physicist.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Today, I am going to share

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
how a quantum theory physicist

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
can contribute to the topic.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
As you can see,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I am looking for

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
postdocs and Ph.D. students.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
If you find this talk interesting,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
please feel free to contact me.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Today, the audience comes from different backgrounds.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I would like to explain

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
what quantum theory is.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Quantum theory is

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
condensed matter theoretical physics.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
We are studying

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
quantum theory.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I am not an experimenter.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The tools we use are

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
computers and pens.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
What is quantum theory?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Quantum theory is an equation

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
that describes the materials

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
in nature,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
and the special materials

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
in the lab.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
All of these materials are

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
solid or liquid.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
This is condensed matter.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
As you can see,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
this is a diagram.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
For example,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
this is a two-dimensional material.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
It is like a piece of paper.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
These black balls

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
are all atoms.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
This is a fairly microscopic scale.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
If you look at the size of the atom,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
you can see that

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
there are different scales

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
in a two-dimensional material.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
The scale is hexagonal.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
This is just a diagram.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
What we are studying

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
is different materials

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
with different scales.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You can imagine that

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
there are atoms next to each atom.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
According to quantum mechanics,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
there are different activities

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
around the atom.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
What we are studying is

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
those atoms

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
in a background like this,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
with different scales

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
in a two-dimensional material.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
What interesting things

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
will happen?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
This is the topic

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
for those who are interested

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
in quantum physics.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I also want to talk about

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
what we often hear.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It is very important

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
for people who do

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
experimental physics,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
especially in quantum mechanics.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What is the relationship

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
between theory and

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
experimental physics?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Most important discoveries

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
in history

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
in the past 100 years

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
were made by experiments.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
In some experiments,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
people found

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
amazing things

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
in the material.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Let me give you

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
an example.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
For example,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
in the past 100 years,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
you can see that

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
since 2003,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
the discovery of superconductors,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
superfluid,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
superfluid in etheric ocean,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
even the famous high-temperature superconductors,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and some important

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
superconductors were discovered.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
These were discovered

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
by experiments.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
These are

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
four Nobel Prizes.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
They were discovered

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
by experiments

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
or plans

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
to discover

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
special phenomena

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
in the material.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Then,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
theoretical physicists

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
tried to

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
understand

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
the phenomena

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
in the experiment.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
However,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
this is not always the case.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Sometimes,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
it is the theory

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
that makes the prediction first.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Then,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
experimentalists

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
tried to see

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
the predicted phenomena

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
in the real system.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Sometimes,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
these big discoveries

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
can also be discovered.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
However,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
this is not always the case.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The reason is that

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
for superconductors,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
this is today's topic.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Of course,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I will explain what superconductors are.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
For superconductors,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
it is difficult

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
to make such predictions.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Then,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
what I want to do

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
is to

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
predict

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
how to find

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
special superconductors

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
in theory,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
predict

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
how to make

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
special superconductors

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
in theory,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and how to design

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
special superconductors

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
in theory.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
This is

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
the focus of my research.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Then,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
now,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I will

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
use a more

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
physical way

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
to describe

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
the problems

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
that physicists

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
are studying.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Here is the problem.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
You may have seen

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
the periodic table in high school.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
There are so many elements

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
in the periodic table.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
There are more materials.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Because not only these elements,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
you can choose

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
several elements

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and combine them

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
into different compounds.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
you can find

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
tens of thousands

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
of materials

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
in nature

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
or in the lab.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But it sounds

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
like it is

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
a very difficult problem

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
to study the nature of materials.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Why? Let me give you an example.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
For example,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
let's look at this one.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Cu is copper.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Copper is a very common

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
material, right?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
But today,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I will make some changes

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
to the copper.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I can remove

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
some electrons,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
neutrons,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and neutrons from the

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
nucleus.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Then, I can jump

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
to the next one,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Ni.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
It is just next to it.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But their properties

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
are very different.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Copper has no magnetic properties.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
But we know that

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Ni is also

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
magnetic.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So, their properties

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
are very different.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Now,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
let's focus on

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
one element.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Let's focus on C.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
C means carbon.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
you can use carbon

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
to form

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
this complex 3D structure.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Then, you get diamonds.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
If you put

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
these carbon atoms

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
into

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
this 2D structure,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and there are many layers,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
then it will be

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
copper.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It is also carbon,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
but it is totally different from diamonds.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
If I only take one layer,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
then it will be

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
copper.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It is totally different.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Then,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
the blue circles are

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
carbon.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Although they are all

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
made of carbon,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
their properties are very different.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
For example,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
diamonds

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
are very good

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
solvents,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
but

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
copper and

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
silver are very good solvents.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Although

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
these two are solvents,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
if you really

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
pay attention to the numbers,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
their

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
solubility is still very different.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Although you don't have to

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
care about the unit,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
but if you just look at the numbers,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
you will know that they are very different.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
10 to the power of 8 and 10 to the power of 6

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
are 100 times different.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Even if

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
the elements

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
don't seem to be much different,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
or even the same element,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
but you build it

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
into different structures,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
their properties can be

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
100 to the power of 8.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It sounds like

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
it's a big deal

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
for people who study materials.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Because there are so many different materials

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
that can be made in nature

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
or in a laboratory.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Do we have to

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
study them one by one?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It takes a lot of time,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
manpower, and material resources.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It feels like

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
it's not a solution.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
In fact,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
this is not how research is done.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
The way we approach

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
this problem is not

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
one case by one case.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
This is what we do.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Logically,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
we classify

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
so many different materials

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
according to their

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
relative properties.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
For example,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I classify

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
red materials

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
according to their

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
relative properties.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Then we ask

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
why the properties of these materials

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
are the same.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
For example,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
this cartoon example

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
is based on

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
the theory of

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
quantum physics.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
We want to know

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
why the properties

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
are the same.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
It means that

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
we don't care

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
only about the properties

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
of the materials.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We want to ask

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
what happened

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
to make

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
all the materials

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
red.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
We care about

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
the size of the materials.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Each ball

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
represents the size of the materials.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
For example,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
all the balls are red

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
because the materials are red.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
In fact, the materials are not red,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
but they all wear red hats.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
We want to know

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
the size of the materials.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
This is a cartoon example.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
In fact,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
it's not true.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
In such a small scale,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
the important thing is

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
that quantum mechanics

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
becomes very important.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Quantum mechanics

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
already exists in everyday life,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
but because the general scale

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
is too large,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
we can't see the effect of quantum mechanics.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
However, quantum mechanics

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
becomes very important

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
in the microscopic scale of electronics.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
So what we are going to study

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
is how quantum mechanics

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
affects the behavior

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
of these electronics

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
to make the materials

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
have certain properties,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
such as their color, etc.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Let's use a more academic way

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
to describe this problem.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It's like this.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
What we are studying

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
is that there are many, many electrons

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
that spread

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
in different materials.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
These materials

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
have different lattices,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
just like the hexagonal lattice

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I just showed you.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
They also have different shapes.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But when I say many,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I mean

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
a lot,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
like 10 to the power of 23.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That's a lot.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
To study this problem,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I can't

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
ask a computer

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
to simulate it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because there are too many of them.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
A traditional computer

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
like this

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
can't run

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
a brute force simulation.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
A computer can't simulate

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
so many examples at once.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
What's more,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
there's another point

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
that makes it more complicated.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
These electrons

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
don't move separately.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
They interact with each other.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So this makes

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
the problem more complicated.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Another point

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
is that

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
different lattices

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
have different effects.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Different lattices

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
have different shapes.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
For example,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
this is a hexagonal lattice.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This point and that point

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
have two different colors,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
meaning two different atoms.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I can also show you

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
a triangular lattice.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Look at the complex structure.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
These lattices

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
can have different atoms.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So these are

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
different lattices.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Their symmetry is different.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So I need to

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
not only study

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
the problem of electrons,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
but also look at the environment

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
of these lattices,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
the environment of electrons.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
In fact,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
these lattices have many symmetries.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
There are 230 different symmetries

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
in nature.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
it's not just

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
the materials in nature.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
There are various systems

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
that can be created

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
artificially in the laboratory.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
For example,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
cold atoms

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
can be cooled

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
to a very low temperature

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
to control

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
how they interact with each other.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So even systems like this

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
can be

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
done very well

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
in the lab.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So it feels like

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
there are many

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
difficulties.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
There are many

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
complicated things

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
in it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So if we want to

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
deal with such problems,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
we have to find a way

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
to simplify such problems.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
This is a very difficult thing,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
because the materials

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
are very complicated.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So you have to understand

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
the theory behind it,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
and then use simple but understandable

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
methods to understand

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
what happened

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
at the electron level

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
in the microscope.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
This is a very challenging thing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
But at the same time,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
everyone is willing to do this.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
The reason is that

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
this is a very rewarding thing.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
To understand the nature

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and the nature of materials

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
is a very interesting thing.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
But at the same time,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
to understand the theory

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
behind these materials

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
can have

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
various applications.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
For example,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
about 40 years ago,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
or 60 years ago,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
physicists and

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
materialists

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
spent a lot of

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
time and effort

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
to understand

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
how a semiconductor works.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
So now we have

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
all kinds of convenient mobile phones.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
We are entering the age of computers.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Another example is

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
superconductors.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
The theory of superconductors

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
has been

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
widely understood

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
for a long time.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Now,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
people have started to

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
make large magnets.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
This is

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
the LHC ring

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
that has been used

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
in the Swiss particle accelerator.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
These are

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
some examples.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
If you are able to

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
understand the material

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
in detail,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
there will be

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
some practical applications.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
So,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
how should we

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
simplify such a complicated problem?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
To put it simply,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
due to quantum mechanics,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
electrons will move

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
together

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
at extremely low temperature,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
which is

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
close to absolute zero.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That is,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
although there are

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
so many electrons in

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
10²³,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
they will not move

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and disturb each other.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
They tend to do

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
the same thing.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
even if the material is

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
of a very different kind,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
or even the structure

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
of the atom

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
is different,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and the sample is made

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
in a different lab,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
it does not matter.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Due to quantum mechanics,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
there will only be

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
one mode of action,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
but not infinite.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Only a few kinds

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
are likely to occur,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and all electrons will move together.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
to study the theory of material,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
what we need to do

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
is to study

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
the collective mode of action

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
of electrons at low temperature.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Then,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
we need to find a way

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
to classify these modes

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
into different kinds.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
As long as we can do this,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
we can do it.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
So, we don't need to study

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
each material individually,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and each material is different.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
These so-called

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
universal collective behavior

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
actually have another name,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
which is phases,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
or you may have heard of

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
images,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
images of materials.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Then,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
if we want to

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
classify these

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
different images

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
in quantum materials,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
we need to have some rules

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
so that we can say

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
that the collective behavior

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
of these electrons

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
is one kind,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and the collective behavior

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
of those electrons

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
is another kind.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
more than 100 years ago,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
there was a great physicist

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
named Randall.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Randall proposed that

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
we should break

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
the collective behavior

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
of these electrons

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
by symmetry.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
For example,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
the most familiar example

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
is the magnet.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The reason why

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
the magnetic field

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and the magnetic field

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
are similar is that

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
if you zoom in

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
and see what the electrons

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
are doing,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
each electron has

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
a magnetic field.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
This magnetic field

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
is like a magnet.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
You can imagine

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
these spins

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
as if there is

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
a small arrow

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
in the electron,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and these arrows

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
point from the south

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
to the north.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
the magnet has this kind

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
of magnetic field.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
The symmetry

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
of the magnet

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
is that

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
these small arrows

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
cannot rotate at will.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
If it is not in a magnet,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
these small arrows

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
can rotate at will

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
in the electron.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It does not have to

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
point in the same direction,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
but because it is

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
in a magnet,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
each small arrow

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
has to point in the same direction.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
This is symmetry destruction.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Another example

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
is this picture.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
What is this?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
This is a

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
experimental picture.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
They used

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
a very small

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
carbon needle

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
to scan the surface

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
of the material.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
This is the picture they obtained.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I don't know if you can see it,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
but there are

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
little white things here.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Those little white things are atoms.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
But you can also see

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
a relatively large amount

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
of lines.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
This tells us

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
that if the material

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
is clean enough,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
the size of the atom

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
is much smaller than the lines.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But we can see

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
a wave-shaped

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
line.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
This is a

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
quantum state.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
This quantum state

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
destroys

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
the symmetry

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
of the material.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
This is

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
a translational symmetry.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Those are

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
two different examples.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Now,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
let's talk about superconductivity.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Superconductivity is

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
also an example.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Superconductivity is

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
an interesting quantum state.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
As we all know,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
superconductivity

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
is a perfect

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
conductor.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Its resistance R is zero.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
If you can

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
make a wire

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
with superconductivity,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
the wire will not heat up

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
because there will be no damage.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You can pass the wire

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
from one end to the other

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
without any damage.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
This is superconductivity.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
There is another

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
characteristic of superconductivity.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It does not like magnetic field.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
This is called Meissner effect.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Superconductivity

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
is a perfect conductor

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
and it rejects.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
These characteristics

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
can only occur at a very low temperature.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Otherwise, most of the

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
wires are made with superconductivity.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Because the temperature

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
must be low enough.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
This is

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
why a very popular

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
research topic

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
is to find out

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
if there is superconductivity at room temperature.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Let me

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
show you

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
what I mean

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
when I say superconductivity is zero.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Let's say this material

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
is a superconductor.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You add a current

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
to it

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
to measure

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
its voltage difference.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Then you can get superconductivity.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
If it is

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
a superconductor,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
when you lower the temperature,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
it will

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
suddenly become zero

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
at room temperature.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
However, if it is

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
a non-superconducting metal,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
its voltage

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
will only

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
decrease but not reach zero.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
This is the special feature of superconductivity.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This is

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
a practical example. This is a ball.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
When the ball is at a low temperature,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
it will also become superconductive.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
we just said that

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
there are two

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
important properties of superconductivity.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
One of them is

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
that its resistance will be zero.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But what happened

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to the superconductor

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
when it became zero?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
In fact,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I just showed you this picture.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
This is a gold bar.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
The black part

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
is the atom.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
The atom is moving around the atom.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
You can imagine

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
that the two atoms are moving around

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
and interacting with each other.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
There are a lot of atoms.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
What happened in the superconductor

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
is that

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
the atom and the atom

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
decide not to

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
move separately.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They want to

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
move hand in hand

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
and group by group

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
in the gold bar.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
So

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
they will form

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
an electron-bound state.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
This kind of electron-bound state

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
is called Cooper pairs.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
The reason why they are willing to do this

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
instead of individual electron-bound states

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
is because

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
this is less energy for them.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
So

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
when they form

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
this pair of Cooper pairs,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
all these Cooper pairs

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
do the same thing

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
together.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
This is because of the quantum mechanics.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So these Cooper pairs

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
do not move

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
one to this side

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
and the other to that side.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
They all do the same thing.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
they do not collide with each other

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and cause damage.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
This is why there is no electron-bound state.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Because all these Cooper pairs

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
are moving in the same direction.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They do not collide

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
and cause damage.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
And

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
if we want to

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
look at them from the perspective of symmetry destruction,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
because electrons

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
can form this kind of

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
pair of electrons,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
but they can also

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
destroy these pair of electrons at any time.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
So from this perspective,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
the number of electrons is irregular.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
OK, so

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I just gave you three examples

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
to see

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
how to use symmetry destruction

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
to understand the collective behavior

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
of electrons.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
But this theory is not perfect.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
In the experiment,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
we gradually found that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
although some systems have the same symmetry,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
although they have different symmetries,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
some of their

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
observational phenomena are exactly the same.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Then there are other examples

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
that their symmetries are different,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
but

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
their symmetries are the same,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
but their material properties

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
are very different.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So this means that

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
symmetry destruction

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
is not the only

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
tool we should

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
use to understand

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
the collective behavior of electrons.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It seems that

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
we still need other new ways to distinguish them.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
In the past

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
40 years,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
actually,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
30 years,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
we have learned that

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
symmetry destruction

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is not the only

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
tool we should

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
use to understand

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
the collective behavior of electrons.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
In the past 30 years,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
physicists have learned that

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
symmetry destruction

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
is a very important concept

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
in mathematics.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
By using symmetry destruction

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
to understand materials and physics,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
we have made a lot of progress

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
in understanding materials.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
In 2016,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the Nobel Prize for Physics

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
was awarded to

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Thorpe material.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Thorpe material

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
was used to understand materials.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Here,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I would like to

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
use the simplest way

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
to explain what Thorpe is.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Because this word

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
looks quite unfamiliar.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
After all, it is a translation word.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
In English, it is called topology.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
In mathematics,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Thorpe is a very

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
large field.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
However, when we use it to understand

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
materials,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
we only use some of the concepts.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Now, I will give you

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
the simplest example

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
that I hope you can understand.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
let's not look at materials.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Let's go back to what Thorpe is

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in mathematics.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
First,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
let's get out of the reality.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Let's use a more abstract way

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
to think about it.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Let's say I have two spaces.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
The blue space is my base space.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
The red space is my target space.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Let's say

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
the blue space

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
is a circular path.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Let's say

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
the blue space

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
is a circular path.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
The other space

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
is a point.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It is a point

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
that can rotate on a plane.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
The point

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
can rotate

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
from 0 to 360 degrees.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Let's say

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I define these two spaces.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I can ask

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
what is the

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
one-to-one relationship

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
between these two spaces.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
What does it mean?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Let's say

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
each point

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
has a point.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
What is the

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
pattern of this point?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I am asking

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
what is the angle

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
of each point.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
What is the direction

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
of each point?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
What is the possibility?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Let's look at

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
the first example.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Let's say

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I put a arrow

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
on each point.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
In this example,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
when I turn around

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and ask how the arrow rotates,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
you can see

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
each arrow rotates a little bit,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
but not much.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
This situation

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
is totally different

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
from this situation.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
In this situation,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
when you walk around

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
the circle,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
the arrow rotates 360 degrees,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
which means

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
the arrow rotates a full circle.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
In this example,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
when you walk around

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
the circle,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the arrow rotates

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
two times.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Theoretically,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
if you continue

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
to walk around

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
the blue circle,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
you can walk around

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the whole circle

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and not only this.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
You can walk around

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the whole circle

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and not only this.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
In this example,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
you can use

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
a winding number

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
to describe

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
the rotation of

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the red arrow.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
The winding number

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
is the number

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
of the circle

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
of the circle.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The winding number

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
is the number

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
of the circle

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
of the circle.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Or you can imagine

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
the winding number

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
as a label

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
to mark

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
the different situations.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Or you can imagine

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the winding number

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
as a label

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
to mark

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
the different situations.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Or you can imagine

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
the winding number

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
as a label

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
to mark

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
the different situations.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Now you can ask

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
how to apply

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
the mathematical definition

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
on the materials

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and how to find

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
the rotation of

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
the arrow

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
The answer is

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
usually the blue space

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
is the kinetic space of the arrow

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
so it is related to

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
the kinetic space of the arrow.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
The red space

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
is the

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
position of the electric wave function.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
For those who don't know

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
what is the electric wave function

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
you can imagine

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
the position of the electric wave function

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
as

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
each arrow

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
points to a small bell

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and the bell

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
has a red arrow

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
with only 10 arrows.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
You can imagine

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
the arrow

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
points to

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
the different directions

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
on the bell

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
so you can imagine

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
the bell

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
as the bell.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It is similar to the example

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I showed you

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
The arrow

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
points to the

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
different directions

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
on the bell

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and the bell

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
has a red arrow

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
with only 10 arrows.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I have just

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
explained

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
the meaning of

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
the elliptic

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and how to define

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
the elliptic

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
in the materials.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Is it because

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
the elliptic has a special nature?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Even though

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
the elliptic

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
has a special nature,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
if the

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
experiment

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
doesn't show

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
the elliptic,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
it is just a

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
definition of the elliptic.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
The answer is

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
the elliptic

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
has a special nature

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
when the

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
elliptic

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
points to the

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
different directions

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
on the bell.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
What does it mean?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Let me give you

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
a famous example.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It is called

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
integer quantum Hall effect.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
What does it mean?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Let's take

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
a metal or

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
a semiconductor film

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and measure the

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
cross section

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
of the current I

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
with the

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
current V

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and the

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
current I.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
If you take

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the ratio of

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
V and I,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
you can get

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
the Hall resistance

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
rho h.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
If the experiment

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
is done at room temperature,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
many materials

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
and physics

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
do the experiment

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
at the university.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
You can ask

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
how the Hall resistance

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
changes with the

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
size of the magnetic field.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I can tell you

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
it is a linear change.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The bigger the magnetic field,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the bigger the Hall resistance.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
However,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
if you do the experiment

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
at low temperature,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
you will find

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
the result is very different.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
As the magnetic field

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
gets bigger,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
you can see

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
the curve is like a step.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
What's more,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
we call it

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
quantized plateaus.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
It is one step at a time.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
What's more,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
if you look at

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the value

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
of Hall resistance,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
you will find

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
it is

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
one over

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
a whole number.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This is the amazing part.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
This part,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
h over e squared,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
is a universal constant.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It is just a value.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You can think of it as a fixed number,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
26kΩ.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
However,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
this part, one over c,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
tells you c is a whole number.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
In other words,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
if you read its value,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
it is 26 divided by 2,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
which is 13.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Similarly,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
26 divided by 3, 26 divided by 4, etc.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Why is it amazing?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The amazing result

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
is because

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
people found

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
different experiments

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
from different people

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
to get the same result.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
However,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
the result is exactly the same.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The value is

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
exactly

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
negative 9 times of 10.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
So,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
it is very strange.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
These values

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
become

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
the common unit

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
of quantum mechanics

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
in the end.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
So,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
it is very amazing.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
In 1982,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
a quantum theorist

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
found that

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
the reason behind this result

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
is that

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
the electron

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
goes around

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
2, 3, 4, etc.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
So,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
the result is

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
exactly the same.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
However,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I don't have time

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
to explain

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
why it is so.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So, this is the first

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
characteristic of top material,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
which is that

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the conductor

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
is the value of

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
the whole number.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
The second

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
interesting characteristic is that

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
if

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
this square

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
is a two-dimensional

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
top material,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
we can find that

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
there is an electron

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
going along the same direction

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
on the edge of the sample.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
So,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
these electrons

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
just sit on the edge of the sample.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
There is no electron inside.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Moreover,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
they go along the same direction.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
So,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
this characteristic

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
can be seen

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
in almost all

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
top materials.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
So, this is the second interesting characteristic.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
So,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
after the whole number

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
quantum Hall effect,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
we found that

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
it is not just a wave model.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
In fact, many metals,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
semiconductors, or solvents

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
can have top characteristics,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
which means that

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
they all have the transmission characteristics of the whole number,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and they all have electron flow on the edge.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Now, I want to ask a question.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
How can I define a top superconductor?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That is to say,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
when electrons form a qubit like this

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
at low temperature,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
in the case of

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
a two-dimensional qubit,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
can I also have a top characteristic?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
The answer is of course yes.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
let me give you a definition first.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That is to say,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
how do I define a top superconductor

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
according to the definition

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
we just explained?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
All the important information

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
related to the superconductor

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
is hidden

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
in the

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
kinetic energy of an electron itself,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and when it

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
forms

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
a qubit,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
what is its wave function?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
So, simply put,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
if you want to describe a superconductor,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
any superconductor,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
basically what you care about is

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
what is its kinetic energy before it forms a qubit,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and what is its wave function

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
after it forms a qubit.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
As long as you know these two things,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
you can basically understand

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
most of the

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
properties of a superconductor.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
using those two things,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
the kinetic energy of a single electron

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and the wave function of a qubit,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
these two quantities,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
C and Δ,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I can construct

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
a three-dimensional superconductor.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I'm just showing it off,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
but you don't really need to understand it.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
In short, it's a superconductor

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
constructed by those two quantities.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
From this superconductor,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I can play the game I just played,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
construct and define

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
two different spaces.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
The first space is still

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
the kinetic energy of an electron,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
but the second space

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
is not just a qubit,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
but a three-dimensional superconductor

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
because it's a three-dimensional superconductor.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
So you can imagine

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
it's just a qubit,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and it can rotate

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
in a three-dimensional space.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I can ask

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
if there is

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
a circle

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
between these two spaces.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
You can imagine

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
this

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
three-dimensional

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
superconductor space

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
is a qubit,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and it can rotate

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
in a three-dimensional space.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
That's pretty much it.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
There is a very famous example,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
which is

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
a P-wave superconductor.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
If you have

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
heard of

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
related physics,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
or know more about

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
related physics,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
this is a famous example.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
What is the thing

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
that rotates here?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It's the wave function of

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
the cooper pair.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You can see it's rotating around

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
on its qubit.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Another important property is

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
that in this special

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
superconductor,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
the magnetic field

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
of the electron

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
must be the same

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
as the magnetic field

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
of the qubit.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It's a Pauli Exclusion Principle.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Statistics

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
must be the same.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
OK.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Next, let's ask

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
what properties does this superconductor have?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Here comes the important part.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Remember

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
the second type of

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
superconductor properties I mentioned?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Is there electromagnetic flow

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
on the boundary of the sample?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
In the

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
semiconductor,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
we can say

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
there is electromagnetic flow

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
on the boundary of the sample.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
But in the superconductor,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you can still find something

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
on the boundary of the sample.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But the special example

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
is not an ordinary electron.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
It's a special example

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
called Majorana.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
So it is

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
only on the boundary of the sample.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
But how special is it?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
The special thing is

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
it is the same

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
as its antiparticle.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
It is a special example

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
of antiparticle.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
OK.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
These are some examples.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
For example,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
if you have a 1-dimensional superconductor,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
you can find Majorana particle

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
on the boundary of

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
the 2-dimensional superconductor.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It is 0-dimensional.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
If you have a gray 2-dimensional

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
superconductor,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you can find a 1-dimensional

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Majorana mole

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
on the boundary.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
If you have a 3-dimensional superconductor,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
you can find a 2-dimensional

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Majorana mole

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
on the surface of

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
the 3-dimensional superconductor.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
But what I want to emphasize today

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
is that in this 2-dimensional example,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
there is an additional place

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
where you can find Majorana mole.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
That is to say,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
if the magnetic field

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
penetrates the superconductor,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
you will form a lot of curvatures.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
That is to say,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
In the middle of these curvatures,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
you can also find

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
a 0-dimensional Majorana mole.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
OK.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Then,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
when this kind of

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
2-dimensional superconductor

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
is 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
people are particularly

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
interested in it.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Because it has quantum computing

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
as a possible application.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
If we want to talk about quantum computing,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
we have to focus on

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
this 0-dimensional Majorana mole.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So it is 0-dimensional and energy is 0.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We call it Majorana zero mole.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
There are a lot of

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
research shows that

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
it is proposed that

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
using

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
the curvature

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
generated by the magnetic field

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I just mentioned

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
to form the Majorana mole,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
to form the so-called qubit.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
The qubit is

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
the qubit in quantum computing.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So what is a qubit?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
In a traditional computer,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
in a traditional computer,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
we know that there are a lot of 0s and 1s, right?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Then the qubit

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
is the thing

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
0 and 1

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
corresponding to the quantum computer.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
But it is no longer

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
just 0 and 1.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
There are different numbers.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
But I don't have time

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
to go into that part.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So I will

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
mention

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
what are the benefits

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
of using the Turp superconverter

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
to do quantum computing.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Why do we have to use the Turp superconverter?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
The advantage of using the Turp superconverter

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
to do quantum computing is

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
quantum computing

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
has always been

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
a possible problem that everyone cares about.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
For example,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
if you put a quantum computer

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
in an environment,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
it can do

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
very powerful calculations,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
but due to environmental impact,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
it will still be affected by the environment,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
so it will lead to errors in the calculation.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And if the error rate

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is too high,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
quantum computing will not be established.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
But if you use

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
the Turp superconverter

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
as the material

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
to do quantum computing,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
this qubit,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
the smallest computing unit,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
is not

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
in the same place.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Instead,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I can take two

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
relatively distant currents

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and the Mariana Zero Mode

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
as a qubit.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
In other words,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
if I have some

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
local noise

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
in this environment,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
it will not destroy

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
the information in this qubit.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Because I can't

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
affect the two Mariana Zero Mode

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
at the same time.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I usually only affect one side,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
but not the other side.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
In this case,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
you have to affect

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
both sides at the same time

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
to affect the calculation.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
So this is why

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
everyone says that

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
using the Turp superconverter

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
is the best way

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
to do quantum computing.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
It is also a way

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
to do quantum computing

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
with higher convergence rate.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Finally,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I want to say

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
that it sounds pretty good,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
right?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
If there is a Turp superconverter,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
we can use it

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
to build a quantum computer.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Why haven't I heard about it?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
The reason is

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
what kind of material

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
is a Turp superconverter?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
The answer is

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
almost none.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
In other words,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
the existence of a Turp superconverter

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
is actually a quantum material

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
that has been predicted

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
by theory.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
But what kind of

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
actual material

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
is a Turp superconverter?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Then you can find

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the Mariana Zero Mode in it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
This is a big problem.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Although there are

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
a lot of papers

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
claiming that

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
they have seen

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
the Mariana Zero Mode

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
in their system,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I think it's fair to say

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
that our community

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
can't really

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
have an experiment

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
that is very confident

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
that they have

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
seen a Mariana qubit

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
in their system.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I think this is

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
a direction that

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
we are still working on.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Although I don't have

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
enough time now,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I will mention

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
that my research

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
is to use

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
various different

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
theories to find

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
different strategies

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
and systematic recipes

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
to predict

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
a Turp superconverter.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Theoretically, after making

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
such a prediction,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I will make a proposal

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
to my experiment partners

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
hoping that they can

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
really find the material

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and verify whether

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
the material is really

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
a Turp superconverter.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
In the last few minutes,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
let me give you

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
one or two examples.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
For example,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
you don't need to know

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
what it is.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I just want to emphasize

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
that this material

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
caused a stir

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
20 years ago.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
People think

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
this should be a Turp superconverter

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
because many of its properties

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
look like a Turp superconverter.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But in fact,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
the Mariana Zero Mode

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
in the nest was not seen.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Later, it should be a few years ago,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
people found that

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
some experiments were wrong.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
In fact, this kind of superconverter

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
is not a Turp superconverter.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
It is not a Turp superconverter,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and it must be

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
a superconverter

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
at a very low temperature.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
These are the shortcomings of this material.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
In the past,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
we proposed

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
that experiments

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
should be able to pull

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
or push it,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
or grow it

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
on a mold of different sizes

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
in an experimental way,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
so that its size

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
is extended or compressed.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
In this way,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
my collaborators

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
can see

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
some experimental pictures,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
but I just want to tell you

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
that you can see

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
the quality of the material

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
can be greatly changed

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
by pulling

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
or compressing it.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
In theory,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
we can predict

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that when it is pulled

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
or compressed to some extent,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
this material

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
can be easier to become a Turp superconverter,

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
and its temperature

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
will also increase.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
So this is

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
an example of what we did

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
in the past.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
There are some other works,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
but I may not have time to mention today,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
so I will only show you

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
this cover image.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
We have done various works,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and the first example

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
is that

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
we proposed

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
how to design

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
the material

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
so that the query of the Kubernetes

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
is in the same direction.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
In this way,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
it is easier to get a Turp superconverter.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Another way

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
is to introduce different

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
symmetries

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
to make the material

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
have the Marana Zero Mode.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
We also did

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
other things,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
such as using math to

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
deduce some Turp invariants,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
and then using

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
machine learning

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
to systematically

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
go through

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
the database

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
with

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
thousands of materials.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It is difficult

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
to find

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
the Turp superconverter

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
directly,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
but by using

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
the Turp invariants

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
or machine learning,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
we can systematically

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
find which materials

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
are more likely.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I don't have time

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
to talk about these details today,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
so I will stop here.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
If you have any questions,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
please feel free to ask.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
If you have any questions,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
please feel free to ask.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
If you add a magnetic field,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
you can create

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
a vortex.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Yes, the magnetic field

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
cannot be too large.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
If the magnetic field is too large,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
the superconverter will be

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
rejected,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and the magnetic field

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
will destroy the superconverter.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So we are talking about

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
a magnetic field

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
smaller than the critical B field

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
to create a vortex

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Okay, I see.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Thank you.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Hello.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I am teaching

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
at Chengda Electronics.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I started

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
doing quantum computing

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
around April this year.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
To be honest,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I have studied

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
modern physics,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and the physics I just mentioned

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
are too profound for me.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I would like to know

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
from the perspective

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
of physicists,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
that is,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
if we want to do

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
image processing,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
the special point

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
of image processing

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
is that we can take

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
a picture of millions of pixels.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
In other words,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
even if we only need

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
8 bits for a pixel,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I may need

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
8 million bits, right?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
For a quantum computer,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
it may be 8 million bits.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
8 million qubits.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
In the case of IBM's

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
more powerful quantum computer,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
it may only have

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
about 80 bits.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I would like to know

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
that physicists think

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that the difference in the number

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
of qubits,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
if we want to break through

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
an order, for example,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
to make it 10 times,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
for example,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
from 80 to 800 qubits,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
how can we make

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
a breakthrough?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I think this is

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
a very good question.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Now,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
various companies

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
have their own

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
favorite physical system.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
For example,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Google has its own,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
IBM has its own,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and Microsoft has its own.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So the method I'm talking about

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
is the method

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
of quantum computing.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Its advantage is that

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't know

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
their actual experiment.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Now they are

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
very serious about

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
this project,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
so I don't know

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
their current progress.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But I can tell you

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
that this path,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
topological quantum computing,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
its advantage is

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
that it is very small.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That is to say,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
the size of these vortexes

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
can be very close.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Then it can be very small

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
compared to other methods,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
such as IBM's method.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So it has a way to scale up.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That is to say,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
when they have a way

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
to make a qubit,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
in theory,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
they have the potential

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
to make more

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
qubits.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
In addition,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm not

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
an expert

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
in quantum computing algorithms,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
but in theory,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
if it is

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
more fault tolerant,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
you don't need

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
many physical qubits

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
to make

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
a real qubit.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So this is

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the potential

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I can see

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
in quantum computing.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But I don't know

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
whether it can be done

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
in 5 to 10 years.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But I think there is a chance.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Otherwise, these big companies

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
wouldn't invest so much

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
effort, right?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
They are doing this

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
very seriously now.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I have a second question.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It's also

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
from my research.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
We have a big problem

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
with quantum computing.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Quantum computing has

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
an uncopyability.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
When we want to

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
measure a qubit,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
we can only measure it once,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and the quantum state

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
is gone.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
We wanted to

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
find a solution.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Then I asked

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
a teacher

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
who makes materials.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
He said a very

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
well-known

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
supercomputer

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
can be used to

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
measure a qubit,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and the quantum state

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
is gone.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm not sure

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
if there is

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
any real

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
experimental evidence

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
in your field,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
or

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
if you haven't

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
heard of it.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Actually, I don't know

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
the theory of supercomputing.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I need to read

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
the article.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Otherwise,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I don't know

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
what it means.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
But this is

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
a problem.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
I can imagine

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
when you do the measurement,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
it collapses to a state.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Maybe there is a way

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
to reconstruct

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
the original state.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I've heard

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
some talks

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
trying to do this

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
with machine learning.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That's right.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
But

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
we can

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
discuss it later.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We can discuss it

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
offline.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I think what Mr. Xu said

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
is right.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
We found that

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
we have to use machine learning.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's something

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
we did recently.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
We used deep learning

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
to solve it.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But I think

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
physicists may need

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
to solve

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
these two problems.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I think these are

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
the two bottlenecks.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Interesting.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We can discuss it later.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Thank you.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Hello.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Please go ahead.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I can't

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
turn on

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
the camera.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So I will

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
speak directly.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I'm a professor at

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
the Department of Mass Physics.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
My name is Gao Xianzhong.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I have a question.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Someone asked

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
if you are a

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
topological superconductor

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
you are a type 2 superconductor

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and you add a magnetic field,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
there may be

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
a zero-dimension

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
marinara mode

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
near the

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
vortex core.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I want to ask

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
that

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
in general,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
in many cases,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
when you add a magnetic field,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
it doesn't

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
form a single flux core.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
For example,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
it may form

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
a Bricose-off-Lattice.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
There will be many cores.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yes.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Are these

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
cores

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
equal to

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
the magnetic field

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
on the material

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
divided by the magnetic field of the unit?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This is a good question.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I haven't

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
thought about it.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
It sounds reasonable.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
We can discuss the details later.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I want to

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
emphasize that

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I only draw one here,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
but if it is

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
an application like

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
quantum computing,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
it really needs a lot.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Because it is

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
a pair of

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
vortex plus

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
a zero-dimension

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
marinara mode.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It is not

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
a single thing.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Of course, we don't

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
only need one core.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
We need many cores.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I think

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the question you just asked

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
is very important.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
If we need many cores,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
we need to know

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
the size of the material

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
and the magnetic field.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I haven't thought about it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I can't answer you

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
precisely now.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
We can talk about it later.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Let me

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
ask the question in the chat.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Hello, I am Xiong Weiren.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I am currently doing research

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
in the Central Academy of Medicine.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It is said that electrons

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
have the same

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
mode of action

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
at extremely low temperature,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
such as superconductivity.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But what is the direction

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of superconductivity

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
at room temperature?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Let me

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
try to understand

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
your question.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
What I said

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
at the beginning

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
is that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
in fact,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
there are several modes

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
of action at extremely low temperature,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
such as superconductivity

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
or magnetism.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Or the charge density wave

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I just showed you.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Electrons will

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
show the pattern

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
of the beam.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
There are several patterns.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
One of them is superconductivity.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But we can ask

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
what is the nature of superconductivity?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Is it helpful

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
in application?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
The answer is that it has no damage,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
so it is very good.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
We hope to apply it

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
to our daily life,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
such as various appliances

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
or wires,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
right?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
That's why people want to

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
ask if there is superconductivity

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
at room temperature.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Is there any way to see

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
superconductivity at room temperature?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That's the motivation.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But you can ask

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
if there is

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
actually a way to do it.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Recently,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
many articles

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
are trying to

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
say that they have seen

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
superconductivity at room temperature,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
but there are some controversies.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The general principle

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
is that you have to add a lot of pressure.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
There must be a trade-off.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
You can see it

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
at low temperature,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
or you can see it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
at room temperature,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
but you have to add a lot of pressure.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That's what I've heard so far.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Of course,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
there are some famous examples,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
such as the so-called high-temperature superconductor,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
which is also

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
negative 200 degrees C.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It's still very low-temperature,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but it's over 100 degrees higher

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
than the original one.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This kind of high-temperature superconductor

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
relies on the progress of the material.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That is to say, they make

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
some copper-based superconductors.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
It's obviously a ceramic material.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It should be insoluble,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
but at low temperature,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
at minus 200 degrees,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
it may become a superconductor.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Another direction

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
is to understand

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
such a feature,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
which is a high-temperature superconductor,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
its surrounding physical mechanism,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and then

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
to find out

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
if the surrounding physical mechanism

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
can amplify the behavior

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
in different material families.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Some people also pursue

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
this kind of logic

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
to see if there is any way

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
to make other materials at room temperature,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
without adding a lot of pressure.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I hope I have answered your question.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Thank you, Mr. Xu,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
for your wonderful speech.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Is there any other material

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
that may not be a superconductor?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
For example,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
double-layered stainless steel?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Hello?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Can you hear me?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Yes, yes, yes.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You can talk about the last part.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Does it stop at double-layered stainless steel?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
For example,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
double-layered stainless steel?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Oh, I see.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Is it possible that

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
double-layered stainless steel

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
is a candidate?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Yes, yes, it is possible.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
That's a good question.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Double-layered stainless steel

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
is a very popular material recently.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It is a double-layered stainless steel.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It can actually be done.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Then they will turn it

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
in a small angle.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
The reason is that

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
it can be used to

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
control the interaction between

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
electrons and electrons,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
or the size of the interaction

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
between the two.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
If the interaction is more effective,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
the superconductor

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
can have

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
all kinds of different

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
quantum states.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
One of them is the superconductor.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It has not been fully

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
confirmed yet,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
but many theories,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
including some of my own work,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
predict that

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
in such a system,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
when you have some

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
parameters on the material,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
how to adjust them,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
it is indeed possible that it is a top superconductor.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So this is possible.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Some of my past work

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
has also predicted

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
a lot of double-layered materials

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
similar to stainless steel,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
like the hexagonal material just now,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
where each atom is not

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
carbon, but some other

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
transition metal, etc.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There are some other

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
atoms in the cycle table.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
If you put it there,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
it is another type of

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
transition metal that can be

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
collagenized.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Those can also be

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
torn apart layer by layer

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
with 3M tape.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I have some work to predict

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
that it may also be a superconductor.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Okay.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Next question.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Hello, I am Hong Shi-An.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I am currently doing my PhD at NIST.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Since I have not studied

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
topological quantum

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
QC, quantum computing,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I would like to ask

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
which two states

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
can be used

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
as 0 and 1?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Why can it be immutable

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
to localized noise?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
This is a big question.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
For more details,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I can recommend

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
a very good

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
review article

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
called Review of Modern Physics

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
by RMP.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
In general,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
it is not only

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
0 and 1.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Generally,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
it does not have to be

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
topological quantum computing.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
As long as it is quantum computing,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
it uses a quantum state

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
to store information.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
In the quantum state,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
it is not

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
100%

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
or 1%

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
but

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
a probability.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
For example,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
50% is 0,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
50% is 1,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
etc.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It is a spectrum.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
It is not

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
limited to

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
0 and 1.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
It can store information

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
in various proportions.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
There are more ways

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
to store information.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
When you ask

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
what 0 and 1 are,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
it does not have

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
a direct correspondence.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It is difficult to explain directly.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Simply put,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I did not say

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
that qubits can be used

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
to store information.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
For example,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
half-quantum vortex

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
can be used

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
as a qubit.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
There are many qubits.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
All of them

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
can have

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
high degeneracy

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
in such a state.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Many configurations

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
have the same energy.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
When you do

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
some braiding

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
to exchange

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
their positions,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
etc.,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
you can jump

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
from one degenerate state

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
to another degenerate state.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
This is a

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
kind of operation.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Hilbert states

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
can store

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
information

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
corresponding to

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
only 0 and 1.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
It is not easy

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
to explain in detail.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
If you have

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
any questions,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
we can

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
discuss offline later.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
The reason why

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I say it is

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
immune to localized noise

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
is that

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
the qubits are

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
composed of

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
a pair of half-quantum vortex

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and a pair of

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
degenerate states.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
They are entangled,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
but they can be

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
in two different places.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
When you jump from

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
one degenerate state

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
to another,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
you can only

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
jump from

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
one degenerate state

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
to another

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
by braiding.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Other operations

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
are not sensitive to noise.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
That's why I say

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
it is immune to localized noise.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Unless you have

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
a special noise

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
that can

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
braid two different qubits.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
If you can

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
find a noise

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
that can do this,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
it can't be immune

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
to localized noise.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I hope I can

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
answer your question.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Okay.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
The last two questions

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
are from the same person.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Hello,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I'm Zhang Zhiyuan.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I'm currently studying at Tsinghua University.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I'd like to ask

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
if Marijuana

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Zero Mode

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
is stable

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
or

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
will it decay

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
after some time?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Also,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
do you always

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
use the first law

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
or do you use

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
different methods

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
to study the theory of

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
denatured states?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
That's a good question.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
The first question is

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
that it is an eigenstate.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
It is a Hamiltonian

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
eigenstate,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
so it is a stable state.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Theoretically,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
it shouldn't decay

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Another question is

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
that I don't use the first law.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I have a lot of

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
collaborators who use the first law.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
What I do is

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
from

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
mean field theory

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
to

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
mean field theory,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
renormalization group,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
diagrammatic calculation,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
and

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
we also use

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
k-theory

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
to deduce the

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
unchangeable number,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
topological invariant,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
and then work with

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
collaborators using the first law

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
to calculate

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
the number

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
deduced

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
from the

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
material library.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
OK.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
That's all for

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
the first part of the

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Q&A.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Please turn on

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
the microphone

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
to thank

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Professor Xu.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Thank you.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Let me

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
turn off

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
the recording first.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
OK.
