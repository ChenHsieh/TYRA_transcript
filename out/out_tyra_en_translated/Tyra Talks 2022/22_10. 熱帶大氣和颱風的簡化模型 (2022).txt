Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech on April 16, 2022.
The speaker we invited today is Jian Muhua.
He graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Atmospheric Engineering.
After graduation, he explored his own interests in Taiwan for a few years, such as running a super marathon.
In 2016, he went to the University of New York to study mathematics.
In 2018, he continued to study at the University of New York's Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology.
His speech today is on the simplification model of hot air and typhoons.
We are looking forward to his speech.
According to TAIRA's tradition, please turn on your microphones.
Let's applaud and welcome Jian Muhua.
Now I will give the floor to Jian Muhua.
Thank you, Shi-An.
I am very happy to be able to come to TAIRA to share my own research.
This is my current research topic.
Because there are some relatively professional parts in the content.
I just saw that many participants are actually people in our field.
So I still maintain the original way of speaking.
If you are interested, we can discuss it later in the message.
I am Jian Muhua.
I am Jian Muhua.
I am a program student at the Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology at the University of New York.
This program mainly deals with atmospheric or ocean topics related to application mathematics.
I will start.
Let me introduce myself.
I am a son of a person.
My mother is also listening.
I recently became a father.
I am a child.
I recently took care of my son in Taiwan.
I also ran a super marathon.
I am also a PhD student at NYU.
I am also engaged in relevant initiatives on Taiwan issues.
I studied at a university in Taiwan.
I also studied at NYU.
I also took part in activities in Taiwan community.
I also took part in our school community meetings.
The following are the activities I have held.
I have been to many of these events.
I will start today's topic.
Today's topic is the atmosphere in the heat wave.
What can we see in the heat wave?
I don't know what to see.
So I found a photo from NASA first.
It is a photo taken from space to the earth.
We can see a lot of clouds.
This is the first thing to see.
The second thing is that we can see a hot air balloon in the photo.
Or everyone thinks this is a typhoon.
I think as an atmospheric researcher,
It is inevitable that we must bring this issue to our living environment.
This is related to climate change.
My question is related to climate change.
How will the heat wave change when the climate changes?
Or what kind of impact will the change have on us?
Because my topic is not about the impact.
So I will talk about what kind of impact it will have.
The emergence of extreme weather events is directly affected by climate change.
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.
When the environment changes, the typhoon may become stronger.
In the past few years, we have felt drought or extreme rainfall in Taiwan.
Extreme weather events may increase.
This is my own view.
I think we have studied this topic for a long time.
For example, we have studied this topic for a long time.
But in fact, there are still some uncertainties in understanding this issue.
There are still many uncertainties in forecasting or understanding this matter.
We can give an approximate situation.
Most of these uncertain factors come from the clouds we see in this photo.
That is, the impact of water vapor in the physical system.
So my topic today is actually about water vapor.
If you are in our field, you will know that this is probably the part of atmospheric thermodynamics.
Today is a simple introduction.
Before the next video, I think what I want to say is a bit like this.
We want to know the impact of extreme events on us.
We have to understand our original state first.
Or what is the physical structure behind it?
Or what is the mathematical structure?
We can say how many degrees we have changed today.
How will the climate change?
If you don't have a background knowledge, you know what its original state is.
Or what is the physics behind it?
You can't know what it will become after it changes.
So today's speech will focus on its background state.
Before we start, we know what the background state is.
What is stability? What is instability?
Stability is what we can observe.
We can know what it is without artificial influence.
Or what it is like in the original physical structure.
I found a simple concept on the Internet.
What is stability? What is instability?
First, we can imagine it as a bowl.
There is a ball in the bowl.
When you put the ball in, the ball will roll to the lowest point of the bowl.
How do you move? You push the ball a little bit.
Or you give it a certain range of force.
It won't leave the bottom of the bowl too far.
Then we will call this state stability.
If you put the bowl in the opposite direction,
Or you put the ball on a slope,
The ball will roll to a far place.
Then this situation is not stable.
The third situation is neutral.
It is a neutral state.
The ball can roll anywhere.
It may be relatively stable in any place.
I think what I want to say is that our climate is more inclined to this state.
We have a stable state.
But in the case of climate change, we may become another situation.
It will have a new stability.
Another stability can be more stable.
But this is from point A to point B.
There may be more extreme events.
Or fewer extreme events.
Or a certain extreme event, such as more droughts.
Or there will be more rainfall.
We still need to do more research.
But before all this, we can still understand the stability of state A.
What is the material behind it?
So today's story will probably focus on what our atmosphere is.
Okay, let's start the topic now.
The first point after entering the topic is what we want to talk about.
The first point is buoyancy.
When I was in middle school, buoyancy was a difficult topic.
At that time, the teacher gave a big concept.
That is, buoyancy equals gravity.
What is gravity?
If we see a object floating on an object,
The object floating on the object can hold its weight.
So this buoyancy can hold its weight.
Of course, it can also be said that we can dig out the original fluid.
Then it can replace its weight.
Then it can extend to the second and third layers.
If I have an object sinking in the middle today.
Or it happens to float in this fluid.
Then we know that the density of this thing or the weight of this thing is equal to the weight of the buoyancy.
That is to say, the density of these two things is basically the same.
The next situation is that the density of this thing is relatively large.
Then it will sink to the bottom.
So buoyancy can't support the original weight.
That buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid in this space.
What about the concept of buoyancy?
How do we apply it to the atmosphere?
This is a participant in this experiment.
Come and listen to this speech.
How do we know that the density distribution is in the vertical atmosphere?
Because if we know the density distribution, we know that the object will sink down or float up.
In a direct way, we measure its temperature and air pressure.
We can know that the density of the ideal gas equation.
Of course, we can't measure it at every height.
The simplest way is to close a balloon and let the balloon fly up.
In the process of flying, it will record the temperature and air pressure at each height.
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.
Then we know the density of each layer of air.
We can know the desitny of each layer of air.
Before we do this, we can do another thing.
Before we do this, we can do another thing.
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.
It is reduced with height.
However, the pressure is reduced with height.
The pressure is reduced with height.
On the left chart,
On the left chart,
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.
More than 1,000 times roaring.
More than 1,000 times roaring.
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.
It may be 100 times roaring.
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.
This is the anti-intuition thing.
This is the anti-intuition thing.
The temperature is getting lower.
The temperature is getting lower.
However, the density is getting smaller.
The deeper the water water boils,
The deeper the water boils,
The deeper the water boils,
The deeper the water boils,
The larger the temperature,
The larger the temperature of the lower ?
The lower the temperature of the lower channel.
The lower the temperature of the earth's heat,
The lower the river is.
This is an interesting thing.
This is an interesting thing.
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric
How do we know that
How do we know that
The stable atmosphere we just thought about
How do we discuss
How do we discuss
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.
To measure this atmosphere,
To measure this atmosphere,
Just use the imagined way
Just use the imagined way
Just use the imagined way
I�e balloons
For example, the height here
For example, the height here
I put a balloon
I move it somewhere else
And see when
I move it somewhere else
When, at a specified height
Will the balloon move up
Or down
And say
And say
Is the atmosphere stable
Is the atmosphere stable
No
No
Is the atmosphere stable
No
Will that be strange
We often have birthday parties
Or sometimes when there's a party
Or sometimes when there's a party
Balloon
It's usually inside
The balloon
It's usually floating in the air
We can put that
Relax
The balloon will float up
That
The process of floating up the balloon
The higher the effect
If we are outdoors
The garlic will explode
Will it break
That's
She just
Have you wondered why
Why
The reason is because
The pressure on the environment changes
After you put the balloon on
That means your balloon
The original air will get more and more
Expansion
After the expansion
The outer layer of yours
No way
Support you
When the pressure
The balloon will explode
That means
We
What I just said
If we move the A balloon to the B balloon
It's not actually
A to B
It's like this
In the process
It will slowly expand
What is the principle of expansion
Oops
The principle of expansion
It's actually the first law of thermodynamics
That is
The first law of thermodynamics
In another idea
Our heating will be equal to the change in temperature
Plus
Uh, plus
Uh, heating is equal to temperature change
If you are a gas
Because it will expand
So
So you have to add
The effect of expansion
Uh
That
The balloon we just talked about
That balloon
It's actually not heated
So in this process
It's actually
The temperature reduction in the process of ascension will be equal to
Uh, the change in pressure
So
Look at this picture on the right
We assume that there is a 25
The balloon of degree C
That balloon
Because it is
Because it is a balloon
So it won't have a quality exchange with the outside world
You won't have
Uh, the air outside runs in
You won't have
The air inside runs out
Then it won't have heat exchange
I won't pass the heat out
Go outside
And the heat outside
Won't pass in
So
This balloon
In the process of rising and falling
In the process of rising
It will
Its temperature will decrease
Its volume will expand
If the balloon moves down above
It is
The balloon will be compressed
Then the volume will shrink
Then the temperature will rise
That
This is a
Is the atmosphere
It's a
Theorem or we use this concept to push us
To understand that
Hey, what is this atmosphere like?
Uh, I just talked about
What I just said is that
Hey, our atmosphere is actually layered
That is, each layer of atmosphere
In fact, it has
It has a temperature
So how do we measure this temperature?
Uh
Uh, is the atmosphere stable?
We
Integrated
Uh, the atmosphere
Assuming it is stable
And then integrate the first law of thermodynamics that we just used
We can actually deduce
A thing called
Uh, it's right here
And this thing on top is
I was given
I was shown to my friends
I was shown to people who were interested in the equation
Then I won't go into the equation room to talk too much
That
Why is this value important?
We can see that it is the middle line
This cloud
He
Oops
He
His concept is that our atmosphere is stable
If it goes up by 1 km
Down 9.8 degrees
That's a bit like saying
If we have a 30 degree C balloon on the surface today
Then this balloon
When we move it to 2000 meters
It will drop 20 degrees
So it's 10 degrees
When it goes up to 4,000 meters
It will drop another 20 degrees
So he is
Negative 10 degrees
That's it
Uh, vertical distribution
That's what we just talked about
The first law of thermodynamics tells us
The result is that in the same process
The balloon
It's going up 2,000 meters, going down 10 degrees, and then it's going to explode
And then it goes down
It will go up another 2,000 meters, it will go down another 20 degrees
And then it will explode again
What about the idea he told us?
That's the other two
That is, uh, if I say
Today's temperature drops slower
For example, this case on the left
It's 30 degrees on the surface
It's 15 degrees at 2,000 meters
That means this case is stable
Because if I put
30 degrees of this
It's the balloon at 30 degrees on the surface
If you move it up 2,000 meters
It will be 10 degrees
So it will be colder
But my environment is
Uh, 15 degrees
So the colder air
Relatively hot air
It will sink
So the case on the left is stable
Because you move 30 degrees to 2,000 meters
It will be 10 degrees
So the environment is 15 degrees
So this air will sink
It's relatively stable
Then we are more interesting
Of course it's the case on the other side
It's the temperature it drops
It's every 2,000 meters
The drop in temperature is more than 20 degrees
It's the case on the right
It's 30 degrees to 2,000 meters
It will drop 25 degrees
Then go back to this value reduction rate
Just the middle line
I found out that this is
10 degrees
But if I drop 25 degrees
It means 25 degrees
That is
The air I moved up
In fact, it is relatively light
So it will continue to run up
What about this structure
It's actually unstable
That means
Uh, if I
Over this value reduction rate
It's the temperature that drops more
It's unstable
Um, let me think about it
Uh, here we are
It's the idea of stability and instability
This idea is in the atmosphere
If we only consider dry air
It has a dry straight line
The one in the middle is my reference state
It's a relatively stable state
Then you just have to be
More stable than reference state
It's more stable
It's more stable than reference
It will be adjusted to
It's reference state
Let's go to the next page
Next page
Here is a more common one
It's a common concept in the atmosphere
It's called temperature
It's actually
If it's in a more common field
In a more common scientific field
We will use
That's the natural
That natural injury
But here we don't have to talk about
How to reverse injury operation
The concept we want to use is
If we don't give
If we don't heat up our system
Then his injury will be stable
that
We say temperature or injury is stable
Uh, conservative
In fact, it means
Hey, we didn't heat it up
No quality exchange
In fact, it is conservative
Then you can go back to the picture of that page
Just the picture of that page
After we calculate its temperature
In fact, you can get a
A simpler concept is
If my temperature
On each vertical layer
It's all
If it's a constant
Then the air on this layer is stable
It's neutral
It's neutral
Then if its
Temperature increases with height
For example, the one on the left
It was 30 degrees, 15 degrees and negative 5
It is 303 308
And 313
Its absolute temperature increases with the water
It means that this layer is stable
That's the other side
It's on the right
Its temperature decreases with height
That's not stable
Okay, this one
This is a
It's kind of a good idea
We can know right away
that
The atmosphere is
That is, if we know its temperature
We can know right away
That is, if we know its temperature
We can know right away
The whole thing is stable or not
That
We are in
In everyday life
Or when we just observed the balloon
We just know
We're going to convert it back to its temperature
Most of the time
The air is stable
Because it's all
It's the middle or the left side of this case
Because if it's unstable
It will have a flow and then let
The hot air goes up and the cold air comes down
Then it will go back to
Stable state
This is a bit like
As long as
As long as we have bad guys
Then the bad guys will be
Be
Everyone is trained to be a better person
In this way, in the end
In our environment
You'll see more
It's all stable
This state
it is good
it is good
Wait a minute
Yeah, this one
I want to ask a question
I want to ask a question
Okay, I think I think
I think this is a good one
I think this is a good one
That cutting point is
If you have any questions here
If you have any questions here
I think we can
Pause
Pause
Okay, I'm just asking a very
Okay, I'm just asking a very
It should be
This is the professional field
I think it's a boring question
This is the 303 you talked about
308 313k
This is SETA
This is SETA
OK
Sorry
This is the so-called temperature, right?
Yes, it is the so-called temperature
But actually we are in
This is what we often use in the field
Using kelvin
Use absolute temperature to express
This why I use absolute temperature
The reason is because
It can be different from the temperature
Such
Yes
Its unit is
Use
Yes
Use temperature to express temperature
OK
it is good
Just up
Just up to this point
The concept is that it is
Uh
It's not
It's not water
it is good
After the water is involved
The problem will become more complicated
Then we can know that
In the balloon just now
If we catch it now
In the air of the earth
It will have gas oxygen carbon dioxide
Then it will also have water
That's why
For example, people living in the United States
It will feel that the air is dry
Because its water may be less
People in Taiwan
I feel that there is more water
Is the abundance of water
In fact, in addition to affecting the comfort of our life
In addition
It will also affect the stability of the atmosphere
The picture on the right
It was also caught by me in Wikipedia
This thing is
This story is like this
Uh
We are in the process of atmospheric vertical movement
In the process of atmospheric vertical movement
The temperature will be
The temperature will be reduced
In the process of temperature reduction
He will encounter a situation
The temperature is low
The water will freeze
It's a bit like we're in the air
It's a bit like the state of fog
that is
If the air cools down quickly
That water
Uh
The water is the water
The frozen water pressure is on the right
Will
Will
Will let the steam
Become
Atmospheric water
That process
Uh he
He is not linear
He needs a more complicated formula to calculate
Then this process is actually more
It's more difficult to capture
It's more difficult to understand
That's it
So when we think about water
Just mentioned earlier
The process of stability
There is a new one
There is a new interpretation
That is, when water becomes steam
When it becomes steam
It will release some heat
What about the first law of thermodynamics we just learned
There will be one
There will be a heating on our right
On the right
So our up and down adjustment process
Also add
The adjustment of the heat of the water
Then we can get another one
It's the ratio of cooling
It's the ratio of cooling when there's water
He usually calls us this
It's called visual heat reduction rate
That is, you can imagine that he is
Moisture lapse rate
When there is water
We have another cooling rate
Then his cooling rate is more
Smaller
It's just dry
It drops by 9.8 degrees per kilometer
But when you have water
It only drops by about 6 degrees per kilometer
Then there is a thing here
Just a little reminder
Uh 9.8
Just that 9.8 degrees
Because the formula he calculated is a constant
So
Uh
It won't change with the height
That visual heat reduction rate
This 6.5 is a estimate value
It's a non-linear value
So you can think about this company is so complicated
Then it will change with the height
So 6.5 is a kind of estimate value
Then follow
With different heights
It has different
The gradient
Then in the process
We can at the same time
Define another temperature
Is related to
Water
This temperature is called
Uh, relative temperature
Relative temperature
Relative temperature is also
You can think of it as a wet temperature
After adding water vapor
He can get the result
That
Because the water vapor is really complicated
Then we can see that
It's wet
The relative temperature equation is here
Then I don't have to explain
What's in it
But he
It is a fairly complicated value
Very complicated calculation
But if we calculate
After this relative temperature value
He actually
The concept of application will be quite simple
it is good
it is good
Then
Next we want to introduce
Is that we want to introduce
When there is water vapor
The atmosphere will have a
Another state occurs
It is called
Unstable condition
That
Uh, what about this picture
If we don't look
Don't look at this part of the unstable condition
Just look at this
The part of the dry heat dissipation rate
We can go back to just
Just review
The result we just got
If our cooling rate
Uh, this gamma is its cooling rate
must
that is
This symbol is upside down
That is, we are lower than the temperature
If the temperature of the dry heat dissipation rate is more than
Or if our temperature is
If the water level is low, this
This is our atmosphere
Unstable
Then what if
Uh, the other condition is
If our atmosphere is
More than this
If the cooling rate is lower
It is stable
So on the other side
Relatively stable
Uh, this side
it is good
But when we have water vapor
After considering
What about
What about
We have another condition
Unstable occurrence
The situation in the unstable condition is
Uh, it's in the cooling rate
It's in
Uh, let me see
It's in the middle of negative 9.8 to negative 6.5
Because there's a negative sign here
So it's
I'm easy to get this wrong
I was right
I just
Ten minutes before the start
Ten minutes to change the first film
I changed it wrong
So here's a condition
The unstable situation is
In the middle
Its atmosphere is actually
Unstable
Then it will adjust to
To this stability
That is to say
If it has water vapor
Or if it has
If it has water vapor
It will be
Unstable conditions
It will produce flow
What about the formula for its judgment
In fact, you can see
Imagine that it is the temperature
Is increasing with the height
But its
Relatively low temperature is decreasing with the height
That's the case
In fact, it meets
Unstable
The conditions
Uh
Uh, good
I'm going to
I'm going to
I'm going to
I'm going to
I'm going to
I'm going to
I'm not sure if this is a very complicated
The idea
But we go to the next page
This idea will be relatively useful
Ok, now we finally have to see
What is the heat generation
What about the heat generation
Uh
Its situation is
If we are on a ocean
This ocean will absorb radiation from the sun
And then it will heat our surface
And then there's another thing
When a object has temperature
It will have long-wave radiation
A lot of radiation
The radiation goes out
Will send the heat out
So it will produce a
Is
System
Then there will be heat coming in and heat going out
And then
Uh, we only rely on radiation
Its heat cannot be adjusted to a stable state
So it will have a flow to help
The whole atmosphere is adjusted
That's our
Uh, the story
Simplified, simplified, simplified version
Of course, in the atmosphere
It will have
The difference in the ocean
And then it will have different
Uh, background
Atmospheric circulation
And then it will have
Maybe there are a lot of people doing air glue
Uh, there will be different physical phenomena
Will affect
It's the change of the heat generation
But what I'm talking about here is a bit like his
Is that you can do everything
Ignore the parts that can be ignored
What you can get is
This system I just talked about
That right
This is a picture from the textbook
What it describes is
Its y-axis is the height
Then its x-axis is from 90 degrees south to 90 degrees north
So it's a
Uh, I put every
The upper temperature of the latitude is
Average value
So this is the latitude above
Then the following is the latitude
Then we can see the latitude value
It's just that it's not very clear
But its latitude
In fact, it is increased by the height of the water, so it means that
We are in the channel or in the heat generation atmosphere
The temperature is increased by the height of the water
Which
Uh, in line with what we just saw
This condition
The temperature is increased by the height of the water
What about the following picture
Is quite low temperature
Then we can see that in the heat generation area
In fact, it's all the same value
It means
In the heat generation atmosphere
Its relative temperature is actually
A constant is a constant with the height
That means most of the time it is maintained
In a state that has just been adjusted
Or it's a neutral state
There must be a process
In the process is
Uh, solar heating or other non-thermal processes
Put
This atmosphere becomes unstable
Then it is adjusted by the flow
Stable
Then this picture tells us that in fact
This flow is in
It is very common in the heat generation atmosphere
It's just that it's a very common phenomenon
That's why
My research is to study the process of wet flow
How is it
it is good
The next page is
Uh, this page is
I call it magic step
Just
Uh, we want to understand this system
But the atmosphere system is actually very complicated
I just said
If you want to consider everything
You want to consider
You want to consider
Uh, water, you want to consider B, you want to consider rain, you want to consider radiation
All this process you will
You will write out a super complicated
Mathematical model
Then you will
A super complicated fluid model, you have to consider the density, you have to consider all kinds of changes
But I actually went back to it
I'm in the traditional flow problem
Plus
A simplified state equation
To describe that if today
Produce
When it is saturated
How will its heat release change?
This simple equation
Replaced by a very complicated thermal equation
Or replaced by a very complicated
The process of microphysis is to simplify everything
Simplify to me
It's only saturated and then it's unstable
In this state
To write out
This equation
Give
Give
It's just a little bit more information
This time it's not a fluid
It's just that it's simplified like this
Then it is driven by buoyancy
The whole system
Then we
Uh, this
This, this is to use the temperature and the relative temperature to adjust its buoyancy
That
That's not it
This is not
This is not the original form in my original paper
But it's very close
We can look at that form
Then he also
For super super good people in thermodynamics
This is not a very exact
This is not
A very exact equation
and so
If you need more details
That's what we'll discuss later
Then why can we do this
Why can we do this equation
Can help us understand
It should be said
Or what kind of simplification did I do?
That's what we just said
The atmosphere is actually on the ocean
Then he has the top of the fluid
Then he is
There is no lid on the top of the fluid
But I put the fluid in two lids
Oops
Put it in two lids
Then I add
Plus the process of condensation
Then I add the unstable
This fluid
Unstable conditions
This condition is not a condition
Unstable condition
This state
I gave him a relatively low temperature
Then he is
The low temperature is greater than zero
Give him this condition
Then if it meets some conditions
It will produce
That is, it will be saturated and release heat
Simply put
Inside my model
If it is saturated, it will go
Its buoyancy is determined by its relative low temperature
So it is unstable
If I say my model
I judge it is
It is stable without saturation
So this
To some extent
It meets the condition of instability
This state is
Stable without saturation
Stable with saturation
Then this
What about such a fluid
In fact, it will
It needs a distribution
It won't be a
It's me today
Just pull a balloon up
I know that there is saturation here
There is no saturation here
It will be a
It is
It will be a
Distribution
Some places have flow
Some places have no flow
It is going down
Some places are going up
Then there is an animation on the bottom page
This is my simulation animation
Then I think this animation can give you some
The idea is to know
What is this flow
That's the same as if
This is the same as what we know
The atmosphere model is quite similar
Or if it is
A little bit like the weather phenomenon we know
At the beginning I gave some
Just random perturbation
Then after a while
It will have a flow
In this process
By the way, let me describe
What is my model
This is my
The equation above me just now
Is to use
Uncompressible package
Uncompressible program to
Solve the above equation
Then this
The program is
Can have
Is adaptive mesh
I'm not sure what to say
It can be mesh
Detailed to
Can have dynamic mesh
Then it is in
Ccse developed by Perkin Lab
Then if
For those of you who have studied the numerical method
It is the numerical method of
The
Then
Solve
Under the condition that it is uncompressible
We use approximate projection
Is to use a method to solve
Just
Solve this limitation of uncompressible flow
Then we can see
This is the addition of rotation
So
So after a while
Numerical simulation
Then the random flow we just talked about
Will become
It's like a typhoon
This kind of spiral
What about this spiral
In fact, it is
There are many similar places to typhoons
Then it will
It will also die
Then it will grow a new flow
Then it has
Is that it has an upper and lower layer
We can talk about the upper layer area
The upper layer area is the typhoon
That lower layer area is
It's just that there is no water here
The place is its lower layer area
That
This simplified model
I'm not sure if I can convince everyone
It is to some extent
Captured a lot of atmospheric features
That
We use
To understand this simplified model
To understand that
The original atmosphere
Or what is the atmosphere
Come
Come and do further research
That
Let's go to the next page
I haven't jumped to the next page yet
Then we have some more
Simple
It should be said that it is not simple
Anyway, it is more
Uh
A more static picture to see
Look at what my simulation results tell us
Or
What are these things
Is related to atmospheric
Similar
That
The two on the left are
Uh
A time screenshot
That left
Uh
What about this A picture
It is not
No rotation
The right one has rotation
Then we can see that there is no rotation
It will have
Is the ascending area
There are some currents in
In
In
Inside my simulation area
Then there is another place
Is the descent area
This way
Then the other side of the picture is
I put the rotation into my
In the simulation conditions
It will produce a vortex like a typhoon
Good
You will see a few
Several such
Vortex
Okay, then I put these vortexes
Go to the mirror
Is to do
Along its
Half into the average
We can see a lot
Some features like typhoons
Let's take a look at the above
This picture
It is
It is
The color is the vertical speed
So it will have
The speed of the center rise
It will also have
There is a descent in the center
It's a bit like a typhoon
Typhoon eye
The other one
Is contour
Its horizontal line
Is
The content of liquid water
So it rises in the center
There are more liquid water
So this is like us
I don't understand typhoons
We have also seen the satellite image of typhoons
Is in the center of the typhoon
There will be a lot of clouds
There will be a lot of water and a lot of rain
So this is to some extent
Close to our understanding of typhoons
What about the next one
Is
Uh, it's a typhoon
Mirror wind and oblique wind
Is
There is a lower layer
That
The color is the mirror wind
It has
The lower layer is from the outside
Into the typhoon center
The wind
Then it will decrease with the height
It will fly out from the upper layer
The upper layer flows out
Then this is accompanied by
Is the oblique wind
That this
In the atmosphere
It meets some
Uh, what is this
Is the slope wind
The slope wind
What is the slope wind
Is the slope wind
The
The
The model is like this
What about the third picture
It is
Uh, it's quite unsteady
With its angular momentum
That in
There is a famous paper in the atmosphere
It has a narrative
Say it is
A narrative
Uh, an ideal spiral
Its angular momentum
With its relative unsteady
To some extent
Just his
The line must be relatively parallel
That
In this result
In this part
It is also relatively parallel
So it means that this spiral
It is with
It is quite similar to the ideal typhoon model
it is good
it is good
This is the last picture with information
This picture is also a little bit complicated
But
Uh, I think the reason I want to show this picture is because
Because we talked about so much in the front
Wei Wen talked so much about injury
That this picture is actually the concept of application injury
To divide my level
That is, I put the injury of each level
Every block of different injuries
Collected
Then go and say
My
The atmosphere of my different injuries
In the end, the blocks of different injuries
How is it distributed
Okay, what about this one above?
The above one is
Uh, its distribution
There is a white line here
If you can see it, it is
It is
Uh, the condensation line
That is, if I am in
The upper right of this line represents these air
Is condensed
These blocks are condensed
Then there is no condensation below
Then we can find out
In
If there is no rotation
Inside the case is
Uh, this
This kind of
Under this state
Most of it
The air is not condensed
Then there will be a small part of it
Is condensed
Uh, the condensed air is relatively small
Then
In addition, if there is a spiral
It has more
Less proportion
There will be an upward spiral
Then there are more parts of the lower layer
So its upper layer
The upper and lower layers are more open
This is the lower layer area
Then this is the upper layer area
Then there is no
The upper layer area without rotation is here
So its upper and lower
The upper and lower areas can be separated
Then below this is a
In uh
A fairly low temperature
It can distinguish its upper and lower
What is it like in a vertical movement
that
Uh, when there is a rotation
His upper body is
More will not be
Uh environment to
Mix is if he
It should be said that his upper body movement is better protected
So his upper body
It's just that his heat transmission efficiency is
More effective
Then this
This way of analysis is actually
Is a
I think it's a bit smart
No, it's not
Because this is not my way
This is my boss's way
He provided everyone with a
Provided everyone with a
To understand from the point of view of injury
Hey, what about our big team
that
Cut back on the idea at the beginning
Just when i have
Something with a bigger benefit
Or something with a bigger injury
When the block is running up
That
The smaller block of the injury is running down
But he has one
Is relatively wet
The air block has more potential to run up
Relatively dry block
He just runs down
This picture tells us to some extent
This thing
Okay, today
I think my sharing is probably here
Then there are a few things to remind everyone
Is lapse rate
Is
The value reduction rate is directly affected
Directly related to our climate change
Is if you
Just said
If these things don't make sense to you
Then we can still go back to one thing
That is, lapse rate is actually
Our background
Our
Stability
Our physical structure is there
He won't change because of climate change
Add two degrees
That
So
Lapse rate is really
Directly related to climate change
Then the second thing is
Uh
Just now we talked about heat and air
Is a relatively complex process
Is that he has
Various things
Then the stability of light is so complicated
You can imagine
If we consider all kinds of different physics
For example, consider radiation
Consider microphysics
Consider gas
How complicated it can become
Then I will
My research is counterproductive
I will take all these complicated things
Take it all
Then
After simplifying this mode
Then use numerical simulation
To solve
To
To solve this equation
To understand that this
Rise and fall
How to distribute
Then this mode
He has another advantage
Is that he can make it soundless
The analysis becomes simpler
That
Of course I don't want to talk about this today
This part
But it is
Is a simplified mode
Then he can give us a lot
Different information
Then the last one
Take home message is
Uh, wet flow
The thing is
Wet things go up
Dry things come down
That uh
In case this
This sentence doesn't make sense
It doesn't make sense to everyone
Is that we have a cloud
The place is rising
Then there are many places
It's downstream
It's downstream
The place is much more than the place that rises
Then this is a feature of wet flow
That
Uh, maybe some friends who do flow
He will say
His flow is
The rise and fall are symmetrical
That wet flow is
It's not symmetrical
And the wet flow has a very clear boundary
Cut up the rise and fall
The more you cut
Your wet flow
Then my speech is here
Then thank you very much
Thank you for coming
Then thank you very much
Friends who helped me watch the video
such
Thank you for your speech
Thank you
Is there anyone here who wants to ask questions?
Anyway, everyone can ask directly
You can chat directly
Yes yes yes yes yes
I have a question
Hello
Hi
That you just said
This thing
With your temperature
In the case of climate change
Um
Is it that it won't change?
Wet flow will not change
It's kind of like you're getting warmer
But your wet flow rate is still there
That is, it
The wet flow rate comes from the physics equation
It won't change because of your temperature increase
It's kind of like
Like first derivative
That is, you are dividing
To determine its gradient
That's it
This is my understanding
I don't know
I instinctively think
I don't quite agree with this sentence
because
Our atmosphere
Unless you are an ideal atmosphere
It's dry
Of course it's dry and hot
Yes
Especially in hot areas
There is water
The water will change as the climate changes
Yes
So you are in the atmosphere
The distribution of water will also change in the atmosphere
Yes
I think I think
When there is wet
The thing when it's wet is
It's different
I agree
That is, if there is
The process of water
This thing is completely different
Yes
Yes
It should be said that this is why
This is why
Wet flow is very complicated
So why
Why do I want to simplify this model
To see
If I only look at
Only look at
Only look at the simplified
The buoyancy structure
What will it be
Will
What are the different things
OK
Then I think this sentence should
Your take-home message
The first sentence should be
The dry
Left side
Dry right
It won't change
Yes
It's a major issue
Yes
So it's dry
It won't change
But if it's visual
If it's hot
Yes
It will change
Yes
That's right
No change
Then we can go back to your
Is that the projection of the simplified model just now?
it is good
Come here
Yes
Ah
So your model is
Assuming
In a
In an unstable environment
That's right
Then
Ah
If
In the process of a block rise
As long as it
Fluid
As long as its water reaches
The amount of water that can hold its temperature
Yes
It will be condensed
Yes
When the condensation occurs
Ah
In fact
In fact
It's not that complicated
I'm just thinking
I'm just thinking
This is the 1960s
That
That
You know that very simple
That one
What's the difference in flow parameters?
I
I think
I think it's a bit
I'll just talk about my concept
It's just
It's actually a little bit simpler than you just said
I think
I think it's a little bit simpler than what I just said
Because my
I give my
The upper and lower boundaries are actually in a state of saturation
Then
Ah
Then
There is a condition that I just mentioned
If it is saturated
There is a buoyancy below
This equation
In fact, it is
It is
If it is saturated
It is the visual heat
If it is not saturated, it is the dry heat
The process of dry heat
So it's actually
It's actually not that I
It makes it easier to judge the saturation
It's so simple that there's only one maximum to judge this thing
So
Then
Then what do I want to do?
Then
Because the boundary conditions are fixed over there
It's not like I'm giving it
It's not like the traditional atmospheric mode
I'm giving the temperature to the humidity
The volume to decide
Hey, my atmospheric mode is exactly what I gave
How many
Things are in the mode
In fact, it is
I
It's a bit like I'm giving
I'm giving
Then I give
In fact, I am giving benefits
It was originally written with benefits
This is why I want to do benefits in the first page
It is
Use benefits to drive the whole mode
Then I give the volume of benefits to decide
Hey, it's not stable
And then in the case of instability
How do I distribute things
You've already published this result, haven't you?
Hey
In the province
I got minor revision
So
OK
Maybe I'll have to look for it later
To understand the details
Yeah, I think we can
Hey, will you go to that?
Hurricane Conference
Which one is it?
Hey
May
The beginning of May is the Tropical Meteorology
Okay, let's talk about it then
OK
Thank you
Yeah, this one
This
I think it's
He simplified
Too many things
With
He even
He even
Should be
Just
He is much more simplified than the cloud
such
Is there any problem here?
If not
I can ask
Just on this picture
why
I want to understand
This is Tropical Meteorology
Why are the upper and lower boundaries saturated?
You have to calculate it as saturated
Calculated as saturated
Isn't it raining already?
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Isn't it raining already?
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Is it Rainy here?
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
The floor
Hey
Hey
Hey
It's raining
So it's a bit like
Because it can simplify a little bit of the problem
So let it become a little bit more simplified
Then
Another more practical reason
Is that we found out in the previous research
If the lower boundary is saturated and the upper boundary is not saturated
Its stability is actually relatively stable
It will be stable in the end
Then its simulation is relatively boring
It won't have a stable flow
So why do we set the upper and lower boundaries to be stable
One reason is that it can produce a more interesting result
Then another reason is that it can simplify
It can simplify what we are doing
It can reduce a variable when it is analyzed five times
Sorry
Because I don't understand at all
So what I want to understand is
This is more in line with the actual physical situation
The bottom is the sea
Then the top
The bottom sea is saturated
This I seem to understand
Yes yes yes
Then the top
It's actually not that consistent
To be honest, it's not that consistent
But
But I should say that I can add a little more
The reason it is consistent is
If you look at this cloud
If it goes up to the top
To some extent
If there is a cloud, it is still relatively saturated
So if the upper boundary is saturated
It didn't lose too much
Is related to what we originally assumed
If there is still a cloud on it
It is basically saturated
Of course, in the real atmosphere, it is the top of the stream
Its water volume is relatively difficult
Through the top of the stream to the bottom of the stream
Of course, you should say that in this situation
If there is a lot of water on the top of the stream
There are a lot of clouds like this
In fact, it is not too far from the saturation
So in fact, having a cloud means that it is already close to saturation
It should be said that there is a cloud
In fact, it is called that it is over-saturated
It will produce clouds
The process of the water vapor that I just omitted is
When I reach the saturation condition
In fact, many times
Its water droplets will not freeze
It still needs to freeze
Water will freeze
Drops
Then we have here
In fact, there is an assumption that I did not mention
It is assumed that
Water is produced as soon as it reaches saturation
In fact, this is done
Many people in the micro-physical process
They will not make this assumption
Oh understand
Then I still have one more thing to understand today
I'm sorry, I have a lot of questions
Recently all asked
Because my question should be more obvious
I'll ask him first
The first one is why
Your atmospheric simulation is incompressible fluid
In fact, this is also a very good question
Because in atmospheric
When we just talked about the cloud mode
It actually does not use incompressible
But it will use an elastic
It will make the density vertical
This situation
That is
But it is basically incompressible
If you do
When that compressible analysis
You will find that the compressible amount
In the system
Can
The contribution is very small
So it contributes less than
10-2
So this result is what we do
Because when you do
When you go to do compressible fluid
The price you need is very high
For example, your time step will become very small
Then what you can solve becomes a lot less
So rather than
Spend a long time
To do
Compressible to do that simple calculation
Why don't we take this compressible
We can do a longer time
So a lot of atmospheric
These discussions
Are all using incompressible
Gas?
They have
This is also a good question
When doing incompressible
In fact, there are different levels of incompressible
Some people's incompressible
Is divergent u is equal to 0
Then some people's incompressible
Is
Divergent rho u is equal to 0
Is that it puts density
Vertically distributed
This phenomenon
What is u?
u is
Speed is its three-dimensional speed
Its speed
Has
The density has
This is the second
Relatively complicated
Then there is
There is also
Divergent u is equal to
Its
Incompressibility
Related to the release of heat
This is a little more complicated
Then there is
If you say
Its
Related to heat
This is usually called pseudo-compressible
So it will have different levels of simplification
Of course, the more you consider
The more difficult your numerical model is
Never thought
Gas can use incompressible
To consider
It has a little bit
It should be said that if you really use compressible
You can do a lot of things
Then
In fact, after talking about compressible
It has more simplification
If your model is
Hydrostatic
Accurate
If you do it
Will simplify more
The time you can simulate is longer
But of course it is
You take this advantage
You have to sacrifice something
Then in my question
Its problem is not very good
It is a large area of ​​level
But its vertical movement is very important
So this is why
Choose such a simulation
It will choose
For example, its horizontal grid
Is 1km x 1km
But its vertical may be a few hundred meters
The last one I want to know
Why
Stable
Corresponds to
There is a video in front of you
Adiabatic process
It means it is stable
Do you want to talk about this?
This
Adiabatic
My understanding is thermal
What does it have to do with stable?
Let me think about it
If it is
In fact, we have
Equation
We put hydrostatic plus
Adiabatic process
We deduce the lapse rate
If you have hydrostatic plus
Hydrostatic plus
Add that
Adiabatic
You will get this dry lapse rate
In dry lapse rate
Your block can move up and down
Then it won't
Its movement is the same as the adiabatic process
Is consistent
If your vertical distribution
Is the distribution of the adiabatic process
Then it is up and down
In neutral state
I moved block A to block B
I found that these two blocks are the same
It means it won't
Change position
It won't run away
It means it is relatively neutral
But if you run to stable
In stable case
You exchange blocks
It will return to its original position
It means it is stable
Dry lapse rate is a
Criterion
If you are more than dry lapse rate
It will become more unstable
So
If you are less than dry lapse rate
It is relatively stable
So lapse rate is like
Stress hole
If you are less than this stress hole
It is unstable
It is stable
So you mean
When in a stable case
You just
Take a piece of air from the sky
Its
It will float
It is the same
If it is dry lapse rate
It is the same
You have a profile
If it is dry lapse rate
If you take a normal air
Because it is stable
So you take an air from the sky
You wrap it with a balloon
Because when it comes down
It will compress
It will compress into a smaller air
When you bring it to the ground
Because it passed the cooling process
Its cooling will be more
Because it is stable
The air will float
The air will float
You mean
The condition is
You
You put
15°C
Put it
200
2 km
Its buoyancy is equal to 0
These two things are the same
This can be inferred
Yes
If
Let me think
If you are on the lapse rate
The whole block
Its buoyancy is equal to 0
It will not
It is not very good
It is trying to stabilize
Its buoyancy is equal to the weight of the block
Yes
This is quite interesting
You can look it up
Yes
If
If your institute has a book
You can refer to it
It is called atmospheric thermodynamics
The series of books
My question is finished
Thank you
Is there any professional question here?
No?
I will turn off the recording
Thank you
Thank you
