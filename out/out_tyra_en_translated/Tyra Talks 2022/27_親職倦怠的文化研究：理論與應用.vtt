WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
Recording has started.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.720
Okay, thank you for the introduction, Ya-Hui.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.600
And thank you all for coming to listen to my PhD thesis

00:11.600 --> 00:13.000
or my research,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.440
my research over the past few years.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.840
Yes, I'm Gao Xian, Lin Gao Xian.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.160
And I'm currently at the University of Belize

00:21.160 --> 00:22.520
taking my PhD class.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.840
And the topic I'm going to share with you today

00:24.840 --> 00:27.200
is Occult Research in Parental Burnout,

00:27.200 --> 00:28.880
Theory and Application.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.560
It's a cultural research on parental burnout.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.240
Okay, when I give a speech on this topic,

00:35.240 --> 00:37.360
I usually ask my audience,

00:37.360 --> 00:38.400
we can imagine,

00:38.400 --> 00:41.520
or some of us may already have some youthful experience.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.680
What do you think it would feel like to be a parent?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.200
We'll probably spend some time,

00:48.200 --> 00:49.560
probably a few seconds,

00:49.560 --> 00:50.680
or even a minute,

00:50.680 --> 00:51.640
to think about,

00:51.640 --> 00:52.840
if you were a parent,

00:52.840 --> 00:55.520
what kind of feeling would you usually feel?

00:55.520 --> 00:57.600
Most of the audience,

00:57.600 --> 00:58.720
or most parents,

00:58.720 --> 00:59.320
would probably feel,

00:59.320 --> 01:02.200
like it's shown in this picture,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.600
we would feel that

01:03.600 --> 01:06.760
parenthood is a place full of happiness,

01:06.760 --> 01:08.480
full of excitement,

01:08.480 --> 01:11.000
full of satisfaction.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.600
When we see our kids, we think they're so cute.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.720
We think they're very innocent,

01:14.720 --> 01:17.560
very innocent.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.960
But in the past few years,

01:19.960 --> 01:22.320
when we were in our IQ test,

01:22.320 --> 01:25.680
when we were actually interacting with our parents,

01:25.680 --> 01:27.720
we started to realize that

01:27.720 --> 01:31.240
some parents don't feel

01:31.240 --> 01:34.880
that they have this kind of positive feeling.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.920
Some parents would tell us that

01:36.920 --> 01:38.720
they felt

01:38.720 --> 01:40.880
they were filled with a strong sense of bondage,

01:40.880 --> 01:44.360
as if they were crushed

01:44.360 --> 01:46.440
by the role of being a parent.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.800
They even told us that

01:47.800 --> 01:50.360
they felt they couldn't do anything for their kids.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.360
They could only do what they had to do.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.160
They couldn't do anything else.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.800
Some parents even felt

01:55.800 --> 01:57.520
that they couldn't bear

01:57.520 --> 01:59.480
the role of being a parent anymore.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.800
Some parents even told us that

02:01.800 --> 02:03.840
they felt they were no longer

02:03.840 --> 02:07.560
the good parents they used to be.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.600
In fact, this kind of testimony

02:09.600 --> 02:12.560
or this kind of report

02:12.560 --> 02:13.440
is too diverse.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.800
We hear too often

02:14.800 --> 02:18.880
that our parents report this kind of experience.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.160
As researchers,

02:20.160 --> 02:21.520
we really want to understand

02:21.520 --> 02:23.800
why they have this kind of feeling.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.600
So we started to try to define

02:28.600 --> 02:30.600
what kind of phenomenon this is.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.400
So, over the past few years,

02:32.400 --> 02:39.520
our team has defined a new feeling

02:39.520 --> 02:41.680
or a new symptom.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.440
We call it a parental burnout

02:43.440 --> 02:46.560
or a new concept of parental burnout.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.160
This concept includes

02:48.160 --> 02:51.040
the various symptoms

02:51.040 --> 02:53.040
we just talked about,

02:53.040 --> 02:55.560
including the feeling of

02:55.560 --> 02:57.280
being in a parental role

02:57.280 --> 02:59.840
or a sense of distance

02:59.840 --> 03:01.120
between you and your kids.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.920
It's an emotional distancing.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.200
So, you can only do

03:05.200 --> 03:06.240
what you have to do for them

03:06.240 --> 03:08.560
and you can't do anything

03:08.560 --> 03:13.360
for them emotionally.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.800
You may even feel

03:14.800 --> 03:17.240
that you are burdened

03:17.240 --> 03:21.040
with the sense of responsibility

03:21.040 --> 03:22.360
of being a parent.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.600
Or you may even feel

03:23.600 --> 03:25.200
that you have a different feeling

03:25.200 --> 03:26.720
from the past.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.160
It's a contrasting experience.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.280
We know that

03:32.280 --> 03:34.400
if there is a parental burnout,

03:34.400 --> 03:36.000
if parental burnout

03:36.000 --> 03:38.200
really exists

03:38.200 --> 03:39.880
as our researchers say,

03:39.880 --> 03:41.880
we may be curious

03:41.880 --> 03:44.280
about the importance

03:44.280 --> 03:45.640
of parental burnout.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.560
Why do we need to care about it?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.680
I can tell you

03:48.680 --> 03:49.760
that in our past research,

03:49.760 --> 03:50.960
we found that

03:50.960 --> 03:52.480
parental burnout

03:52.480 --> 03:55.080
has a serious impact

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
on our parents

03:56.080 --> 03:57.000
and our kids.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.680
It affects their mental and physical health.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.840
For example,

03:59.840 --> 04:00.800
we found that

04:00.800 --> 04:02.640
parental burnout

04:02.640 --> 04:05.200
strongly affects our parents.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.120
Especially the parents

04:07.120 --> 04:08.840
with parental burnout.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.560
They are more likely

04:10.560 --> 04:11.800
to want to escape

04:11.800 --> 04:13.160
their current life

04:13.160 --> 04:16.520
and their family life.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.960
This kind of ideation

04:18.960 --> 04:20.720
has a strong effect

04:20.720 --> 04:23.960
on their suicide.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.520
It's a very important

04:25.520 --> 04:27.080
cause of mental and physical health.

04:27.080 --> 04:27.960
On the other hand,

04:27.960 --> 04:30.680
we often see that

04:30.680 --> 04:34.120
parents with parental burnout

04:34.120 --> 04:35.840
tend to be violent

04:35.840 --> 04:38.200
to their kids

04:38.200 --> 04:40.080
or ignore the needs

04:40.080 --> 04:41.320
of their kids

04:42.760 --> 04:44.800
and misbehave.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.760
It's not surprising

04:46.760 --> 04:48.080
that if our parents

04:48.080 --> 04:49.880
have parental burnout,

04:49.880 --> 04:52.360
their kids often have

04:52.360 --> 04:53.400
depression

04:53.400 --> 04:54.640
or anxiety

04:54.640 --> 04:58.400
in their mental and physical health.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.880
This is a very important issue.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.360
As we mentioned,

05:01.360 --> 05:02.880
it may affect

05:02.880 --> 05:03.760
our parents

05:03.760 --> 05:05.160
or our next generation's

05:05.160 --> 05:06.560
mental and physical health.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.320
On the other hand,

05:07.320 --> 05:08.720
we wonder

05:08.720 --> 05:09.840
who

05:09.840 --> 05:11.840
has parental burnout

05:11.840 --> 05:14.440
or this kind of feeling.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.800
In our past research,

05:16.840 --> 05:18.600
we collected

05:18.600 --> 05:20.120
the data of parents in different countries.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.720
We tried to estimate

05:21.720 --> 05:23.720
which country

05:23.720 --> 05:25.960
or which country's parents

05:25.960 --> 05:26.800
are more likely

05:26.800 --> 05:28.640
to have parental burnout.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.600
We found something

05:29.600 --> 05:30.520
very important.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.560
We found that

05:31.560 --> 05:33.240
in different parts of the world,

05:33.240 --> 05:35.200
the prevalence rate

05:35.200 --> 05:36.680
of parental burnout

05:36.680 --> 05:38.800
is very different.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.720
Especially in Western countries,

05:40.720 --> 05:42.240
their parental burnout

05:42.240 --> 05:43.760
is more likely

05:43.760 --> 05:45.520
to happen

05:45.520 --> 05:46.960
in Western countries.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.280
Or they may have

05:48.280 --> 05:51.200
parental burnout.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.040
To be more specific,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.520
this ratio

05:55.520 --> 05:57.560
is even more than five times.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.000
For example,

05:58.000 --> 05:59.200
the picture on the left

05:59.200 --> 06:01.520
is the prevalence rate

06:01.520 --> 06:03.360
of parental burnout

06:03.360 --> 06:04.480
we have estimated.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.600
I don't know if you can see

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
my mouse.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
Basically,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.000
in this picture,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.440
the darker the color,

06:10.440 --> 06:12.480
it means

06:12.480 --> 06:13.560
the more likely

06:14.000 --> 06:16.040
the parental burnout is.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.760
We can see that

06:16.760 --> 06:18.240
in North America

06:18.240 --> 06:20.160
or in European countries,

06:20.160 --> 06:21.360
even in Russia,

06:21.360 --> 06:23.000
the prevalence rate

06:23.000 --> 06:23.920
of parental burnout is the highest.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.400
Compared to non-Western countries,

06:25.400 --> 06:26.880
the prevalence rate

06:26.880 --> 06:27.960
of parental burnout

06:27.960 --> 06:30.640
is basically lower.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.960
In fact, the highest

06:31.960 --> 06:34.880
may even be up to 8%.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.480
Parents may be

06:36.480 --> 06:38.200
suffering

06:38.200 --> 06:41.280
from parental burnout

06:41.320 --> 06:44.640
or mental illness.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.760
Next,

06:45.760 --> 06:48.400
we may want to

06:48.400 --> 06:50.680
ask

06:50.680 --> 06:52.120
why

06:52.120 --> 06:54.720
parents in Western countries

06:54.720 --> 06:56.680
or their parents

06:56.680 --> 06:58.320
may suffer from parental burnout

06:58.320 --> 07:00.280
so easily.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.320
Are there any shared reasons

07:03.320 --> 07:06.840
in these regions

07:06.840 --> 07:08.160
that can help us understand

07:08.160 --> 07:09.640
why they may suffer

07:09.680 --> 07:11.280
from parental burnout?

07:11.280 --> 07:14.920
To answer this question,

07:14.920 --> 07:16.360
we conducted

07:16.360 --> 07:18.240
a series of research.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.760
We did a cultural research

07:19.760 --> 07:20.400
to find out

07:20.400 --> 07:22.760
what cultural factors

07:22.760 --> 07:25.880
are shared by parents in Western countries

07:25.880 --> 07:26.680
to make them

07:26.680 --> 07:29.280
more likely to suffer from parental burnout.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.880
Before we start

07:31.880 --> 07:33.640
our research,

07:33.640 --> 07:36.600
we may be curious about

07:36.600 --> 07:37.560
what a cultural research

07:37.560 --> 07:38.960
should do.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.840
Obviously,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.520
culture includes many concepts.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.120
It includes ideas,

07:43.120 --> 07:44.680
beliefs,

07:44.680 --> 07:46.840
behaviors,

07:46.840 --> 07:48.520
and traditions.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.120
These things

07:49.120 --> 07:51.720
are all part of our culture.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.120
How can we

07:53.120 --> 07:55.080
conduct a research

07:55.080 --> 07:56.720
on such a complex issue?

07:56.720 --> 07:58.600
Fortunately,

07:58.600 --> 08:01.360
some research has shown us

08:01.360 --> 08:02.840
that different cultures

08:02.840 --> 08:05.160
have certain ways

08:05.160 --> 08:08.040
to distinguish different cultural characteristics.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.840
We call this

08:11.840 --> 08:14.600
a pre-existing

08:14.600 --> 08:16.120
theoretical framework.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.800
As researchers,

08:17.800 --> 08:18.720
if we are curious

08:18.720 --> 08:19.840
about the cultural factors

08:19.840 --> 08:21.000
that can explain

08:21.000 --> 08:22.240
why parents

08:22.240 --> 08:24.600
suffer from parental burnout,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.080
we may be able to

08:26.080 --> 08:27.720
use the theory structure

08:27.720 --> 08:30.720
of cultural differences

08:30.720 --> 08:31.880
in the past

08:31.880 --> 08:33.760
to explain

08:33.760 --> 08:37.560
whether these cultural factors

08:37.560 --> 08:38.680
can predict

08:38.680 --> 08:39.640
parental burnout.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.640
This is a very intuitive

08:40.640 --> 08:42.800
and simple research.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.760
On the other hand,

08:43.760 --> 08:45.280
we can imagine

08:45.280 --> 08:46.120
that parental burnout

08:46.120 --> 08:51.040
is a very specific phenomenon.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.240
It occurs in

08:53.240 --> 08:55.000
our parental environment.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.240
We may doubt

08:57.240 --> 08:58.440
that if we use

08:58.440 --> 09:01.280
the general theoretical framework

09:01.280 --> 09:02.160
to explain

09:02.160 --> 09:03.680
parental burnout,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.160
we may ignore

09:05.160 --> 09:06.520
the important

09:06.520 --> 09:08.680
cultural concept of parental burnout.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.240
It may be that

09:10.240 --> 09:10.840
we can predict

09:10.840 --> 09:11.520
that parental burnout

09:11.520 --> 09:12.640
is a very important concept

09:12.640 --> 09:13.920
and we ignore it.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
In order to make up

09:14.920 --> 09:16.200
for this phenomenon,

09:16.200 --> 09:16.960
in addition to using

09:16.960 --> 09:18.360
a very simple

09:18.360 --> 09:19.880
or straightforward

09:19.880 --> 09:22.160
research trend like TopDown,

09:22.160 --> 09:23.120
the bottom-up approach

09:23.120 --> 09:24.560
is that we don't hold

09:24.560 --> 09:25.840
any research assumptions.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.400
We directly ask a research question

09:28.400 --> 09:29.440
and collect data.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.720
We directly

09:30.720 --> 09:32.280
let our theoretical framework

09:32.280 --> 09:34.280
appear in our data.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.720
This research method

09:35.720 --> 09:36.520
is very important.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.640
We have to use this method

09:37.640 --> 09:38.960
to explore

09:38.960 --> 09:41.200
what kind of phenomenon

09:41.200 --> 09:42.720
can help us understand

09:42.720 --> 09:45.000
the cross-cultural difference

09:45.000 --> 09:46.960
of parental burnout.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.520
So, based on this point of view,

09:48.520 --> 09:49.520
we basically use

09:49.520 --> 09:51.920
these two sets of different

09:51.920 --> 09:54.160
research trends.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.000
We designed

09:56.000 --> 09:57.520
six series of research.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.560
In the first part,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.960
we want to explore

10:00.960 --> 10:03.000
the research question just mentioned.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.120
Why is it that

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
the parents

10:05.120 --> 10:06.360
with what kind of

10:06.360 --> 10:07.560
shared causes

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
are more likely to

10:08.560 --> 10:09.400
be affected by

10:09.400 --> 10:10.840
parental burnout?

10:10.840 --> 10:12.240
In addition to using

10:12.240 --> 10:13.640
the TopDown Research Approach

10:13.640 --> 10:15.720
to find these cultural causes,

10:15.720 --> 10:17.160
we also want to understand

10:17.160 --> 10:18.720
why these cultural causes

10:18.720 --> 10:21.000
and these seemingly far-reaching concepts

10:21.000 --> 10:22.880
can be connected

10:22.880 --> 10:25.280
to the bottom-up approach

10:25.280 --> 10:26.240
of parental burnout.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.280
We want to explore

10:27.280 --> 10:29.200
the mechanism

10:29.200 --> 10:31.400
in the system.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.720
We also use

10:32.720 --> 10:33.640
the bottom-up approach

10:33.640 --> 10:35.560
to find other cultural causes

10:35.560 --> 10:38.120
and other possible explanations

10:38.120 --> 10:39.480
as to why these cultural causes

10:39.480 --> 10:40.120
can predict

10:40.120 --> 10:41.680
the theoretical mechanism

10:41.680 --> 10:42.800
of parental burnout.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.720
We researchers

10:44.720 --> 10:46.840
don't just want to

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
confine ourselves

10:48.840 --> 10:50.360
in an academic ivory tower.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.920
We also hope to provide

10:52.920 --> 10:55.320
a theoretical framework

10:55.320 --> 10:56.000
for our research

10:56.000 --> 10:57.560
and the phenomena we create.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
We also hope that

10:58.560 --> 11:00.960
if it can help

11:00.960 --> 11:01.880
our parents

11:01.880 --> 11:04.520
when they are

11:04.520 --> 11:06.360
at work,

11:06.360 --> 11:08.400
or when they are

11:08.400 --> 11:09.200
interacting with their parents,

11:09.200 --> 11:11.240
we can help them.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.640
So, for our theoretical framework,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.080
we also try to

11:15.080 --> 11:16.760
come up with a practical framework.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.200
We try to find

11:18.200 --> 11:20.480
if my theoretical framework

11:20.480 --> 11:22.280
can help us find

11:22.280 --> 11:23.920
some protective factors

11:23.920 --> 11:25.680
that can protect our parents.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.200
Okay.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.320
Let's start

11:28.320 --> 11:30.080
with my first series of research.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.640
We use the top-down approach

11:32.640 --> 11:34.000
to understand

11:34.000 --> 11:36.440
the cultural differences

11:36.440 --> 11:37.800
in parental burnout.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.240
As I mentioned,

11:39.240 --> 11:40.440
culture includes

11:40.440 --> 11:42.840
many different concepts.

11:42.840 --> 11:43.800
It includes ideas,

11:43.800 --> 11:44.600
beliefs,

11:44.600 --> 11:45.400
values,

11:45.400 --> 11:46.840
and many other concepts.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.560
Fortunately,

11:48.560 --> 11:50.880
there are some

11:50.880 --> 11:51.920
well-known

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
and robust

11:53.920 --> 11:54.720
theoretical frameworks

11:54.720 --> 11:56.600
that can help us

11:56.600 --> 11:58.240
understand

11:58.360 --> 12:00.320
the cultural differences

12:00.320 --> 12:02.160
in different countries.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.920
One of the most well-known

12:03.920 --> 12:06.400
is Hofstede's Six Cultural Concepts.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.280
It includes

12:08.280 --> 12:09.560
the six factors.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.320
Among the six factors,

12:11.320 --> 12:12.720
we see

12:12.720 --> 12:14.000
that individualism

12:14.000 --> 12:15.080
or collativism

12:15.080 --> 12:16.800
is a cultural concept.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.920
It refers to

12:19.920 --> 12:20.880
if a country

12:20.880 --> 12:21.760
pays special attention to

12:21.760 --> 12:22.720
individualism,

12:22.720 --> 12:24.680
a cultural concept,

12:24.680 --> 12:27.880
it will rely on

12:27.880 --> 12:29.600
people who are close to it

12:29.600 --> 12:31.040
rather than

12:31.040 --> 12:33.160
other people.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.760
It is a cultural value

12:35.760 --> 12:37.560
that is prevalent in Western countries.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.680
We can imagine

12:42.680 --> 12:44.360
that

12:44.360 --> 12:45.720
based on such a cultural structure,

12:45.720 --> 12:47.840
we can imagine

12:47.840 --> 12:50.360
that if Western countries

12:50.360 --> 12:52.240
are prone to parental burnout,

12:52.240 --> 12:54.160
will the

12:54.160 --> 12:55.120
cultural value

12:55.400 --> 12:58.360
that is prevalent in Western countries

12:58.360 --> 12:59.760
explain

12:59.760 --> 13:02.200
the cultural differences

13:02.200 --> 13:04.520
in parental burnout?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.520
In order to validate

13:06.520 --> 13:08.080
our assumptions,

13:08.080 --> 13:09.440
we collected

13:09.440 --> 13:11.280
more than 10,000 parental data

13:11.280 --> 13:13.280
across 42 countries.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.800
We tried to explain

13:14.800 --> 13:15.320
and answer

13:15.320 --> 13:18.200
our research assumptions.

13:18.200 --> 13:18.960
We basically

13:18.960 --> 13:20.840
did a feedback analysis.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.080
We can see

13:22.080 --> 13:23.600
that when we control

13:23.600 --> 13:27.640
various social demographic factors,

13:27.640 --> 13:30.000
that is,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.040
after the population changes,

13:34.040 --> 13:34.920
we can see that

13:34.920 --> 13:38.080
among the six cultural values,

13:38.080 --> 13:40.400
only individualism

13:40.400 --> 13:41.520
is particularly prevalent

13:41.520 --> 13:43.680
in Western countries.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.920
The cultural value

13:44.920 --> 13:46.200
can predict

13:46.200 --> 13:47.960
the prevalence of parental burnout

13:47.960 --> 13:50.600
and its severity.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.400
However,

13:51.400 --> 13:52.240
we also talked about

13:52.240 --> 13:54.400
the fact that

13:54.400 --> 13:55.920
culture

13:55.920 --> 13:58.240
has different aspects.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.120
Individualism

14:00.120 --> 14:02.120
is simply a Western value.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.320
It also has

14:03.320 --> 14:04.120
different aspects.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.120
Some people

14:07.120 --> 14:08.240
focus on themselves

14:08.240 --> 14:10.520
because they want to improve themselves

14:10.520 --> 14:13.680
and make better progress.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.240
But why do some people

14:16.240 --> 14:18.560
believe in individualism?

14:18.560 --> 14:20.120
Maybe it's because

14:20.120 --> 14:23.800
they don't believe in others

14:23.800 --> 14:25.600
and don't care about others.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.440
So we can imagine

14:26.440 --> 14:27.960
that even if individualism

14:27.960 --> 14:30.560
is a very

14:30.560 --> 14:33.320
macro

14:33.320 --> 14:35.960
or abstract concept,

14:35.960 --> 14:37.640
it actually has different aspects

14:37.640 --> 14:40.040
to explain

14:40.040 --> 14:41.360
the cultural value.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.800
So we have to use

14:42.800 --> 14:45.880
a more detailed cultural structure

14:45.880 --> 14:46.720
to explain

14:46.720 --> 14:48.560
what aspects

14:49.320 --> 14:51.520
of individualism

14:51.520 --> 14:52.240
can explain

14:52.240 --> 14:53.560
the cultural value.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.240
So we try to use

14:55.240 --> 14:57.760
a different model.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.080
In this model,

14:59.080 --> 15:00.720
we can see that

15:00.720 --> 15:02.760
individualism,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.080
which is a country

15:05.080 --> 15:06.640
that emphasizes individualism,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.160
individual individuals,

15:08.160 --> 15:10.840
may have

15:10.840 --> 15:13.560
different aspects.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.640
For example,

15:14.640 --> 15:16.080
they may want to

15:16.080 --> 15:17.680
cultivate themselves

15:17.680 --> 15:19.680
or they may

15:19.680 --> 15:22.120
want to enjoy themselves more.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.840
They may not care about others

15:24.840 --> 15:25.920
or

15:25.920 --> 15:27.360
they may not

15:27.360 --> 15:28.000
do anything

15:28.000 --> 15:29.520
that benefits others.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.040
Or they may not

15:32.040 --> 15:35.200
follow their traditions

15:35.200 --> 15:37.400
or others.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.440
We use

15:39.440 --> 15:40.960
a more detailed

15:40.960 --> 15:42.640
theoretical structure

15:42.640 --> 15:43.880
to see

15:43.880 --> 15:45.320
which aspect

15:45.320 --> 15:46.800
of individualism

15:46.840 --> 15:48.920
can explain

15:48.920 --> 15:51.560
the cultural value.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.800
In order to explain this,

15:52.800 --> 15:53.640
in order to answer

15:53.640 --> 15:55.880
our research questions,

15:55.880 --> 15:56.800
we gathered

15:56.800 --> 15:59.360
more than 600 parents in Poland.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.800
We tried to use

16:00.800 --> 16:02.560
the same research method

16:02.560 --> 16:04.360
to run a return analysis.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
We can see that

16:05.360 --> 16:06.200
basically,

16:06.200 --> 16:08.320
after we control

16:10.440 --> 16:12.320
all the population changes,

16:12.600 --> 16:17.320
in all the 10 cultural values,

16:17.320 --> 16:21.360
only individualism

16:21.360 --> 16:23.520
emphasizes personal achievement

16:23.520 --> 16:27.240
and personal ownership

16:27.240 --> 16:28.800
and power.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.040
It doesn't want to

16:31.040 --> 16:34.520
do anything that benefits others.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.480
It can explain

16:35.480 --> 16:37.840
more of our family values.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.800
At this time,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.760
we can think about

16:41.840 --> 16:43.320
how to use

16:43.320 --> 16:45.240
a more detailed theoretical structure.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.640
We can see that

16:46.640 --> 16:50.120
in this abstract cultural value,

16:50.120 --> 16:53.200
in this cultural value of individualism,

16:53.200 --> 16:54.600
some more detailed aspects,

16:54.600 --> 16:56.000
achievement, power,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.240
and less cultural value

16:57.240 --> 16:59.520
that benefits others,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.560
it can predict our family values.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.960
Now, we can think about

17:02.960 --> 17:05.240
what kind of people

17:05.240 --> 17:05.960
will show

17:05.960 --> 17:08.480
this value trend.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.480
Now,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.480
you can think about

17:11.480 --> 17:13.280
what kind of people

17:13.280 --> 17:16.840
will have this value trend.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.480
In fact, in past research,

17:18.480 --> 17:20.120
it has been told to us

17:20.120 --> 17:21.480
that

17:22.080 --> 17:25.160
those who need to be perfect

17:25.160 --> 17:28.680
and focus on making mistakes

17:28.680 --> 17:31.240
are the perfect individuals.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.200
It's easy for them to show

17:33.200 --> 17:35.280
that they enjoy achievement,

17:35.280 --> 17:37.440
power,

17:37.440 --> 17:39.960
and less perfection

17:40.000 --> 17:42.480
and become perfect individuals.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.720
It's easy for them to show

17:44.720 --> 17:47.200
this kind of value trend.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.520
So, we can imagine

17:49.520 --> 17:50.840
from the research just now,

17:50.840 --> 17:52.680
we can see that

17:52.680 --> 17:56.120
in different aspects of individualism,

17:56.120 --> 17:57.800
perfectionism may be

17:57.800 --> 18:00.080
a very important factor

18:00.080 --> 18:02.360
to predict our family values.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.360
We can also infer that

18:04.360 --> 18:07.000
perhaps in the family environment,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.800
the parents who emphasize perfectionism

18:09.800 --> 18:13.520
are particularly likely to be affected by family ties.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.640
But we may be curious

18:15.640 --> 18:16.720
that the emphasis on perfectionism

18:16.720 --> 18:19.360
in the family environment

18:19.360 --> 18:20.800
is actually similar to

18:20.800 --> 18:23.560
our personality.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.280
It's a feeling

18:25.280 --> 18:26.240
that we may feel

18:26.240 --> 18:27.320
in the family

18:27.320 --> 18:30.000
with our family ties.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.320
These two concepts

18:32.320 --> 18:34.080
are very different.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.120
Why are they connected?

18:36.120 --> 18:38.400
So, we can think about

18:38.680 --> 18:41.360
the mechanism

18:41.360 --> 18:42.320
of perfectionism.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.240
We want to know

18:43.240 --> 18:45.920
what kind of internal mechanism

18:45.920 --> 18:49.680
can explain these two very different concepts.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.160
So, let's think again.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.440
In our family environment

18:55.440 --> 18:58.440
or in the environment where we raise children,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.000
what kind of situation is it?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.200
It's actually a very dynamic

19:03.200 --> 19:04.840
and chaotic situation.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.880
Sometimes, children may cry.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.760
But when they cry,

19:07.760 --> 19:09.600
there is no special reason.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.440
At this time, if our parents

19:11.440 --> 19:12.480
may naturally

19:12.480 --> 19:14.520
express their negative emotions,

19:14.520 --> 19:15.600
we can imagine

19:15.600 --> 19:18.720
that the dynamic environment of this family

19:18.720 --> 19:21.520
will gradually become a vicious cycle.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.560
There will be more and more negative emotions in it.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.880
At this time, if we want to solve

19:27.880 --> 19:29.440
such a negative cycle quickly,

19:29.440 --> 19:32.040
we may have to adopt

19:32.040 --> 19:34.360
some highly efficient

19:35.760 --> 19:37.280
emotional adjustment strategies.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.040
Our parents may adopt

19:39.040 --> 19:41.520
such an emotional control.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.560
They must control their negative emotions

19:44.560 --> 19:47.120
and not show it to their children.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.920
This kind of emotional adjustment.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.320
We can also imagine that

19:51.320 --> 19:52.720
especially those parents

19:52.720 --> 19:55.800
who particularly emphasize that they need to be perfect,

19:55.800 --> 19:57.720
they will particularly want to adopt

19:57.720 --> 20:00.800
such an emotional adjustment

20:00.800 --> 20:02.560
to control each other's emotions.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.040
So, we can assume

20:04.040 --> 20:06.880
why our parenting professionalism

20:07.320 --> 20:09.120
emphasizes perfectionism

20:09.120 --> 20:11.680
in the family environment.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.360
It is related to parenting.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.120
Maybe it's because such a characteristic

20:16.120 --> 20:18.800
will make it easier for our parents

20:21.120 --> 20:22.880
to control their emotions

20:22.880 --> 20:25.480
and not show it to their children.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.680
This kind of suppression

20:26.680 --> 20:27.960
or expressive suppression

20:27.960 --> 20:30.280
is an emotional adjustment strategy.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.560
In order to solve this problem,

20:31.560 --> 20:32.360
in order to respond to

20:32.360 --> 20:34.160
such a research hypothesis,

20:34.160 --> 20:36.280
we have collected

20:36.280 --> 20:40.000
more than 400 parents in Poland.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.440
We can see that

20:41.440 --> 20:44.040
the more our parents emphasize

20:44.040 --> 20:48.520
that they want to be perfect,

20:48.520 --> 20:50.000
the easier it will be for them

20:50.000 --> 20:52.440
to adopt such an emotional adjustment strategy

20:52.440 --> 20:54.160
to further affect

20:54.160 --> 20:56.440
their children.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.400
So, in conclusion,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.520
we can see that

21:03.520 --> 21:05.440
using the top-down research approach,

21:05.440 --> 21:08.480
using the existing cultural structure,

21:08.480 --> 21:09.920
we can see that

21:09.920 --> 21:10.560
in the West,

21:10.560 --> 21:11.720
Western parents

21:11.720 --> 21:13.040
are particularly prone to

21:13.040 --> 21:14.120
the influence of parental suppression.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.280
This is especially related to their personalism.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.880
More specifically,

21:18.880 --> 21:21.720
it is related to their perfectionism.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.800
So, why is such a cultural value

21:23.800 --> 21:26.120
related to parental suppression?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.760
Maybe it's because

21:28.760 --> 21:29.960
such a cultural value

21:29.960 --> 21:35.720
allows them to use more emotional control

21:35.720 --> 21:37.640
and more suppression.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.640
That's why

21:39.640 --> 21:41.760
such a personalist effect is produced.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.280
As I mentioned at the beginning,

21:45.280 --> 21:46.800
in fact, culture

21:46.800 --> 21:48.320
includes different levels.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.920
We should not only use

21:50.920 --> 21:52.760
the top-down research approach.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.600
We should also use

21:54.600 --> 21:58.800
the approach that is closer to the parents' environment.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.000
We should visit our parents.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.680
We should keep a fixed research question.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.440
We should collect our data

22:05.440 --> 22:07.520
and not make any research assumptions.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.560
We should directly see

22:08.560 --> 22:11.720
if there are any neglected changes

22:11.720 --> 22:13.680
that can actually help us understand

22:13.680 --> 22:16.240
the cultural difference of parental suppression.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.160
So, with this in mind,

22:19.160 --> 22:21.080
we also carried out our third research,

22:21.080 --> 22:22.920
a bottom-up research approach.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.400
We try to take such a research strategy

22:25.400 --> 22:27.520
to see if there are any differences

22:27.520 --> 22:28.920
in parental culture

22:28.920 --> 22:31.360
or if there are any cultural factors

22:31.360 --> 22:33.440
that are particularly prevalent in the West

22:33.440 --> 22:36.480
that can explain parental parental suppression.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.200
Okay.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.840
In order to answer this question,

22:40.840 --> 22:42.000
as we just said,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.400
we have to immediately

22:45.040 --> 22:48.280
raise a research question

22:48.280 --> 22:49.680
and collect the data

22:49.680 --> 22:51.880
without making any research assumptions.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.920
So, the question we raise here

22:53.920 --> 22:55.240
might be,

22:55.240 --> 22:58.680
what is the culture of parenting in Western countries?

22:58.680 --> 23:00.680
What characteristics

23:00.680 --> 23:05.320
can describe Western parenting culture?

23:05.320 --> 23:06.680
To answer this question,

23:06.680 --> 23:08.560
we might be able to directly think about

23:08.560 --> 23:10.920
what kind of parenting culture

23:10.920 --> 23:13.920
and how to collect such data.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.040
We can imagine that

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
in fact, in different parenting cultures,

23:17.040 --> 23:20.440
there will be a very specific model performance.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.520
We can imagine that some parents

23:22.520 --> 23:24.680
may fantasize that

23:25.040 --> 23:27.120
what kind of good parents

23:27.120 --> 23:31.160
they imagine in their mind.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.240
The good parents in their mind

23:33.240 --> 23:35.120
may be able to show

23:35.120 --> 23:39.280
the characteristics of different parenting cultures.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.800
So, we directly ask the parents.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
We directly visit

23:44.800 --> 23:49.080
the thousands of mothers and fathers

23:49.080 --> 23:51.000
across 37 different countries.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.440
We ask them,

23:52.440 --> 23:53.720
in your mind,

23:53.720 --> 23:56.480
if you can only use five characteristics

23:56.480 --> 23:59.480
to describe the good...

23:59.480 --> 24:04.280
model father and model mother in your mind,

24:04.280 --> 24:07.800
how would you describe their characteristics?

24:07.800 --> 24:10.320
I will pause for about a minute.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.400
Although there are only five of us,

24:12.400 --> 24:13.800
we can imagine that

24:13.800 --> 24:16.600
if you are a parent,

24:16.600 --> 24:17.520
you are already a parent,

24:17.520 --> 24:19.400
or you are not a parent yet,

24:19.400 --> 24:20.760
you can imagine

24:20.800 --> 24:24.200
that if we want to describe a model parent,

24:24.200 --> 24:26.440
you only use five characteristics to describe them,

24:26.440 --> 24:28.440
how would you describe them?

24:28.440 --> 24:30.120
Yes, I will pause for a minute.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.880
If you have any questions at this time,

24:31.880 --> 24:32.880
you can also ask.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.720
Okay.

24:50.440 --> 24:51.280
Okay.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.200
You may already have some ideas in your mind.

24:54.200 --> 24:59.200
I will tell you what we saw in our research.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.000
We found that

25:01.000 --> 25:02.600
in Western countries,

25:02.600 --> 25:05.480
they do have a very special pattern.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.080
Their good parents...

25:08.080 --> 25:09.640
They do have a fixed idea

25:09.640 --> 25:13.000
about good parents.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.280
We did find that,

25:14.280 --> 25:17.000
especially in some Western countries

25:17.000 --> 25:18.080
that speak English,

25:18.080 --> 25:19.720
including the United States,

25:19.720 --> 25:20.560
Canada,

25:21.760 --> 25:23.000
Australia,

25:23.000 --> 25:23.840
the UK,

25:23.840 --> 25:25.000
and European countries,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.880
and even Russia,

25:26.880 --> 25:28.680
and some countries that speak French,

25:28.680 --> 25:30.520
they particularly emphasize

25:30.520 --> 25:33.080
that when they describe those model parents,

25:33.080 --> 25:35.400
they emphasize

25:35.400 --> 25:37.200
that they need to show love,

25:37.200 --> 25:39.720
that they need to show patience,

25:39.720 --> 25:42.080
that they need to pay attention,

25:42.080 --> 25:44.200
that they need to listen to their children.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.440
These are different characteristics.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.840
What do these characteristics show?

25:48.840 --> 25:50.080
They show that

25:50.080 --> 25:53.480
in these different Western cultures,

25:53.480 --> 25:55.920
what they emphasize is

25:55.920 --> 25:57.600
to show positive emotions

25:57.600 --> 25:59.480
and to control negative emotions.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.760
This is a characteristic.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.880
In the past, research has shown

26:03.880 --> 26:07.000
that this type of education

26:07.000 --> 26:11.200
is actually a so-called positive education.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.320
Positive education refers to

26:14.320 --> 26:15.640
showing positive emotions

26:15.640 --> 26:18.520
and controlling negative emotions.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.160
So, from this research,

26:20.160 --> 26:21.320
we can see that

26:24.920 --> 26:26.880
using this pattern approach,

26:26.880 --> 26:29.000
we can see that Western education

26:29.000 --> 26:32.360
emphasizes emotional performance.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.840
This emotional performance

26:33.840 --> 26:35.160
is to show positive emotions

26:35.160 --> 26:37.040
and control negative emotions.

26:37.040 --> 26:37.800
At this time,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.480
we may want to ask a question.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.360
Why does such a

26:42.360 --> 26:44.760
seemingly beautiful thing

26:44.760 --> 26:46.120
show positive emotions

26:46.120 --> 26:47.080
and control negative emotions?

26:47.080 --> 26:48.520
This kind of education strategy

26:48.520 --> 26:51.160
may be related to

26:51.160 --> 26:52.880
the parent-child relationship.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.400
So, after our research,

26:55.400 --> 26:57.360
we further asked

26:57.360 --> 27:01.320
if there is a mechanism

27:01.320 --> 27:03.400
to explain this.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.560
We can imagine that

27:05.560 --> 27:07.080
positive parenting

27:07.080 --> 27:09.320
or showing positive emotions

27:09.320 --> 27:10.400
and controlling negative emotions

27:10.400 --> 27:13.440
is a form of emotional performance.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.840
When our parents

27:14.840 --> 27:18.120
have this model image of their parents,

27:18.120 --> 27:20.120
what do they need to do?

27:20.120 --> 27:21.680
Basically,

27:21.680 --> 27:22.560
they feel that

27:22.560 --> 27:25.720
in the process of raising children,

27:25.760 --> 27:28.280
they need to control themselves

27:28.280 --> 27:32.120
and achieve this emotional performance strategy.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.600
They need to tell themselves

27:34.600 --> 27:36.440
that they need to show positive emotions

27:36.440 --> 27:38.640
and control negative emotions.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.600
To a certain extent,

27:39.600 --> 27:41.840
it is an emotional performance strategy.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.800
When an emotional performance strategy occurs,

27:43.800 --> 27:46.560
when there is such an emotional performance strategy,

27:46.560 --> 27:50.160
our parents may have to act.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.760
When they are not happy,

27:53.760 --> 27:56.360
when they have a lot of negative emotions,

27:56.360 --> 27:58.200
they have to try to

27:58.200 --> 28:00.000
put a smile on their face

28:00.000 --> 28:03.360
in front of their children.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.560
They have to make their appearance

28:06.560 --> 28:09.760
in line with this emotional performance strategy.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.360
On the other hand,

28:10.360 --> 28:11.760
some parents may

28:11.760 --> 28:13.560
try to use different methods

28:13.560 --> 28:14.600
to make themselves

28:14.600 --> 28:16.560
look unhappy

28:16.560 --> 28:19.120
from the moment

28:19.120 --> 28:22.480
to find some happy feelings.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.960
Whether it is

28:23.960 --> 28:25.760
simply controlling your appearance

28:25.760 --> 28:28.680
or simply changing

28:28.680 --> 28:30.400
your inner feelings,

28:30.400 --> 28:31.760
these different emotions

28:31.760 --> 28:33.240
are actually a kind of acting

28:33.240 --> 28:34.560
to a certain extent.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.920
They are all trying to

28:35.920 --> 28:37.360
show and perform

28:37.360 --> 28:38.840
a positive education strategy

28:38.840 --> 28:41.280
in front of our children.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.640
We can also easily imagine

28:43.640 --> 28:48.360
that this set of emotional labor

28:48.360 --> 28:50.960
or emotional performance

28:50.960 --> 28:52.320
is actually very demanding.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.480
We have to constantly monitor

28:55.480 --> 28:56.640
whether our emotions

28:56.640 --> 28:58.560
really fit

28:58.560 --> 29:00.440
this set of emotional adjustment strategies.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.760
So it requires us to put in effort

29:04.760 --> 29:07.440
and put in our

29:07.440 --> 29:08.920
cognitive ability.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.120
Of course, as time goes by,

29:12.120 --> 29:13.640
the more effort you put in,

29:13.640 --> 29:16.440
the more pressure you may feel.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.760
It's not that surprising

29:18.760 --> 29:19.360
that some parents

29:19.360 --> 29:21.520
may have burnout.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.680
So this is a theoretical framework

29:22.680 --> 29:23.600
that we came up with.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.240
Why does positive parenting

29:25.240 --> 29:26.880
have something to do

29:26.880 --> 29:28.600
with the fact

29:28.600 --> 29:30.080
that our children are in this situation?

29:30.080 --> 29:33.000
We need to figure out

29:33.000 --> 29:34.160
how we can do this.

29:34.160 --> 29:37.800
We collected 347

29:37.800 --> 29:38.640
parents' data.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.800
We looked at

29:39.800 --> 29:41.600
whether the theoretical framework

29:41.600 --> 29:43.200
we came up with is true.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.480
We saw that

29:45.480 --> 29:47.160
the more parents

29:47.160 --> 29:49.560
understand our environment,

29:49.560 --> 29:52.760
the more they adopt

29:52.760 --> 29:55.120
positive parenting strategies.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.360
Positive parenting

29:57.360 --> 29:59.640
emotional performance strategies.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.320
The more they adopt

30:01.320 --> 30:02.360
surface acting

30:02.360 --> 30:04.160
or deep acting

30:04.160 --> 30:06.760
emotional performance

30:06.760 --> 30:08.200
emotional adjustment strategies,

30:08.200 --> 30:10.840
the more cognitive resources

30:10.840 --> 30:12.080
these parents use

30:12.080 --> 30:13.880
to make it easier for them

30:13.880 --> 30:16.920
to be affected by burnout.

30:16.920 --> 30:20.240
We also saw in our statistical analysis

30:20.240 --> 30:22.160
that this model

30:22.160 --> 30:25.560
is a great way to explain

30:25.560 --> 30:28.000
the data in our data.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.320
It's a great way to explain

30:31.320 --> 30:33.480
the results of our data.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.760
Okay.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.520
Basically,

30:36.520 --> 30:38.920
based on all the research

30:38.920 --> 30:40.560
we've done so far,

30:40.560 --> 30:42.280
from a top-down research approach,

30:42.280 --> 30:43.520
we can see that

30:43.520 --> 30:44.880
this cultural strategy,

30:44.920 --> 30:46.840
this cultural value

30:46.840 --> 30:47.880
of individualism

30:47.880 --> 30:49.800
and this cultural value

30:49.800 --> 30:50.760
of perfectionism

30:50.760 --> 30:51.640
will allow our parents

30:51.640 --> 30:53.920
to use a lot of

30:53.920 --> 30:55.960
emotional adjustment

30:55.960 --> 30:58.760
to further predict their burnout.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.400
From a bottom-up approach,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.160
we can see that

31:02.160 --> 31:03.240
if we want to describe

31:03.240 --> 31:05.040
Western culture,

31:05.040 --> 31:06.360
positive parenting,

31:06.360 --> 31:08.640
especially their emotional

31:08.640 --> 31:11.240
positive parenting,

31:11.240 --> 31:12.080
they have to

31:12.080 --> 31:13.520
show a lot of positive emotions.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.960
They have to control their emotions.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.520
Positive parenting

31:16.520 --> 31:19.480
will make our parents

31:19.480 --> 31:21.920
have to act emotionally

31:21.920 --> 31:24.680
in front of their children

31:24.680 --> 31:27.240
to explain their burnout.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.600
Combining these two aspects of research,

31:28.600 --> 31:29.720
we can see

31:29.720 --> 31:31.160
why this culture

31:31.160 --> 31:31.960
will make parents

31:31.960 --> 31:33.880
more likely to be affected by burnout.

31:33.880 --> 31:34.560
To a certain extent,

31:34.560 --> 31:35.600
it's because

31:35.600 --> 31:37.240
they've adopted

31:37.240 --> 31:39.040
very powerful emotional adjustment.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.120
They've adopted a lot of

31:41.120 --> 31:42.120
willful emotions

31:42.160 --> 31:43.560
in front of their children

31:43.560 --> 31:44.720
or they've adopted

31:44.720 --> 31:45.840
a powerful emotional adjustment

31:45.840 --> 31:48.360
to act in front of their children.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.080
At this time,

31:50.080 --> 31:52.080
as we said at the beginning,

31:52.080 --> 31:53.040
as researchers,

31:53.040 --> 31:56.160
we don't just want to stay

31:56.160 --> 31:57.960
in the theoretical framework.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.600
We also hope that

31:59.600 --> 32:00.840
the theoretical framework

32:00.840 --> 32:02.160
will be helpful

32:02.160 --> 32:03.200
to our parents

32:03.200 --> 32:05.240
and will be helpful

32:05.240 --> 32:07.680
to our food environment.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.400
So, for our theoretical framework,

32:10.400 --> 32:11.760
we also try to find

32:11.760 --> 32:12.440
ways to protect our children.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.320
We try to think from another perspective

32:15.320 --> 32:17.360
on how to help our parents.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.160
First of all, we just mentioned

32:19.160 --> 32:20.680
why Western culture

32:20.680 --> 32:21.440
will make parents

32:21.440 --> 32:23.120
more likely to be affected by burnout.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.640
It's because they've adopted

32:24.640 --> 32:25.920
more powerful

32:25.920 --> 32:27.880
emotional adjustment strategies.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.680
At this time, we want to say

32:29.680 --> 32:32.360
if we can stop this thing,

32:32.360 --> 32:33.840
we can prevent our parents

32:33.840 --> 32:35.520
from adopting so many

32:35.520 --> 32:41.360
negative emotional adjustments,

32:41.360 --> 32:43.680
will our parents be protected?

32:43.680 --> 32:45.760
From another perspective,

32:45.760 --> 32:48.040
if our parents

32:48.040 --> 32:50.360
can control their emotions

32:50.360 --> 32:54.480
more efficiently and intelligently,

32:54.480 --> 32:56.560
will their risk of

32:56.560 --> 32:57.640
child abuse

32:57.640 --> 32:59.800
be lower?

32:59.800 --> 33:01.360
Based on this study,

33:01.360 --> 33:04.480
we did our first study.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.240
We did our first study.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.520
We want to see

33:07.520 --> 33:08.440
if our parents

33:08.440 --> 33:10.720
really have a better ability

33:10.720 --> 33:13.200
to control their emotions,

33:13.200 --> 33:14.360
will their risk of child abuse

33:14.360 --> 33:16.760
be lower?

33:16.760 --> 33:18.720
Based on this study,

33:18.720 --> 33:20.080
we measured

33:20.080 --> 33:22.080
the emotional intelligence of parents,

33:22.080 --> 33:24.560
which is their ability to

33:24.560 --> 33:26.440
identify,

33:26.440 --> 33:27.520
to express,

33:27.520 --> 33:28.440
to understand,

33:28.440 --> 33:29.320
and to adjust

33:29.320 --> 33:30.360
and use their emotions.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.600
We want to see

33:31.600 --> 33:32.840
if this ability

33:32.840 --> 33:34.320
is related to

33:34.320 --> 33:35.680
child abuse.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.960
We collected data from different countries.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.600
We collected data from Belgium.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.520
We found that

33:41.520 --> 33:44.200
regardless of which measurement

33:44.200 --> 33:46.160
we used,

33:46.160 --> 33:48.160
regardless of which measurement

33:48.160 --> 33:50.160
we used,

33:50.160 --> 33:53.160
if our parents

33:53.160 --> 33:55.520
can use their emotions

33:55.520 --> 33:57.520
more intelligently,

33:57.520 --> 33:58.880
their risk of child abuse

33:58.880 --> 34:00.720
will be lower.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.600
Our emotional intelligence

34:02.600 --> 34:04.560
can predict the risk of

34:04.560 --> 34:05.800
child abuse

34:05.800 --> 34:07.600
for our parents.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.360
Indeed,

34:10.360 --> 34:12.680
if our parents have better emotional intelligence,

34:12.680 --> 34:14.000
we can protect them

34:14.000 --> 34:17.360
from the risk of child abuse.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.160
However,

34:18.160 --> 34:19.040
as we mentioned,

34:19.040 --> 34:21.520
we can see from the definition

34:21.520 --> 34:22.560
that emotional intelligence

34:22.560 --> 34:23.880
can include...

34:23.880 --> 34:25.000
We just mentioned

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
that it's related to

34:27.000 --> 34:28.280
identification,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.320
expression,

34:29.320 --> 34:31.800
understanding,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.160
and using emotions.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.920
It can be someone else's emotions

34:35.920 --> 34:37.440
or our own emotions.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.880
It can also be

34:38.880 --> 34:41.240
intrapersonal

34:41.240 --> 34:42.640
or interpersonal.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.480
Intrapersonal

34:44.480 --> 34:47.160
refers to a person

34:47.160 --> 34:48.840
who can

34:48.840 --> 34:50.360
identify,

34:50.360 --> 34:51.040
express,

34:51.040 --> 34:51.720
understand,

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
and adjust

34:52.720 --> 34:53.960
their own emotions.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.480
It can also be intrapersonal.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.480
It can identify,

34:59.480 --> 34:59.920
express,

34:59.920 --> 35:01.160
or understand

35:01.160 --> 35:02.760
other people's emotions.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.760
We want to ask

35:05.760 --> 35:09.360
if emotional intelligence

35:09.360 --> 35:11.440
can be classified

35:11.440 --> 35:13.240
as intrapersonal

35:13.240 --> 35:14.320
or interpersonal,

35:14.320 --> 35:15.840
will it have the same effect

35:15.840 --> 35:17.920
on child abuse?

35:17.920 --> 35:20.080
First of all,

35:20.080 --> 35:20.800
we collected...

35:20.800 --> 35:23.200
We used

35:23.200 --> 35:25.480
a different set of data.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.280
We collected data

35:27.280 --> 35:28.760
on parents

35:28.760 --> 35:30.440
and children.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.680
We found that

35:31.680 --> 35:33.400
if we only focus

35:33.400 --> 35:35.600
on

35:35.600 --> 35:37.160
parents

35:37.160 --> 35:39.560
who have

35:39.560 --> 35:41.880
better emotional intelligence,

35:41.880 --> 35:43.120
their child abuse,

35:43.120 --> 35:44.960
regardless of the country,

35:44.960 --> 35:45.840
we can see that

35:45.840 --> 35:47.440
this set of abilities

35:47.440 --> 35:49.600
can greatly reduce

35:49.600 --> 35:51.640
the chance of child abuse.

35:51.640 --> 35:52.640
However,

35:52.640 --> 35:54.480
if we only focus on

35:54.480 --> 35:55.960
controlling,

35:55.960 --> 35:56.880
understanding,

35:56.880 --> 35:58.600
and identifying other people's emotions,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.640
this intrapersonal competence

36:00.640 --> 36:03.720
affects our child abuse

36:03.760 --> 36:06.120
not only in proportion,

36:06.120 --> 36:07.160
but also in proportion.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.440
We can see that

36:08.440 --> 36:10.400
it basically predicts

36:10.400 --> 36:12.080
the effect of child abuse.

36:12.080 --> 36:12.840
In other words,

36:12.840 --> 36:15.720
from a humanistic perspective,

36:15.720 --> 36:16.920
in a humanistic language,

36:16.920 --> 36:19.320
it basically means

36:19.320 --> 36:20.400
understanding other people's emotions

36:20.400 --> 36:22.000
or using other people's emotions

36:22.000 --> 36:23.720
to do something related to others.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.000
This kind of emotional intelligence

36:25.000 --> 36:27.480
will put parents

36:27.480 --> 36:29.240
in danger.

36:29.240 --> 36:32.320
So we came to a conclusion.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.880
Interpersonal emotional intelligence

36:33.880 --> 36:37.120
not only has less positive effects,

36:37.120 --> 36:39.280
it may even

36:39.280 --> 36:40.240
put parents

36:40.240 --> 36:42.920
in more danger of child abuse.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.200
So,

36:45.200 --> 36:46.840
based on this study,

36:46.840 --> 36:48.880
to a certain extent,

36:48.880 --> 36:49.960
we can say that

36:49.960 --> 36:52.240
if we can

36:52.240 --> 36:54.760
help parents

36:54.760 --> 36:56.160
to control their emotions

36:56.160 --> 36:58.240
and understand their emotions better,

36:58.240 --> 37:00.520
their child abuse will be less.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.400
However,

37:01.400 --> 37:02.720
based on the second study,

37:02.720 --> 37:03.800
we actually need to

37:03.800 --> 37:06.440
further refine this study.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.000
Basically,

37:08.000 --> 37:09.800
only when parents

37:09.800 --> 37:11.080
are controlling

37:11.080 --> 37:13.120
their own emotions,

37:13.120 --> 37:14.960
their child abuse will be reduced.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.440
If we control other people's emotions,

37:17.440 --> 37:19.000
they may be more

37:19.000 --> 37:21.160
affected by child abuse.

37:21.160 --> 37:21.840
So, in fact,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.880
doing research is a bit like this.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.440
We will always look at

37:27.240 --> 37:28.120
different aspects more carefully.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.840
We may get different results.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.000
This is the first

37:32.000 --> 37:33.760
study conclusion we got.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.080
It actually brings

37:35.080 --> 37:36.440
a very important conclusion.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.720
If parents

37:37.720 --> 37:39.440
have better emotional intelligence,

37:39.440 --> 37:40.480
their child abuse

37:40.480 --> 37:41.880
will be less.

37:41.880 --> 37:44.160
In fact, the good news is

37:44.160 --> 37:45.280
that in our past studies,

37:45.280 --> 37:46.800
we have seen that

37:46.800 --> 37:47.600
as long as we spend

37:47.600 --> 37:49.680
15 hours,

37:49.680 --> 37:52.640
we can teach

37:52.640 --> 37:53.600
an individual

37:53.600 --> 37:56.200
how to learn

37:57.240 --> 37:59.520
and control our emotions

37:59.560 --> 38:00.880
or how to

38:00.880 --> 38:01.960
identify our emotions

38:01.960 --> 38:03.360
in a good way.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.360
From another perspective,

38:05.360 --> 38:08.960
we also care about

38:08.960 --> 38:10.840
individual's own ability

38:10.840 --> 38:12.560
and emotional intelligence.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.240
In fact, we are also curious

38:14.240 --> 38:15.360
if we can start from

38:15.360 --> 38:17.480
the interaction between people

38:17.480 --> 38:18.920
and the interaction between people

38:18.920 --> 38:19.680
to find some

38:19.680 --> 38:21.680
protective factors

38:21.680 --> 38:23.080
that can help parents.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.320
In fact, this perspective

38:24.320 --> 38:24.840
also comes from

38:24.840 --> 38:26.560
the research we just started.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.720
We see that

38:27.720 --> 38:30.200
the individual's

38:30.200 --> 38:33.600
individualism

38:33.600 --> 38:35.280
actually puts parents

38:35.280 --> 38:37.000
at risk of child abuse.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.280
We just mentioned

38:38.280 --> 38:39.560
what individualism is.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.040
Individualism refers to

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
a person who is very focused on

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
relying on himself.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.640
He is less dependent on other people's help.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.960
This kind of ability

38:48.960 --> 38:50.880
and this kind of cultural value.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.680
In fact, from another perspective,

38:52.680 --> 38:54.120
if our parents

38:54.120 --> 38:56.880
can rely on others better,

38:56.920 --> 38:59.000
if they can get

38:59.000 --> 39:00.360
the resources from others better,

39:00.360 --> 39:01.280
that is, if they have better

39:01.280 --> 39:02.600
social support,

39:02.600 --> 39:04.640
the chances of child abuse

39:04.640 --> 39:06.720
will be less.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.280
So we also proposed this assumption.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.920
If parents have better

39:09.920 --> 39:11.200
social support,

39:11.200 --> 39:12.400
the chances of child abuse

39:12.400 --> 39:14.400
will be lower.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.160
So to answer this question,

39:16.160 --> 39:19.120
we collected data from

39:19.120 --> 39:22.760
different countries,

39:22.760 --> 39:23.320
whether they are

39:23.320 --> 39:24.680
individualist countries

39:24.680 --> 39:26.520
or non-individualist countries.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.040
We collected data from Turkey.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.240
We collected data from Peru.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.600
We collected data from Poland and Belgium.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.840
We collected data from

39:35.840 --> 39:37.320
any country.

39:37.320 --> 39:38.240
We can see that

39:38.240 --> 39:40.720
in the results of the return analysis,

39:40.720 --> 39:42.240
we controlled all

39:44.240 --> 39:45.720
the data on population changes.

39:45.720 --> 39:46.800
We found that

39:46.800 --> 39:49.280
our parents' social support

39:49.280 --> 39:51.440
is indeed one of the most important

39:51.440 --> 39:53.640
protective measures

39:53.640 --> 39:55.920
to protect our parents

39:55.920 --> 39:58.480
from child abuse.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.000
So from this result,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.040
we actually learned

40:01.040 --> 40:02.840
another thing.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.880
In fact, as long as we can

40:03.880 --> 40:06.000
let our parents understand

40:06.000 --> 40:07.400
that when they are

40:07.400 --> 40:08.600
taking care of their children,

40:08.600 --> 40:09.880
when they are interacting

40:09.880 --> 40:11.480
with their children,

40:11.480 --> 40:13.560
they are not alone.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.120
In fact, if they can

40:15.120 --> 40:16.840
get resources from their environment,

40:16.840 --> 40:18.800
our parents can

40:18.800 --> 40:22.200
avoid the risk of

40:22.200 --> 40:23.160
being abducted

40:23.160 --> 40:25.480
and abducted.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.800
So basically, this is a very important

40:28.800 --> 40:30.320
second protective factor that we saw.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.160
At the end, I want to sum up

40:33.160 --> 40:35.200
the different studies

40:35.200 --> 40:36.680
I talked about today

40:36.680 --> 40:38.040
to make a conclusion.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.280
In fact, through these six

40:40.280 --> 40:41.480
series of studies,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.160
what information did we get?

40:43.160 --> 40:44.760
The first message we got was

40:44.760 --> 40:45.680
that Western culture

40:45.680 --> 40:47.320
does put parents

40:47.320 --> 40:48.960
at risk of child abduction.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.400
We saw from the top-down approach

40:51.400 --> 40:52.520
that Western individualism,

40:52.520 --> 40:54.320
especially their perfectionism,

40:54.320 --> 40:55.400
will make parents

40:55.400 --> 40:59.040
take more suppression,

40:59.040 --> 41:03.080
emotional adjustment.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.440
On the other hand,

41:04.440 --> 41:05.360
we can see from the bottom-up

41:05.360 --> 41:07.240
research approach

41:07.240 --> 41:08.360
that what can show

41:08.360 --> 41:09.600
Western parenting

41:09.600 --> 41:10.800
is positive education,

41:10.800 --> 41:12.640
especially positive emotions,

41:12.640 --> 41:13.560
controlling each other's emotions,

41:13.560 --> 41:15.360
such a positive parenting strategy.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.440
It will make our parents

41:16.440 --> 41:18.040
feel like they have to

41:18.040 --> 41:20.000
act in front of their children,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.440
especially in terms of emotions.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.400
No matter what kind of emotional adjustment,

41:25.400 --> 41:27.200
suppression or emotional labor,

41:27.200 --> 41:29.400
they are all very powerful.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.320
These powerful emotional adjustments

41:31.320 --> 41:32.920
will naturally make parents

41:32.920 --> 41:34.080
more likely to be affected

41:34.080 --> 41:36.480
by child abduction.

41:36.480 --> 41:40.000
Through this theoretical framework,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.600
we also try to understand

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
another thing.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.560
Indeed, Western culture

41:44.560 --> 41:45.880
will make our parents

41:45.880 --> 41:47.880
more likely to be affected by child abduction,

41:47.880 --> 41:49.640
but our environment...

41:49.640 --> 41:51.040
But from another perspective,

41:51.040 --> 41:52.560
if we can teach our parents

41:52.560 --> 41:55.480
how to better interact

41:55.480 --> 42:00.560
with their emotions,

42:00.560 --> 42:01.920
or if we can find ways

42:01.920 --> 42:03.040
to get more social support

42:03.040 --> 42:04.840
from our parents,

42:04.840 --> 42:06.520
it can actually protect our parents

42:06.520 --> 42:09.640
from being affected by child abduction.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.560
These are the two most important

42:12.560 --> 42:15.160
take-home messages

42:15.160 --> 42:16.600
in my speech today.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.040
Today, I basically

42:19.040 --> 42:20.480
summarized my research

42:20.480 --> 42:21.440
over the past two years

42:21.440 --> 42:23.960
in a very quick overview.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.440
I listed the eight articles

42:25.440 --> 42:27.880
that we published in the past,

42:27.880 --> 42:29.560
which is the main

42:31.440 --> 42:33.520
take-home message I reported today.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.560
You can see that

42:34.560 --> 42:36.960
our lab and I

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
put our past articles

42:38.960 --> 42:42.240
on our lab website.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.360
If you are interested

42:43.360 --> 42:45.120
in learning more about the details,

42:45.120 --> 42:46.720
especially in today's speech,

42:46.720 --> 42:48.720
I didn't...

42:48.720 --> 42:50.480
I didn't go into the details of statistics

42:50.480 --> 42:52.640
or analysis.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.480
If you are interested

42:54.480 --> 42:55.600
in the details,

42:55.600 --> 42:57.960
you can read these articles

42:57.960 --> 42:59.960
directly.

42:59.960 --> 43:00.520
Okay.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.480
In the end,

43:02.480 --> 43:03.920
we have to talk about

43:03.920 --> 43:06.320
some guidelines in all our research.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.440
As I said in my speech today,

43:08.440 --> 43:10.320
it's like I'm the only one

43:10.320 --> 43:11.960
doing all this research.

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
But it's not like that.

43:12.960 --> 43:13.560
All the research

43:13.560 --> 43:16.320
is a joint effort

43:16.320 --> 43:17.920
for all of us.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.720
So, I have to say thank you.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.280
First of all,

43:21.280 --> 43:23.080
of course, my two professors

43:23.080 --> 43:24.960
and my long-term

43:24.960 --> 43:26.240
partners.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.800
The most important thing is

43:27.800 --> 43:30.720
that we have hundreds of

43:30.720 --> 43:32.800
researchers all over the world.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.000
We are also

43:34.000 --> 43:35.960
doing research on

43:35.960 --> 43:37.000
the concept of parent-child bondage

43:37.000 --> 43:38.880
and trying to find ways

43:38.880 --> 43:41.080
to help our parents.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.920
So, we have to thank

43:42.920 --> 43:44.480
all the partners

43:44.480 --> 43:46.680
and researchers

43:46.680 --> 43:48.000
who have worked together.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.200
Lastly,

43:49.200 --> 43:51.120
as we have been talking about

43:51.120 --> 43:51.960
in the research,

43:51.960 --> 43:53.120
some parents

43:53.120 --> 43:54.600
are already very bondage.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.840
They may have

43:56.840 --> 43:59.160
been affected by parent-child bondage.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.520
But they still

44:00.520 --> 44:02.600
spend their precious time

44:02.600 --> 44:04.560
to help us fill in

44:04.560 --> 44:05.480
these questions

44:05.480 --> 44:07.920
or help us complete our research.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.480
So, we have to thank

44:09.480 --> 44:12.080
our parents

44:12.080 --> 44:13.200
especially parents

44:13.200 --> 44:14.600
from different countries

44:14.600 --> 44:17.040
who have done so much for us.

44:17.040 --> 44:17.600
Okay.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.640
So, this is a quick overview

44:19.640 --> 44:21.360
of my presentation today.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.600
It took me about 45 minutes in total.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.480
So, I have about

44:26.480 --> 44:28.000
10 to 15 minutes left.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.320
If you have any questions,

44:29.320 --> 44:31.360
we can discuss them together.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.080
Thank you, Ya Hui.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.080
Thank you, Gao Xian.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.920
On behalf of the audience,

44:35.920 --> 44:38.800
I would like to say thank you to Gao Xian

44:38.800 --> 44:41.240
for bringing a very comprehensive

44:41.240 --> 44:44.400
and rich presentation.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.360
If I were not a student

44:47.360 --> 44:49.520
doing research in this field,

44:49.520 --> 44:50.400
I would be able to

44:50.400 --> 44:52.520
understand the essence of this topic

44:52.520 --> 44:56.160
in your 45-minute presentation.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.600
So, thank you, Gao Xian.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.280
At this stage,

44:59.280 --> 45:02.320
I would like to pause the recording

45:02.320 --> 45:03.880
and we can start

45:03.880 --> 45:05.400
Q&A and various discussions.
