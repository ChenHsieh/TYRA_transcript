00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Today is October 8th, 2022, Taira Talk.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
The speaker we invited today is Ms. Zheng Huaijie.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
The topic she will talk about is

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Jupiter Hub, a mini studio,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
an open science cloud base.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Let me briefly introduce Huaijie's background.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
In 2010 and 2013, Huaijie obtained a master's and a master's degree in Taiwan University.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
In 2015, she went to Cornell University

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
for a PhD in Earth and Atmospheric Science.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
In 2021, Huaijie joined a research team at the University of California, Berkeley.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
She is now working as a post-PhD researcher

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
on the Jupiter-Meet-the-Earth project.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
Today, Huaijie will teach us about Jupiter Hub.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
She also mentioned that you don't need any background knowledge or program design skills to participate in this talk.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
However, if you want to store Jupiter resources at the same time during the talk,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
you must prepare a Google or Microsoft account.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Please prepare for the third part of the talk.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
That's all for my introduction.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Let's give the floor to Huaijie.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Thank you, Shi-An.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Thank you for your introduction.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
It's an honor to be able to invite Tara to give a talk.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
My last talk was in January this year.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
I would like to share with you what I am doing at UC Berkeley.

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
Instead of sharing, I would like to focus on Jupiter Hub.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
I would like to share with you what Jupiter Hub is

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
and why we call it the cloud base of open science.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
How it can transform our practice of open science.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Let's get started.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
I would like to share with you what I am doing at the moment.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I would like to add a little bit.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
My field of expertise is earth science.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
To be more precise, I am studying earth physics,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
rock science,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
meteorology,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
and astrophysics.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
What I am doing at the moment is

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
using a lot of satellite data

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
and model analysis

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
to monitor and understand the changes in ice and snow.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
For example,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
you can see a satellite here.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It orbits the earth

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
and emits green light.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
When it hits the ground,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
the satellite will receive the reflected light.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Based on the reflected light,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
we can calculate the distance between the satellite and the earth,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
and convert it to the height of the earth.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
If we can do this repeatedly for an ice cube,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
we can get an ice cube

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
with the time passing by,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
the height of the surface,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
or the thickness of the ice.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Then we use some physical models

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
to analyze

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
the factors

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
that affect the thickness of the ice cube.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It sounds cool,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
and I like it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
However, most of the academic activities

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
that I am doing now

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
are similar to what you are doing.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
We need to study

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
and explain our research

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
to others,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
including colleagues

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
and people

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
in different fields.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
In addition to research,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
we also have teaching activities

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
where we write software

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
for others.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I have done some of these.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Here are some pictures

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
of what I have done

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
in the past few years,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
including developing a software

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
called KARS.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I also wrote a website

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
called GMT Tutorials.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
In short,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I teach others

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
how to draw pictures

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
using GMT software.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
The picture in the lower right corner

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
is from a paper

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I published in 2019.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
At that time,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I discussed with the paper publisher

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
how to make some materials

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
that can be more efficient

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
and faster

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
to convey

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
some new knowledge

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
of the paper

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and make it

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
into a news article.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Back to our topic today,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
we are going to talk about JupyterHub.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
How can we change

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
the academic activities

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
we do every day?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Before we talk about JupyterHub,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
let's talk about

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
the concept of Jupyter.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
If I were to explain

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
what Jupyter is,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I would say that

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Jupyter is an open

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
data science...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Sorry. Jupyter is an ecosystem

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
composed of open data science tools

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and a community

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
of open data scientists.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
There might be some professional terminology here,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
so I'll explain a little more.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
The so-called tools here mean

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
that if you want to complete

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
a task,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
the tools you use...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
For example,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Photoshop

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
is a tool

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
for video editing.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Matplotlib

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
is a tool

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
used in Python

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
for scientific mapping.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Something like that.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
As for the word

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
open,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
it's a little vague.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
To be honest,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
many different aspects

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
are considered to be open.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
For example,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
it can refer to the tools you use.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
The source code

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
may be public,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
and anyone can modify it.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
On the other hand,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
the way you collaborate

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
allows as many people

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
as possible to participate

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and contribute and discuss.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Anyway,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
the core concept of

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
the word open

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
is

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
not to be excluded,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
but to allow as many people

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
as possible to participate

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
in what you are doing now.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So we have a lot of tools.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Some tools are software,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
some tools are hardware,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and some tools

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
are used to describe

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
how software and hardware

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
interact with each other.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
These tools are different

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
from other tools.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Think about it.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
If you put a tool under a tool,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
a screwdriver may be used to lock the screw,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
and a crowbar may be used

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
to twist the wire.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
These tools are independent.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
In data science,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
the so-called tools

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
often rely on each other.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
For example,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
if you want to use Matplotlib today,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
you have to install Python first.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
After installing Python,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
you can install Matplotlib,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and it will work.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
If you draw the interdependence

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
between different tools,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
you will see a picture

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
that looks like a network,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
or a food chain.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So we tend to

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
call the interdependence

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
between tools

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
and their interdependence

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
an ecosystem.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
An ecosystem like Jupyter

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
is not very old.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
The concept of open science

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
has only appeared

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
for about 20 years

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
so far.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
You may feel shorter.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
In the first ten years,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
it was in the early stages.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Not many people

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
were completely exposed

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
to this concept.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
One of the most likely

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
time to accept this exposure

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
is 2015.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
At that time,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Lego released

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
the first gravity wave observation

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
in human history.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It shocked the world.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
They won the Nobel Prize

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
in 2017 or 2018.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Lego

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
did more than

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
this.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Of course,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
they are very good

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
at writing articles

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
and building observatories.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
But they also have

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
an open science department.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
This department

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
has compiled all the data

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
about the gravity wave observation

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and posted it on the Internet.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Everyone can

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
go to their website

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
and click on their link.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You can re-execute the code

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and draw the same picture

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
as in their paper.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I will share

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
my video later.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You can click on the link

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
to see what it is.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
After 2015,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
if you use Twitter,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
you may see

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
more and more people

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
on Twitter

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
saying

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
how great the open science department is.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
It can make me do things

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I couldn't do before.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
For example,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
this person used his phone

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
to analyze the data

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
of CIMIP-6 on the train.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
If you don't know what CIMIP-6 is,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
it is a global

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
climate simulation database.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It generates

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
TBG data every day.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The data

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
is huge.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It is not easy

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
to analyze the data

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
on the train

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
with a smart phone.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
What's more,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
NASA has announced

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
that

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
next year, 2023,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
will be their open science year.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
They have a big project

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
called TOPS,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Transform to Open Science.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Starting from next year,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
it will take about 4 to 5 years.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
They will

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
manage and

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
publish the data

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
in a big way.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
After next year,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
they will

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
adopt a new model,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
a more open science model,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
to manage and publish

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
their data

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
work flow

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and research results.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
This is a trend.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
We can see this trend.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Everyone is talking about it.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Of course, thanks to the development of technology,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
we now have

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
different ways

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
to practice

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
open science.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Here is an example.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
We know that open science

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
is a very common term.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
There are many

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
different ways to practice it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Here is an example.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You can see

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
these pictures.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Let's say there is a researcher

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
named Jim.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
He just wrote a cool paper

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
and published it.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
He wants

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
more. He wants to say

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
that he wants this paper

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
to be

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
supported by

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
other people.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
He wants everyone

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
to be able to

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
see his paper,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
check for errors,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
and even

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
re-examine his experiment,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
and even

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
improve

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
his calculations

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
in the paper.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
What can he do?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Here is a method.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
He can use

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Jupyter Notebook.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
In this file,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
he can put all the details of the research,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
including narrative text,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
including city code,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
including

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
many interactive

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
or non-interactive icons,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
as well as more background resources,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
such as primitive data,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
multimedia,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and software, etc.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
After he has

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
this Jupyter Notebook,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
he can put it in a

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
network storage

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
so that everyone can read it.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
A more popular storage is

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
GitHub.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
He can put it on GitHub

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
so that everyone can see it.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
After uploading,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
he does more things

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
to make

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
this storage

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
called

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Finder Ready.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Simply put,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
he can provide additional information,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
such as

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
what kind of software

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
you need

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
to run the notebook

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
in this storage,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
such as Python,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
R,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Julia, or Matlab.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
He can provide

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
background information

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
and make a

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
set of files.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
He can arrange

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
the files.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
When all these things are ready,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
we can use

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
a tool called

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Docker

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
to

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
make this entire storage

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
into

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
an

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
independent

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
image.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
It's like

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
a mini

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
execution environment.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
In this environment,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
you can

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
use the same environment

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
to run these programs.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Now, all you have to do is

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
share this Docker image

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
to other people around the world.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Then other people

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
can perfectly reproduce your research

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
without

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
additional installation of

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
many beautiful softwares.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
The above is

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
one of the examples

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
of open science.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It allows people to

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
quickly save

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
their own research materials.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
How does JupyterHub

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
contribute

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
to

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
the

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
data science process?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
If I were to

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
explain what JupyterHub is,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I would say that

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
JupyterHub is a tool

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
that provides

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
convenient data science environment

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
on a shared computer.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
What is a

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
shared computer?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Simply put,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
suppose you have

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
a computer in your lab,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and everyone can log in

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
and do something on it,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
such as

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
writing articles, processing data,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
writing papers, and so on.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
The server

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
you can log in to

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
and store

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
the CPU or GPU

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
resources in it

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
is called a shared computer.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Traditionally,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I guess some of you

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
may have used it,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
such as SSH,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
to a remote server and do something on it.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Of course,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
you have to install a lot of things

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
in order to do

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
what you want to do on the server.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
JupyterHub

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
eliminates these steps.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
It provides some pre-set

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
configurations

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
so that you can

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
go to the server

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
without doing anything

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and start

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
your data science analysis.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Here is a picture

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
of the concept

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
of JupyterHub.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You can imagine

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
that there are a lot of people here.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
They are going to store

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
a machine like this.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
JupyterHub is running on the machine.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Everyone has to pass a verification first.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
When they successfully

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
log in to the machine,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
JupyterHub will provide

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
several standard interfaces

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
for them to choose from,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
such as the Jupyter Notebook interface.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Then they can start

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
storing the computing resources

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
in the machine

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
through this interface.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Note that the computing resources

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
are separate from JupyterHub.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
JupyterHub

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
can also prepare several

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
different computing environments.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
For example, it can prepare

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
a Python environment.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
If I need it,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I can log in to JupyterHub

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
and call the Python environment

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
and say I want to use Python this time.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
At the same time,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
JupyterHub can also prepare

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
another environment

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
that is completely built

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
on different tools.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
If others want to use it,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
they can call it out at any time.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
So JupyterHub

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
is a layer of disassembly

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
of such a work structure

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
to make it easier

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
for open science and cooperation.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Here is another example

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
to explain

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
how JupyterHub

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
can achieve

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
the goal we want,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
that is, the goal of sharing the environment.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Let's say there is a professor

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
named John.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
He is now leading

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
a large-scale research project.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
This large-scale research project

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
has already

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
pre-configured

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
the software he wants to use.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
For example, he may want to use Python

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
for the first time.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
He says this is the environment I want.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
How does JupyterHub

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
tell others

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
to use this environment?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
We provide a method

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
that allows JupyterHub

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
to cooperate with

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
the IT staff of the school.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
JupyterHub will send

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
an application form

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
to the IT staff

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and say

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
this is the environment

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I want to design.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
This is the environment I want to provide.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
These environments

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
will be configured

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
in a configuration file

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
for the IT staff.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
After receiving this file,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
JupyterHub will

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
refer to the settings

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
and open

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
a thing called Workspace Manager.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
In this example,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Workspace Manager is JupyterHub.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
So I call it JupyterHub.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The IT staff will open JupyterHub

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
in the computer of the school.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
JupyterHub will read

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
the file provided

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and configure

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
the work environment

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
you need,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
including Python,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
etc.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Finally,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
JupyterHub will run

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
on the cloud server

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
of the school.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
After it is configured,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
it will generate

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
a Docker file.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's a bit like...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If I talk too much

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and you don't understand,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
please ask me later.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It will generate a Docker file

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
a URL.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
After

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
getting this URL,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
you can send it

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
to anyone

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
including students

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
and their collaborators.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
They can connect to

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
the JupyterHub login page.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
As long as

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
they can verify their identity

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
and log in,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
they can save

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
the JupyterHub

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
running on the cloud

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
and all the

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
environment configuration

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
are ready.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
No need to install anything else.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
This is the concept of

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
sharing the environment.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
That's all for the introduction.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Since this is a mini workshop,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
let's try

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
what JupyterHub is.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
The JupyterHub we want

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
is

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
a Kalisto

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
organization.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Kalisto

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
has

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
two

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
non-profit organizations

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
in Canada.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Their main goal

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
is to

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
provide

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
high school teachers

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
in Canada

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
with sufficient resources

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
to teach students

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
how to do

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
data science

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
and

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
various teaching modules.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Their

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
own JupyterHub is called

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
KalistoHub.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
JupyterHub is the name

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
of the tool.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
The tool

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
is used to

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
connect the tool

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
to the cloud.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
KalistoHub

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
is the Kalisto

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
organization.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
They use JupyterHub

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
to connect

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
the Kalisto

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
organization

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
to the cloud.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
This is

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
my video link.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This is Kalisto's

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
website.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I will continue to share my screen.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Can you see that I am

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
on Kalisto's page?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Yes.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Can you hear me?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yes.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Thank you.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
There is a KalistoHub

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
icon in the upper right corner.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Click it.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
You will see

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
that you can

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
log in.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Log in with your account.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
It will ask you

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
if you want Google or Microsoft.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You can choose what you want.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I have Google.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
This is my

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Berkeley account.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I will show you.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
When you log in,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
you will see this screen.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You are preparing.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Oh, this is not what I want.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Let me do it again.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I want to log in a new one.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Log in.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Log in with my Gmail.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
OK.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
After you log in,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
you will see a page like this.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
This page is

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
one of the standard

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
interface of

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Kalisto.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We usually call it

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Notebook interface.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Is everyone OK?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Do you need to wait?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I am OK.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Is BlueJeans

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
available?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Can you show me

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
if you need

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
more time?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
He can raise his hand.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But I am not sure

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
what will happen.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Oh, OK.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Oh, Weiwei.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Let me pull out the chat window.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Now you can use the chat window

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
to let me know where you are.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
But I don't know how to pull it out.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Anyway,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
let's continue.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
When you see this page,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
it means you have successfully logged in

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
to Kalisto Hub.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
You have successfully logged in

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
to Kalisto Hub,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
and you have started using

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
the computing resources provided by them.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
There will be a

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
file list here.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
You will see a file called

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Getting Started.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
You will see a page

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
like this.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
This is how

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Jupyter Notebook

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
looks like

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
under the Notebook interface.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
You can see that

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
this is a Notebook file.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
It looks very diverse,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
but if you click twice

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
on each block,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
you will see their

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
original information.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
The original information

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
is actually some words.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
These words

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
are written in Markdown format.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
So when you are in editing mode,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
you can edit as you like.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
For example,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I can type blah blah

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
under this block.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Then,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
when you click Run,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
it will re-

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
change this block to display mode.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Like this.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
You can see blah blah

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
under this block.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
As I said,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
this is a Jupyter Notebook,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
so you can also

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
compute directly on it.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
For example,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
we can add some blocks

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
under this Notebook

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
by clicking Add.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
We can click

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
a block

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and type

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Hello World.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
In the upper right corner,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you can see

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
what is the core

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
of this Notebook.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Here it says

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Python 3,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
which means that

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
when you click Run,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Notebook will run

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
these programs

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
in Python.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
For example,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I can type

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
hello world

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
print a.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
After typing,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
if you click Run,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
it will run this program

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
in Python.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
If you want to add

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
more columns,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
you can also

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
change the block type

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
from Code

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
to Markdown.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
You can type here

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
like

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Today is

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Ira's speech.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
After running,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
it will become

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
the narrative text

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
in your Notebook.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
What I like

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
about Python Notebook

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
is the narrative text

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
The Markdown

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
supports LaTeX,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
so you can type

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
mathematical formulas here.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
For example,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I can type

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
what?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Q

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
equals

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
OK

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
times

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
partial T

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
partial X

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
This is a

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Parallelism.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Then a Parallelism

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
will appear.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
If you traditionally use LaTeX,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
it's hard to mix and match like this,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
especially when

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
there is Chinese in your article.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Traditionally,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
LaTeX is very difficult to process

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Chinese content,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
but

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
in Jupyter Markdown,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
because it

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
originally supports UTF,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
you can perfectly

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
mix these two things together.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's very convenient.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Is it OK so far?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Should we pause or continue?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I'm OK.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Do you have any questions?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Although there may be something to trouble you,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I always look at the chat box,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
so if there are any questions

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
in the chat,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
can you interrupt me a little?

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
OK.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Or if you see someone raising their hand,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
you can interrupt me at any time.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I will help you pay attention to these.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
You can continue.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Thank you.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
We just talked about

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Jupyter Notebook and Core.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
These two things are separate.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Depending on the user's needs,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
we can switch between different cores.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
So let's switch to a different core.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Let's try not to use Python now.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
If you move the mouse

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
to the menu above,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
then select Kernel.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Then,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
at the bottom of the Kernel,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
there is a Change Kernel.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
You will see that

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
there are two cores in Callisto Hub.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
One is Python, the other is R.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Let's try R.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Now,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
this Jupyter Notebook

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
is running R,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
not Python.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
If we re-run

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Hello World,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
it will...

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Oh, this part is still useful.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Because there is also this part in R.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
But the syntax of R itself

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
is like this.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
This part of Python

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
cannot be executed.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Something like this.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Run.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It will execute

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
this part of the program

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
in the way of R.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
If you draw a picture on it,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
for example,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
let's quickly make an X.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
This is the program of R,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
so if you don't understand,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
you are welcome to ask me anytime.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
But now,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I have to set five data points.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Then draw these five data points.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Then I can press

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Shift and Enter

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
to run this program.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Then it will call the jpg in R

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
to draw this thing.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
For the jpg in Python,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
the jpg in Python

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
is also similar.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Now,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
we change the kernel

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
back to Python.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Change.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Then we bring it to the bottom.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Let's try it.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Use Python to draw.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
In Python,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
you have to enter some jpgs first.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
For example,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
here,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I call

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
matplotlib and

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
numpy

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
to do things for me.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Then,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
roughly like this,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
you can draw a picture of Sine.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
You can see that these two pictures

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
look very different.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
To some extent,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
they are actually two different jpg sets.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The one above is R.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The one below is Python.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Of course, if you want,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
you can also save this picture.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
We can add one more command,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
and we call it

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
test.png.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
After drawing,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
after re-executing,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
test.png

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
will appear in the file list.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
If we go back to the file list,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
File,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
File, then Open,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
you will go back to the file list screen.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
You will see that

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
a new file called test has appeared.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Open it,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
you can see this png file.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You can also select it,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
and then download it.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
The download button is

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
here,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
this part of the top row.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You can download it to your own computer.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
The above is a simple

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
way to operate

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
the notebook interface.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You can find that we are really using

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
JupyterHub,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
the computing resources provided by Callisto

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to help you do some scientific analysis.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Of course, it also has

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
some traditional

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
4-in-1 operating modes.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
If you move the mouse

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
to the New

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
on the list,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
press it,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
you will see several options.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You can open a new notebook.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
You can also open other types of files.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
There is a file here

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
called Terminal.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
After pressing it,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you can turn on

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
a traditional terminal,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
and then operate

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
what you want to operate,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
such as LOS or

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
PWD, etc.,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
anything you want.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
What I want to show you here is

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
the so-called installation settings.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
This command needs to wait,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
because it uses

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Conda,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
a settings software,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
to install the settings.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
It's a software,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
and sometimes it takes a long time.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But...

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It looks like there's still some time.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
But...

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Oh, I'm out.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You can see that

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
it's already pre-installed.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
There are a lot of settings pre-installed,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
including...

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
For example, in Python,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
because I'm more familiar with Python,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
you can see that

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
there are

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Dask,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
a set of parallel algorithms,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
and then, for example,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
there's Geopandas,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
a set of geospatial data,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
and then, for example,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
there's also

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
HDF5,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
a set of HDF files,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
as well as

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
a variety of

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
other kinds of

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
settings.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Of course, there's also Matplotlib here,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and other different

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
visualizations, such as

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I think it should have Cborn installed.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Cborn is

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
probably here.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Scientific analysis is more common,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
like SciPy,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
or non-Python files.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
As you can see,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
if someone can help you

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
pre-install these settings,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
then you don't have to

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
spend so much effort

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
to install the settings,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and deal with the problems of

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
each other's reliance.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Sometimes these problems

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
will greatly hinder

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
the progress of a research.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
So, is it still OK here?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
If it's still OK,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
we'll move on to the next stage.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I'm OK.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
OK, OK.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
OK, let's go back to

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
the file list.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
In this file list,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
we just talked about

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Notebook Entry,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
which is a traditional

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Github interface.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I want to introduce

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
a relatively new

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
interface called Lab.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
The way to save it is

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
to cut off the tree

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
in the file list,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
and change it to Lab.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Then,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
enter it.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
When you do this,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
you will enter

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
another interface

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
called Lab.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
If you need

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
some information,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
you can go back to our video.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
There should be steps

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
in the following videos.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The interface of Lab

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
looks a little different

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
from that of Notebook.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The biggest difference is

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
that the interface of Lab

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
consists of many different small panels.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
For example, the left panel

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
is for file browsing,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and the right panel

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
is for test.png.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
You can click twice

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and the right panel

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
will show the test.png.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Of course,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the Notebook is already open

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
and you can see the information

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
is still there.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So they actually

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
store the same server,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
but with different interfaces.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
What can we do

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
with the Notebook?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You can see

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
a blue plus sign in the upper left corner.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Click it

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
to open the start page.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
In the start page,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
you can choose

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
what kind of content you want to start.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You can start a notebook

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
with Python as the core,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
or with R as the core.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Or you can

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
start a terminal

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and do the same thing as before,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
like start with S.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
As I said,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
the best selling point of Lab

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
is that it has different panels

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
for window browsing.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
The advantage of doing this

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
is that you can compare the two.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
For example,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
if you go back to the iPad and Notebook

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
and move to the bottom of the page,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and click the right button

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
to see the list,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
you can see that there are a lot of lists.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
One of them is called

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Create New View for Output.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Click it.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
This picture will move to a new panel.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
You can move it around.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
It's like

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
many powerful software

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
these days.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You can compare it with different pictures.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
For example, I can re-draw one.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I'll change it to Cosine.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Re-draw.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Oh, this is also a comparison.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But I can change it.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Copy.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Do the same thing.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
But here I want to make it Sine.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Re-draw.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Then you can compare this picture

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
with this picture.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
And so on.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
JupyterLab

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
also supports a lot of other

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
not only Notebook,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
but also a lot of other file display modes.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
For example, if you click the PNG file,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
it will jump out of the PNG file.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
If you click the CSV file,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
it can also display the CSV file

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
in a display way.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And so on.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It also has

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
some more gorgeous settings.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
For example,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
if you move to the

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
list above,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
there is a list called

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Settings.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The first one is Scene.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Here you can choose

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
whether to use

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
bright colors or dark colors.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
The default is bright colors.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
But I prefer dark colors.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So I'll change it to dark colors.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Let's see what happens.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's dark colors.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
In addition,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
you can do more customization.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
For example,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
if you open Settings,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
there is a Language.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
But at the moment,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
there is only English language.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
But we can install Chinese language.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
For example,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
if we go to Terminal,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
and use pip,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
to install...

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
What's the name of this package?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
It's called

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
JupyterLab

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Language Pack.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Chinese.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Taiwan.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Something like that.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Install.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Then it will start to install.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That's right.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
You are now installing

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
the package you want on

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
a server called CallistoHub.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
After installation,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
you need to re-organize this lab.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Just click on Re-organize.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Then the whole lab will be re-organized.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
So,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
if you go to Settings,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Language,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
you should see Chinese.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
You can choose Chinese or Taiwanese.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Go in.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Then Reload.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
The JupyterLab with Chinese version

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
will appear.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Maybe it's not that perfect.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
You can see some of them are not translated.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Because the JupyterLab

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
translation project

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
is still in progress.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
They are all public projects.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So if you are interested in contributing,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
you can ask me.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I can send you the link.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
But you can also google

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
the translation project link.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So far, I don't know if you have any questions.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
OK.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I don't see any questions.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
That's great.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It seems that everyone is very

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
into the situation.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I don't know.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Does everyone follow?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I'm following.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
It doesn't matter.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
OK.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Because if you want to repeat it later,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
you can refer to my first video.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
There should be some details in the video

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
to explain how to do these things.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
The last part,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I want to share with you

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
some of the functions of Hub.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So if we go to

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
the menu,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
File,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
and then the second one,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
you should see the Hub control panel

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
or Hub control panel.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
If you don't know how to install Chinese,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
it's called Hub control panel.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Click it.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
A control panel will pop up.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Wow, it's so bright.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
If you don't mind,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I'll turn on a light.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Because it's getting dark here.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I'll be right back.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
OK.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
On this control panel,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
you should only see two options.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
The first option is

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
to stop

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
the server just now.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Now,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
click it.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Let's try to click

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
this dot.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Now the server has been stopped.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
If we go back to the previous page,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
you can see

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
the server is unavailable or unreachable.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Because the server has been stopped.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But we can restart it.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
So,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
we can click here

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
to restart.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Or we can go back to the previous page

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
and click Start My Server.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It's up to you.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Let's restart it.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
OK.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It's done.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
The preset interface will be

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
the notebook interface.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
But you can see

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
the generated files are still there.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
The test.png is still there.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
However,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
if you switch to the lab interface,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
you may find something

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
different.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Let's take a look.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
OK.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
If you click

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
the menu,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
you may find the Chinese file is gone.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Why?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Why is the file still there,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
but

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
the Chinese file is gone?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Here,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I'd like to use this observation

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
to explain the full line

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
of JupyterHub.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
If you are a JupyterHub

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
administrator,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
you can set the files or structures

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
in JupyterHub

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
which parts can't be changed by the user,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
and which parts can be changed by the user.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
However, when you finish this server,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
it will reset.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
The file we installed just now

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
has been reset.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
If you want to re-install JupyterHub,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
you have to install it again.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
However,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
the administrator can also decide

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
which parts can be saved

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
by the user forever.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
In other words,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
if you just generate the files

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
in those places,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
you can save these files.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Every time you restart JupyterHub,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
these files will not disappear.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
For example, the test.png

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
will always be saved

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
in this server.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
As far as I know,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
there is a time limit

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
in Kalisto.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
If you don't log in

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
for more than 10 days,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
your file will be deleted.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Every hub

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
has its own rules.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
For more details,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
you can refer to their settings.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
If we go back to the Control Panel,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
you will see a Token.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
In the upper left corner,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
there is a Token.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
If you click on it,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
you can see some

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
complicated things.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Most of the things here

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
are used by the administrator.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
However, I want to talk about

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
the things below.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
For example,

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
if you click on the

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
OAuth application,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
JupyterHub

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
is compatible

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
with OAuth.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
This means that

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
according to the administrator's

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
own ideas,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
they can use

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
third-party account information

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
to enter

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
JupyterHub verification.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
For example,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Kalisto Hub

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
uses your Google account

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
or Microsoft account

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
to verify.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
However,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
JupyterHub

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
in our team

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
uses GitHub account

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
to do third-party verification.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
The advantage of doing this is

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
that the administrator

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
can save a lot of time

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
in managing users and their accounts.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Because you are

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
distributing this responsibility

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
to third-party groups.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I personally think it's good

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
because you can imagine

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
that almost every researcher

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
has Google

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
and GitHub.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
If you can use these accounts

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
to log in to GitHub,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
it is very convenient.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
OK.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
That's about it.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
In the same video,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I will also put

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
some screenshots.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Let's take a look.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Notebook Entry,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Web Entry.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
If today

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
JupyterHub is running on a large

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Google cloud

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
or Amazon cloud,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it may provide

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
an option

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
when starting the server.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It may say

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
how many CPUs do you need

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
for this server?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
You can choose

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
to run a large server

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
or a small server.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Kalisto is a free hub,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
so it provides

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
all users

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
with one CPU.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
That is,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
you can only use one CPU

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
to do things.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
This screenshot is

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
taken from my research hub.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
You can see that

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
we can open up to 64 CPUs.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
In fact, there are 64 CPUs

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
plus GPU options.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It's more luxurious.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
The other screenshot

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
is only

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
seen by the manager of the hub.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You can see

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
some

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
If you are a manager,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
you can see

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
how many people are using this hub,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
who are using it,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
and who haven't used it for a long time.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
You can

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
stop it.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
If you find any abnormal usage,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
you can turn off their hub.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Then they can't continue to use it.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Something like that.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Let's take a look at

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
the manager's interface.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
There is a problem here.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It's almost an hour,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
so I want to stop

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
to see if there are any questions.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I have a question.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
If Kalisto

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
is a user,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
how should you use it?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Good question.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
If we go back to the hub,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
you can see

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
in the Getting Started

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
notebook, there are some links.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You can click on these links.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
For example,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
you can click on

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Kalisto Jupyter and Python Basics Notebook

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
in Preparation.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Then

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
this hub will start

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
retrieving the resources

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
stored on GitHub.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Then copy a copy to the hub.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
After they are done,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
your hub space

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
will have more resources.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
These resources

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
are the resources you can use to learn.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
It's out.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
This is the new notebook I just retrieved.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
This notebook teaches you

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Python.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
There is a YouTube video

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
here.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
You can watch it.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
You can watch it like this.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
There are some other things

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
at the bottom.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
You can add text statements

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
and run these programs.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Let's see what happens next.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Oh, there is a video.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I'd like to watch it, but I'll watch it another day.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
So it's like a teaching hub.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
It's a teaching hub.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
There are various teaching websites.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Yes, it's a teaching hub.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
If we go back to the

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
previous lab interface,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
you can see

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
if you click on Reorganize,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
you can see

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
a new folder.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
If you click on it,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
you can see a lot of things in it.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
This is what you just downloaded.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
In addition to the previous notebook,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
there are many other notebooks

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
that you can refer to.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
In short,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
it's a large-scale resource

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
that is provided to

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
elementary and junior high school teachers

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
for their use of data science.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
You can see

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
what modules have been created.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
In addition to using this method to browse,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Calista also provides resources.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
There should be another Calista Learning Module.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
If you click on it,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you will be connected to another page of Calista.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
There are a lot of learning modules at the bottom.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So if you are a teacher today,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
you can say,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
which module do you want your students to learn today?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Just click on it.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Then the content of the module will be directly

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
retrieved to JupyterHub.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Or you can ask your students to click on it themselves.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Students can use their account

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
to directly execute

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
what's on it.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
There are many other resources here.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
One of my favorite resources

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
is that they have

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the content of

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
cooperating with indigenous people in North America.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
For example,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
if you click on it,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
there is a trap.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
You can use data analysis

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
to see

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
which side of the trap

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
is the best for catching fish.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
It is a learning module,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
so when you click on it,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
it will be retrieved to your hub.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Then you can start

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
doing these interesting data analysis.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Oh, I'm done.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Okay, it's here.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Then you can see

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
what's here. Let's try it.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Oh,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
there is a map.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
This is an interactive map.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
You can drag and drop here.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
This is

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
a fishing ground near Vancouver.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
And so on.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
So Callisto

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
provides a lot of teaching resources

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
to help you familiarize yourself

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
with data science.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Of course, for you,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
there is JupyterHub.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
It looks cool.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
These data

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
are all

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
going through

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Callisto.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Is it an organization?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Do they need to be certified?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
How do you decide

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
whether or not to upload these data?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Callisto is a kind of project.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
It is a project of cooperation between two organizations.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Two

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
non-profit organizations, NPO.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
It is a cooperation project.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
These two organizations

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
have a team

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
to maintain Callisto.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
All the modules

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
are written by them.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
But the data they use

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
should be from somewhere else.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
For example, the fishing data

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
is from the local

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
tribe.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Then it is imported.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
In addition,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
there are also a lot of public data on science.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
They should use those public data

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
to show

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
how data science works.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I see.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Thank you.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Actually, there is one last part.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
If you are satisfied,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
we can stop here.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's okay.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
We can continue.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Really?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
If you

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
think it's okay,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I will talk about the rest of the video.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
The last part

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
is

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
to provide you with more resources.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
In addition to

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Callisto Hub,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
there are many

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
other Hubs.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
For example, a commonly used Hub service

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
is Binder.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Binder

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
is used to

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
turn a GitHub

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
storage into

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
a Hub that can be executed

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
immediately.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
For example,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
this is an article I posted

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
last year.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Its

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
supplementary information

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
is

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
a

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
GitHub page.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
You can find a link

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
on this GitHub page.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Let me see if I can

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
switch to that page.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
this GitHub page

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
is the supplementary information

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
of the article I just posted.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There will be a link

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
to Binder below.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
If you click on it,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
you can start something called Binder.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It will take you to a place

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
similar to Jupyter

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
on the GitHub page.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You can

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
review the information

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
in this article,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and then

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
re-create

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
each image in this article.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
There are

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
many details to explain.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
This is Binder,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
another service provided by GitHub.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
It looks like this.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
This is

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
related to earth science.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It's called Pangeo Cloud.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It's kind of

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
semi-public.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
As long as you are doing earth science,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
you can use their service.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
After registration

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and review,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
you can start using their

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
JupyterHub deployed on

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Google Cloud and Amazon.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You can directly save

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
cloud computing resources

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
on JupyterHub.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's cool.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Of course, there is Callisto.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We won't talk about it.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
If you think

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Callisto Learning Module

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
is a bit complicated,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
or you want a quick

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
learning resource we recommend,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
there are two.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
You can refer to them.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
You can directly

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
go to the hub

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and enter the terminal,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
or you can enter any of them.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You can enter any of them.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
These two are actually

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
the storage on GitHub.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
You can put all the

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
content on the hub.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
For example,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
let's use League

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
as a reference.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Copy and go back to the hub.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Open the terminal.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Paste it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
After you paste it,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
you can see

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
a demo JupyterGit

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
in the main folder.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
There are a lot of things

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
when you click on it.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Let's take a look.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
There is an ip1v here.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
This is an iPython notebook

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
that can be executed.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Other notebooks should be

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
in the folder,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
such as intro Jupyter.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
You can see all kinds of

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
introduction to Jupyter tools.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
In short,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
there are a lot of learning resources here.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You are welcome to

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
try it out

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
at any time.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
In the last two or three videos,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I want to briefly explain

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
that if you really

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
like JupyterHub,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and you want to

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
install JupyterHub for your

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
research team,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
what should you do?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
First of all,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
JupyterHub provides

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
two standard versions.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
One is called The Littlest JupyterHub.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
This version

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
is specifically for

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
small teams,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
between 0 to 100 people.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
In short,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
it is simplified.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You don't have to spend

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
a lot of effort.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You can install it on your

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
lab server

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
for your colleagues or students.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
The other version is

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
JupyterHub on Kubernetes.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
This version

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
is specifically for

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
large cloud

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
installations.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
For example,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
JupyterHub installation

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
on Amazon

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
or Microsoft Azure.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
This version is for

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
hundreds or thousands of people,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
or JupyterHub installation

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
on a supercomputer.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
If you want to install it,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
choose one

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
that suits you.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Even so,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you may still feel

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
that the technical performance

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
is too high.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
After all,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
most people are not

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
good at it.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Of course, we also see this difficulty.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
In 2019,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
some of us

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
in the Jupyter team

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
at Berkeley

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
established a non-profit organization

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
called 2I2C,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
or the International Interactive

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Computing Collaboration.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The purpose of

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
this non-profit organization

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
is to provide

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
various open science

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and technology services.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
One of the most

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
developed services

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is to provide

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
research teams or organizations

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
to install and manage

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
their JupyterHub.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Most of their

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
funding comes from

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
the John Zuckerberg

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Initiative,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
the one on Facebook.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
However,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
they also receive

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
funding from

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
the International Interactive

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Computing Collaboration.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
The Callisto

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and Pangeo

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
hubs we just saw

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
were set up

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
by 2I2C.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
However,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Binder and our own

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
research hub are not.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Our own research hub

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
is more gorgeous

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
because we have to test

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
a lot of things.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Our hub looks like this.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Let me show you.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It should be here.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I don't think I can start.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Looks like I have to wait.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I'll come back later.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
So,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
what we want to achieve

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
through 2I2C

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
is that

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
one day in the future,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
as a researcher,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
all your research activities

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and academic activities

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
can take place on the cloud.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Your own research team

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
will collaborate on the cloud.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
You have to save

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
HPC computing resources

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
and use JupyterHub

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
to log in.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The school itself

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
may have a JupyterHub.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
When you have a lecture

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
or a lecture,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
you can use their hub

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
to give others

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
what you want

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
them to learn.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Even if you attend

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
an international conference,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
this conference

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
may have a hub

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
for the participants

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
to log in

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
and learn new skills

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
through the hub.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
That's about it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Finally, I want to say

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
that all the progress of open science

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
is not done by ourselves.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
There are many

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
community members.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
For example,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
what I can share with you today

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
is a tribute to

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
our entire research team

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
at Berkeley,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
JupyterMeteors.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I put all their people here

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
and let you know

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
what the JupyterMeteors

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
project is doing.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Thank you very much.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
If you have any questions,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
you can contact me

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
by text message

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
or via ZXL.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You can contact me anytime.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
This is my last video.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Thank you.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Thank you, Huaijie.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
If you are interested,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
you can turn on the microphone

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and give Huaijie a round of applause.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Let me

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
find the

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
POAP code.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Let me find it.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
If you have any questions,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
you can ask now.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Thank you for your applause.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Thank you for your applause.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Let me write down

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
the POAP code.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Thank you for your participation.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Thank you.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I have a question.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
For your first video,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
do you want to

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
share it on

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Tyra's website?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Otherwise,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
your sharing

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
should be only temporary.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Let me think about it.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I can share it

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
to the participants.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Absolutely no problem.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
This video will be released soon.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
But I don't know if I can share it on the website.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I will contact you later.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
No problem.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Also,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I have a question.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Many

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
quantum computing

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
companies

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
do similar things,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
such as

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
sharing their

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
computing resources

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
on the cloud.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Do you

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
write the code

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
on Python

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and upload it to their server?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
They will run the code for you.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Their hardware is different,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
but they will run the code for you.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Actually, this is a more traditional way.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
A more traditional way

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
to use a supercomputer

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
is that there is

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
something like a work processor.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You have to

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
upload your

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
code to the

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
work processor.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
The work processor

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
will deploy

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
and decide

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
how many computing resources

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
to run your code

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
at what time.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Finally,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
the result will be packed

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and sent to you.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
This is a more

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
traditional way.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The way we promote now is

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
to save

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
the part of the work processor.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
JupyterHub itself can be used as a work processor.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
As long as you use the right

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
structure, such as Kubernetes,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
the actual

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
technical details are a bit complicated.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I will make it simple.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
As long as you use

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
the structure of Kubernetes,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you can

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
use JupyterHub

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
as a scheduler.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
As a work processor,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
you can decide

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
how many resources

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
you want to use

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
at the beginning of your script.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You can use several nodes,

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
several clusters,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and then you start running.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
JupyterHub

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
and Dask,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Dask is a suite of parallel algorithms

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I just mentioned,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
with Dask's

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
external components.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
As long as you use Dask,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
you can

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
open a few

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
control panels

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
in JupyterHub

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
to monitor

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
how many CPUs

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
you use

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
when running

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
these program codes

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
in real time.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
If you have questions,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
you can ask me

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
in the chat room.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Thanks for watching.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
It seems that

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
the gun has disappeared.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
It's okay. Let's wait for it.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
If you have questions,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
you can ask me

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
in the chat room.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
If you have questions,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
you can ask me

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
in the chat room.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Thanks for watching.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Thanks for watching.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Thanks for watching.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
