0	10000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on July 23, 2022.
10000	18000	Today's speech is given by Yan Ziqi.
18000	26000	The title of his speech is
26000	33000	Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra
33000	43000	Ziqi is a doctoral candidate from the Department of Computer Science at Colorado University.
43000	58000	He is interested in complex systems and the relationship between data, models, and algorithms.
58000	68000	He gave a speech at Taira two years ago.
68000	74000	Please welcome Yan Ziqi.
74000	77000	Hello everyone.
77000	87000	Thank you Jason for the introduction and thank you Taira for designing this platform for us to share our research.
87000	97000	I'll share my screen now.
97000	101000	I'll start.
101000	106000	My topic is Analyzing Data from the Internet with a Single-Page Algebra.
106000	115000	This network is not the Internet. It's a network with many nodes.
115000	122000	There is an interaction between the nodes.
122000	127000	It's called a network in English.
127000	135000	The main content comes from a paper I wrote last year.
135000	142000	I spent a lot of time listing all the references in this slide.
142000	151000	Can you see my mouse?
151000	152000	Yes.
152000	156000	You can download my slides here.
156000	161000	If you see this speech on YouTube, please go to my personal website.
161000	165000	This link will not exist in the future.
165000	167000	There are some things I need to update.
167000	173000	But all the references in this slide have a button.
173000	181000	You can click to see which paper I refer to.
181000	186000	So what is data analysis on the Internet?
186000	191000	This field often asks questions from data.
191000	194000	Data in a complex system.
194000	197000	Data can be, for example, brain science data.
197000	200000	For example, we do brain imaging.
200000	202000	There may be some brain areas in the brain.
202000	206000	We treat the brain area as a node.
206000	209000	There may be some nodes.
209000	212000	Different brain areas will light up at the same time.
212000	214000	It works at the same time.
214000	215000	We can connect it.
215000	218000	This is a network.
218000	222000	We can ask some questions above.
222000	229000	For example, the structure of the brain area under different nodes.
229000	234000	What is the difference in the structure of the brain area?
235000	239000	For example, the ecological system.
239000	242000	We can imagine that if we put each creature.
242000	245000	Between creatures, who eats who?
245000	246000	Then there is a food chain.
246000	248000	This is also a network.
248000	250000	The chain is a tree.
250000	253000	But if it's a network, it's a food network.
253000	260000	Other types, like what we usually see on the Internet.
260000	263000	There is a network between different web pages.
263000	267000	Then we travel, we go to different places.
267000	268000	It also forms a network.
268000	271000	Or a network between people.
271000	279000	This article is an explanation.
279000	286000	How to choose the right model when describing these complex systems.
286000	288000	Because some functions.
288000	291000	Some functions may be between two.
292000	294000	Like a graph in math.
294000	295000	Like this.
295000	298000	Between one point and another point, there are two functions.
298000	302000	But sometimes, for example, we just said that the example of the brain area.
302000	303000	We have a stimulus.
303000	307000	There may be three different areas of the brain area that light up at the same time.
307000	310000	At this time, we have three points that work for each other.
310000	313000	These things may be more suitable.
313000	318000	Described by the so-called Higher-Order Network Analysis.
319000	323000	So, uh, this article talks about some, uh, different, uh, data.
323000	327000	How could there be some higher-order things in it?
327000	331000	And then, uh, uh, what model to choose, and so on.
331000	340000	So, uh, my report today will focus on, uh, this single-body review.
340000	344000	It's called Symbiotic Complex.
345000	349000	Right, and if there's any questions, you can interrupt me.
349000	355000	Okay, and I don't know what you think of when you hear Network Science.
355000	358000	And then, um, this is a recently published book.
358000	362000	And then, uh, the last chapter talks about, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.
362000	366000	Talk about, uh, how to look forward in network science, and so on.
366000	370000	And then he sorted out some different areas of the last 20 years.
370000	374000	Um, this is the field of paper, and then the number of them.
374000	378000	And then we can see, for example, uh, about infectious diseases.
378000	381000	Infectious diseases are, of course, a thing that has to do with the Internet.
381000	385000	There's a lot of that in the last year or two.
385000	390000	So, um, um, what I'm going to talk about today is more on this high-level Internet.
390000	395000	It's Hypergraph or, uh, Symbiotic Complex.
395000	401000	Um, there's been a lot of that recently, but not as much as, uh, uh, Epidemic.
401000	404000	So, um, there's a lot of the same kind of numbers.
404000	407000	So, um, if you're interested, you can look it up.
407000	411000	And then, uh, I'm with, uh, uh, Li Zhengde from the University of Chenggong.
411000	413000	The teacher also translated a small book.
413000	415000	And then this is also a link that you can click on.
415000	418000	You can, uh, it's Chinese, and then there's a lot of examples.
418000	421000	You can click on it.
421000	426000	So, um, before I start this talk, I want to thank my instructors.
426000	429000	I have two instructors, Josh and Dan.
429000	432000	And then they, um, I'm from Computer Science.
432000	438000	And then, but they, uh, they have a strategy in math and biology.
438000	445000	So, um, I'd like to thank the authors of this paper.
445000	448000	Especially, uh, Ronga and Aleche.
448000	451000	Because, uh, I was communicating with the two of them.
451000	454000	And then I found out that, uh, they did this article.
454000	456000	There's a, there's an open problem.
456000	461000	And then, um, um, so I started doing this open problem.
461000	464000	Okay.
464000	469000	So, um, now we're going to talk about what I just said.
469000	474000	There are some, uh, uh, ways to describe a complex system.
475000	479000	And then I try to list, I try to divide it into three types.
479000	482000	Uh, graph, or this.
482000	485000	Hypergraph, or this.
485000	488000	That's it.
488000	492000	Um, these three things are actually a, uh, a model choice.
492000	494000	That is, what data do you see?
494000	497000	You can choose which model you want to use.
497000	498000	And then you use that model.
498000	501000	Maybe you get the benefits of using that model.
501000	504000	But maybe you lose some of the other properties.
504000	508000	So, uh, uh, uh, this is a very good paper.
508000	511000	Uh, it should be used.
511000	514000	Uh, what kind of data should be used at what time?
514000	518000	So, uh, let's say, uh, I see a data today.
518000	523000	Um, it's the data from the author and their paper.
523000	524000	So that's actually what it is.
524000	527000	Which papers were issued by which authors?
527000	529000	Well, what about this data?
529000	532000	Um, his, uh, input is, is determined.
532000	539000	That is, um, um, I know which authors I have in my data.
539000	543000	But, uh, because I want to ask different questions.
543000	548000	I can have different, uh, data, uh, data representation.
548000	551000	For example, I can ask, uh, these two authors.
551000	554000	Have you ever written a paper together?
554000	556000	So this is you choose two people.
556000	557000	And then they have written a paper.
557000	559000	Then you put it together.
559000	561000	At that time, you will get this data.
561000	564000	You can see if 1 and 2 have written a paper.
564000	565000	And then there's writing on it.
565000	567000	2 and 4 have written a paper.
567000	568000	And then there's a lot here.
568000	571000	For example, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3 also have.
571000	574000	1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 3, and then 3 and 4.
574000	575000	That's it.
575000	579000	That kind of data is a, uh, a graph.
579000	581000	This is a graph.
581000	584000	Then, um, you can ask a little more detail.
584000	590000	For example, you say, do these people have, um, is to write a paper.
590000	595000	So, at this time, there's something called HyperEdge.
595000	597000	The extension of Edge is called HyperEdge.
597000	600000	Because in Edge, you have to choose two points.
600000	603000	But in HyperEdge, you can choose n points.
603000	605000	At this time, you choose.
605000	606000	In fact, it is four pieces of paper.
606000	607000	You choose four.
608000	610000	1, 2, 2, 4, and then 1, 2, 3.
610000	613000	Because now it's, uh, HyperGraph.
613000	615000	So you can choose to come in.
615000	616000	That's it.
616000	619000	Then there's a HyperGraph at this time.
619000	626000	Then, um, you can also use Simplicial Complex to describe.
626000	628000	Um, this Simplicial Complex to describe.
628000	631000	He's asking, uh, um.
631000	633000	It's a little, a little rough.
633000	637000	So, um, uh, these people have written a piece of paper.
637000	639000	So, at this time, he's actually like HyperGraph.
639000	641000	He just chose n people up.
641000	644000	And then it's called a Simplex.
644000	648000	But this Simplicial Complex has a definition in math.
648000	651000	It's defined as, um, you.
651000	654000	After choosing a Simplex.
654000	660000	You're going to put all the smaller, um, all the smaller Simplexes.
660000	664000	All the Simplexes are included in this, this Simplicial Complex.
664000	668000	For example, an example is if I choose 1, 2, 3.
668000	673000	For example, 1, 2, 3, this, this, um.
673000	674000	Everyone writes paper.
674000	677000	This thing is a, uh, a Simplex.
677000	679000	That's in this data.
679000	683000	I have to include 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 3.
683000	685000	Mathematically, it's like this.
685000	688000	So, uh, if we have this data.
688000	692000	In fact, it's in this Simplicial Complex.
692000	695000	It's going to be so many, so many.
695000	698000	All the possible things are in it.
698000	705000	2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, and then 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.
705000	709000	It looks like a very, very.
709000	712000	It's a big construct.
712000	715000	And then, uh, it's because of his definition.
715000	719000	That is, all the smaller subsets must be included in it.
719000	722000	That, uh, that's because of that.
722000	725000	We can use the biggest Simplex.
725000	728000	And then we call it Facets.
728000	732000	To represent a Simplicial Complex.
732000	733000	What does that mean?
733000	734000	For example, we see this now.
734000	737000	It looks like a lot of this data.
737000	739000	Then we can choose 1, 2, 3.
739000	741000	Because 1, 2, 3 looks big.
741000	743000	After you choose 1, 2, 3.
743000	746000	It automatically includes 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.
746000	748000	So, in fact, there are some people who can.
748000	751000	Uh, don't, don't choose it.
751000	754000	Then 2, 4 will be less than 10 and 30.
754000	757000	So, in fact, if, uh, this data.
757000	760000	If you want to use Simplicial Complex to express it.
760000	763000	You just need to say these three.
763000	766000	Uh, these three Facets are fine.
766000	770000	That, uh, so this time I'll get one like this.
770000	773000	One, one expression like this.
773000	776000	That's what I'm talking about today.
776000	778000	This work is more related.
778000	780000	There are some other, uh.
780000	783000	The term is called, uh.
783000	784000	Degree Sequence.
784000	786000	Or the degree distribution.
786000	788000	Then, or, Size Sequence.
788000	790000	Uh, Size Distribution.
790000	792000	I don't know what to do.
792000	794000	I think I'll use Side Sequence.
794000	796000	Um, what does that mean?
796000	798000	Um, Degree Sequence is, uh.
798000	800000	If we look at the example of the picture,
800000	802000	Degree Sequence is, uh.
802000	804000	How many neighbors does each point connect to?
804000	806000	For example, this point is connected to 2.
806000	808000	And then this point is connected to three neighbors.
808000	810000	So this 3, 2.
810000	811000	3, 2.
811000	813000	These four numbers make up.
813000	816000	The Degree Sequence of this picture.
816000	818000	Um, this sequence is not important.
818000	820000	Because it's a distribution.
820000	822000	That, but, uh.
822000	824000	This thing, if it's in this.
824000	826000	In the world of Simplicial Complex.
826000	828000	I'm going to be 1, 2, 2, 2.
828000	830000	The reason is because, uh.
830000	832000	This A1, this author.
832000	834000	He's only connected to one side.
834000	836000	It's 1, 2, 3, this side.
836000	838000	So, uh, he's 1.
838000	840000	It's like a hand sticking out.
840000	842000	And then, like, this A2, this author.
842000	844000	He's connected to this.
844000	846000	This 1, 2, 3, this.
846000	848000	Simplex.
848000	850000	With 2, 4, this Simplex.
850000	852000	So his Degree Sequence is.
852000	854000	Uh, his Degree is 2.
854000	856000	The above is the definition.
856000	858000	It's about this.
858000	860000	Um, how to say it on a Simplicial Complex.
860000	862000	His Degree.
862000	864000	What is the sequence definition?
864000	866000	That, uh, related.
866000	868000	There is also a word called Side Sequence.
870000	872000	Um, that is to say.
872000	874000	Every side of it.
874000	876000	That is, every interaction of it.
876000	878000	What is its size?
878000	880000	Uh, actually, I should list it here.
880000	882000	Um, because this is a picture.
882000	884000	This picture, every picture is.
884000	886000	Uh, his Interaction.
886000	888000	It's made up of two.
888000	890000	So this picture is a few sides.
890000	892000	There are a few 2s.
892000	894000	For example, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is 5.
894000	896000	5 2s make up this Side Sequence.
896000	898000	That's it.
898000	900000	If it's Hypergraph, it's 3.
900000	902000	Because there's a 1, 2, 3.
902000	904000	Interaction.
904000	906000	3, 2, 2, 2.
906000	908000	Uh, Simplicial Complex.
908000	910000	Because I have three now.
910000	912000	So it's 3, 2, 2.
914000	916000	Okay, um.
916000	918000	Is there a problem with the current definition?
924000	926000	Okay, um.
926000	928000	I.
928000	930000	I.
930000	932000	The job I'm going to talk about today.
932000	934000	Although I will go through a lot of other related information.
934000	936000	Uh, it's actually like this.
936000	938000	Um, I'm going to.
938000	940000	My job is.
940000	942000	Suppose I was given.
942000	944000	Two groups of Sequence.
944000	946000	One group is.
946000	948000	2, 2, 2, 1.
948000	950000	And then the other group is.
950000	952000	3, 2, 2.
952000	954000	Can I use these two groups?
954000	956000	The sequence of integers.
956000	958000	To find a Simplicial Complex.
958000	960000	Make it.
960000	962000	The degree and.
962000	964000	This.
964000	966000	The order of size is just the two I just gave.
966000	968000	Sequence.
968000	970000	That.
970000	972000	Um.
972000	974000	Not all.
974000	976000	You can.
976000	978000	Find a structure like this.
978000	980000	Can correspond to each other.
980000	982000	Then I'll say I can't find it.
982000	984000	Then if I can find it.
984000	986000	That's good.
986000	988000	I'll say why it's good.
988000	990000	Okay.
990000	992000	That, um.
994000	996000	So we.
996000	998000	Yes, I'm going to enter the next video.
998000	1000000	So now we see this.
1000000	1002000	This Simplicial Complex.
1002000	1004000	Because it.
1004000	1006000	All the little subsets have to be included.
1006000	1008000	It looks like a very complicated thing.
1008000	1010000	But it actually has some benefits.
1010000	1012000	This is my first.
1012000	1014000	Uh, the first interlude is.
1014000	1016000	Um, insert.
1016000	1018000	Let everyone take a break.
1018000	1020000	The second benefit.
1020000	1022000	Because.
1022000	1024000	There is a field called Topological Data Analysis.
1024000	1026000	It can.
1026000	1028000	Use.
1028000	1030000	I include these.
1030000	1032000	Smaller subsets.
1032000	1034000	Then to calculate.
1034000	1036000	Some of the structures of this data.
1036000	1038000	For example, it has.
1038000	1040000	A few holes.
1040000	1042000	Like I'll give you an example in a minute.
1042000	1044000	This.
1044000	1046000	This.
1046000	1048000	The cup actually has a hole.
1048000	1050000	Here.
1050000	1052000	I put a hole in this place.
1052000	1054000	How to get the data.
1054000	1056000	How to define it.
1056000	1058000	How to define.
1058000	1060000	Find a way to describe it.
1060000	1062000	And then describe it.
1062000	1064000	You have to find out how many holes it has.
1064000	1066000	So that we can distinguish these data.
1066000	1068000	What's the difference?
1068000	1070000	For example, like.
1070000	1072000	Um, for example, I know.
1072000	1074000	Um.
1074000	1076000	Um, this is a.
1076000	1078000	This is a paper, and then he is.
1078000	1080000	Um, when the U.S. presidential election.
1080000	1082000	Um, in.
1082000	1084000	Some small bacteria in each state.
1084000	1086000	And then they might.
1086000	1088000	Different bacteria, he might vote red.
1088000	1090000	Or blue.
1090000	1092000	Can I use it?
1092000	1094000	Topology.
1094000	1096000	Find out.
1096000	1098000	Is there any.
1098000	1100000	Special structure is, for example, a blue sea.
1100000	1102000	In fact, there may be some red bacteria.
1102000	1104000	Um, especially like.
1104000	1106000	Vote for the Republican Party.
1106000	1108000	Then, or just analyze this.
1108000	1110000	Um.
1110000	1112000	All the papers that make up this data.
1112000	1114000	What shape is there?
1116000	1118000	Um, yes.
1118000	1120000	Um.
1120000	1122000	If you are interested in this TDA.
1122000	1124000	You can go to this website.
1124000	1126000	He has a lot of.
1126000	1128000	The.
1128000	1130000	Talk is the same as Tyra.
1130000	1132000	Um, invite people to share.
1132000	1134000	After sharing, put it on YouTube.
1134000	1136000	Then you can see all kinds of.
1136000	1138000	Using TDA to study.
1138000	1140000	Some strange data examples.
1140000	1142000	The example I'm talking about here.
1142000	1144000	You can find it in this paper.
1144000	1146000	Reference.
1146000	1148000	Um, other than this.
1148000	1150000	Topology is related to.
1150000	1152000	Um, put.
1152000	1154000	The kind of picture I just said.
1154000	1156000	The phenomenon that happened above.
1156000	1158000	Because of the picture.
1158000	1160000	Um, it's a pairwise.
1160000	1162000	Then extend to.
1162000	1164000	Um.
1164000	1166000	Not just pairwise, but three or four or more.
1166000	1168000	That.
1168000	1170000	Um, he will have some examples.
1170000	1172000	I can't.
1172000	1174000	In a very short time.
1174000	1176000	Finished.
1176000	1178000	That is to say, what interesting examples do they have?
1178000	1180000	But most of the time.
1180000	1182000	Um.
1182000	1184000	In the past, in the world of graph.
1184000	1186000	He will have some dynamical models.
1186000	1188000	For example.
1188000	1190000	For example, there are two agents.
1190000	1192000	When they are together.
1192000	1194000	What kind of interaction?
1194000	1196000	For example.
1196000	1198000	For example, I want to buy a watch.
1198000	1200000	Then, but I'm not sure what brand I want to buy.
1200000	1202000	Then every time I look at my friends.
1202000	1204000	What brand of watch do they wear?
1204000	1206000	Then decide.
1206000	1208000	It's a majority vote.
1208000	1210000	To decide what brand I should buy.
1210000	1212000	This.
1212000	1214000	This is a model.
1214000	1216000	The main.
1216000	1218000	The main component is.
1218000	1220000	Uh, you have to look at your friends.
1220000	1222000	That's the effect between the two.
1222000	1224000	There are a lot of these two.
1224000	1226000	The model of the effect between the two.
1226000	1228000	Extended to.
1228000	1230000	Uh.
1230000	1232000	More than two.
1232000	1234000	The effect.
1234000	1236000	Then there will be some interesting phenomena.
1236000	1238000	So, um, this is.
1238000	1240000	Um, there are some related papers.
1240000	1242000	It's all about this data.
1242000	1244000	Okay.
1244000	1246000	Back to my original topic.
1246000	1248000	I just introduced.
1248000	1250000	I just introduced the degree and size.
1250000	1252000	Sequence.
1252000	1254000	Um, these two things are used to.
1254000	1256000	Describe a.
1256000	1258000	Symbiotic complex structure.
1258000	1260000	So why do we.
1260000	1262000	I'm interested in them.
1262000	1264000	Uh, because these things are.
1264000	1266000	It's all very local.
1266000	1268000	That is.
1268000	1270000	For example, I want to go back.
1270000	1272000	Can I come back here?
1272000	1274000	It's all a local structure.
1278000	1280000	That is.
1280000	1282000	I don't have to know all of me.
1282000	1284000	What does all the data look like?
1284000	1286000	I just need to know.
1286000	1288000	This person has several.
1288000	1290000	Several changes.
1290000	1292000	Or say.
1292000	1294000	A group of three people.
1294000	1296000	This is a local structure.
1296000	1298000	Then, um.
1298000	1300000	We're interested in them.
1300000	1302000	It's because of these local structures.
1302000	1304000	Maybe with them.
1304000	1306000	To do one thing together.
1306000	1308000	There's a relationship.
1308000	1310000	So we want to put them together.
1310000	1312000	Establish a link.
1312000	1314000	That, um.
1314000	1316000	What about this thing?
1316000	1318000	Because I often want to compare.
1318000	1320000	I'm in the world of Symbiotic Complex.
1320000	1322000	Then in the world of graph.
1322000	1324000	Uh, everyone is like this.
1324000	1326000	Asking questions.
1326000	1328000	Um, in the world of graph.
1328000	1330000	There's a model called Configuration Model.
1330000	1332000	What does that mean?
1332000	1334000	Um, I gave you a graph today.
1334000	1336000	Then I know this graph.
1336000	1338000	Inside the degree sequence.
1338000	1340000	It's just telling me.
1340000	1342000	Every point he has a few.
1342000	1344000	A few neighbors.
1344000	1346000	This degree sequence.
1346000	1348000	It's a very local one.
1348000	1350000	That's it.
1350000	1352000	Sometimes, this network, he might have some.
1352000	1354000	He might have some properties.
1354000	1356000	Yes, I'm not sure how special he is.
1356000	1358000	Or is it that he's with this?
1358000	1360000	The local degree has a lot to do with it.
1360000	1362000	So, I can use.
1362000	1364000	Configuration Model.
1364000	1366000	This network.
1366000	1368000	Randomization is randomizing a lot.
1368000	1370000	A lot of different networks.
1370000	1372000	But, uh, I ask for these different networks.
1372000	1374000	Their degree sequence is all with me.
1374000	1376000	The one I observed was the same.
1376000	1378000	Then I'll ask again.
1378000	1380000	Uh, in all the different networks.
1380000	1382000	The nature I care about.
1382000	1384000	The distribution of the data I'm actually observing.
1384000	1386000	Uh, actually observing the data.
1386000	1388000	Is there any difference in this value?
1388000	1390000	What if there's a difference?
1390000	1392000	I think so.
1392000	1394000	Um, this one.
1394000	1396000	The network I observed may be in this degree.
1396000	1398000	Um, there may be some special places.
1398000	1400000	Beyond the degree sequence.
1400000	1402000	Special places.
1402000	1404000	Um, need to be explained.
1404000	1406000	This is an example.
1406000	1408000	It's like this.
1408000	1410000	It is.
1410000	1412000	Um, this is a barn spiral.
1412000	1414000	A bird.
1414000	1416000	And then, um, everyone thinks.
1416000	1418000	The color of it.
1418000	1420000	With it.
1420000	1422000	The ratio of the mating.
1422000	1424000	There is a relationship, but everyone is not sure.
1424000	1426000	What is the relationship?
1426000	1428000	Um, they do experiments.
1428000	1430000	Put this bird on top of the sensor.
1430000	1432000	Then look at the bird in a space.
1432000	1434000	Then fly.
1434000	1436000	If they are close, he will connect a side.
1436000	1438000	Then form a network like this.
1438000	1440000	Well, in this network.
1440000	1442000	They went to say.
1442000	1444000	Because he knows the color of each bird.
1444000	1446000	Then he also knows the different colors.
1446000	1448000	Is there any interaction between them?
1448000	1450000	So they just made this network.
1450000	1452000	They will count them.
1452000	1454000	The one between them.
1454000	1456000	Correlation related to color.
1456000	1458000	Then I got this.
1458000	1460000	This virtual line, this part.
1460000	1462000	At the same time.
1462000	1464000	Um.
1464000	1466000	This piece of paper also took this data.
1466000	1468000	Um, they observed this network.
1468000	1470000	Random.
1470000	1472000	Then every random component.
1472000	1474000	Calculated this once.
1474000	1476000	Pearson Correlation.
1476000	1478000	Then get a distribution.
1478000	1480000	Then so, um.
1480000	1482000	So this one comes from this data.
1482000	1484000	Observed.
1484000	1486000	Then this one comes from this distribution.
1486000	1488000	Um, you are random.
1488000	1490000	Then you will feel.
1490000	1492000	Ah, they actually.
1492000	1494000	Ah, there is no difference.
1494000	1496000	Ah, you won't feel.
1496000	1498000	So it seems to be here.
1498000	1500000	You won't feel that you are.
1500000	1502000	Color Color Correlation.
1502000	1504000	What's special about it?
1504000	1506000	It's more than the degree.
1506000	1508000	Degrees can explain.
1508000	1510000	Corresponding.
1510000	1512000	If I observe another data.
1512000	1514000	He may.
1514000	1516000	Um, his Correlation is very low.
1516000	1518000	For example, if I don't know.
1518000	1520000	Um, if there is another data.
1520000	1522000	Then you observe his color.
1522000	1524000	Then you will ask.
1524000	1526000	Ah, you will feel.
1526000	1528000	Ah, why do I observe the data now?
1528000	1530000	With this one.
1530000	1532000	After this data.
1532000	1534000	His Correlation is particularly low.
1534000	1536000	Then because of this randomization.
1536000	1538000	Is related to the degree.
1538000	1540000	You will know.
1540000	1542000	At this time, there should be some.
1542000	1544000	Is beyond the degree.
1544000	1546000	Things beyond the degree.
1546000	1548000	Plays in this.
1548000	1550000	Then we.
1550000	1552000	Um.
1554000	1556000	Is there a problem so far?
1562000	1564000	Let me ask.
1564000	1566000	I want to understand this example.
1566000	1568000	Um.
1568000	1570000	The picture in the middle.
1570000	1572000	The number on it is.
1574000	1576000	How many lines did he connect?
1576000	1578000	Or what?
1578000	1580000	The number on it should be his.
1580000	1582000	The number of the bird.
1582000	1584000	Oh, the number of the bird.
1584000	1586000	Then.
1586000	1588000	There should be a few times of interaction.
1588000	1590000	OK.
1590000	1592000	Then.
1592000	1594000	The meaning of gray and white.
1594000	1596000	Is their color.
1596000	1598000	Um.
1598000	1600000	OK.
1600000	1602000	Then the picture on the right is.
1604000	1606000	How did it come out?
1606000	1608000	I don't understand. Can you say it again?
1608000	1610000	After we observe this map.
1610000	1612000	Uh.
1612000	1614000	After we observe this map.
1614000	1616000	We also have his color.
1616000	1618000	So we can actually count his.
1618000	1620000	Color color correlation.
1620000	1622000	Then we calculate a number.
1622000	1624000	But I don't know if this number is.
1624000	1626000	Is it special?
1626000	1628000	So.
1628000	1630000	Um.
1630000	1632000	They said.
1632000	1634000	Let me see if I can put this network.
1634000	1636000	I found a lot.
1636000	1638000	Ah.
1638000	1640000	With him.
1640000	1642000	The structure is different.
1642000	1644000	But the degree sequence is the same as other networks.
1644000	1646000	And then on top of it.
1646000	1648000	Calculate his.
1648000	1650000	Correlation.
1650000	1652000	And then we got a distribution.
1652000	1654000	And then we can ask.
1654000	1656000	In the end, I observed this data.
1656000	1658000	Correlation.
1658000	1660000	Is it special?
1660000	1662000	OK.
1662000	1664000	Um.
1664000	1666000	Then is this more special?
1666000	1668000	Is.
1668000	1670000	Ah.
1670000	1672000	It's with me.
1672000	1674000	How do I put this network?
1674000	1676000	It's about randomization.
1676000	1678000	At this time, he fixed his.
1678000	1680000	His degree.
1680000	1682000	Is.
1682000	1684000	Fixed him every.
1684000	1686000	Every bird.
1686000	1688000	In the end, with a few other birds.
1688000	1690000	And then there are a lot of other different structures.
1690000	1692000	And then ask.
1692000	1694000	I observed this.
1694000	1696000	Is it special?
1696000	1698000	So.
1698000	1700000	The middle of this example.
1700000	1702000	Anyway.
1702000	1704000	Doing this thing.
1704000	1706000	But.
1706000	1708000	Your.
1708000	1710000	It means.
1710000	1712000	You have to find.
1712000	1714000	The same degree sequence.
1714000	1716000	This thing.
1716000	1718000	The thing that needs to be studied.
1718000	1720000	Is this the conclusion?
1720000	1722000	Correct.
1722000	1724000	Ah.
1724000	1726000	This paper is.
1726000	1728000	Proposed a configuration model.
1728000	1730000	You can randomize a network.
1730000	1732000	And then he gave an example.
1732000	1734000	Ah.
1734000	1736000	After you can randomize it.
1736000	1738000	Ah.
1738000	1740000	This ensemble can be used to do.
1740000	1742000	Some statistical tests.
1742000	1744000	OK.
1744000	1746000	So, uh.
1746000	1748000	So if you only look at this piece of paper.
1748000	1750000	You might only get a Pearson correlation.
1750000	1752000	And then, but you don't really know.
1752000	1754000	What's so special about him?
1754000	1756000	So, in order to know his special place.
1756000	1758000	I want to put the original data.
1758000	1760000	Ah.
1760000	1762000	Fixed a few parameters.
1762000	1764000	And then make an ensemble.
1764000	1766000	And then let's take a look at this ensemble.
1766000	1768000	All of the.
1768000	1770000	Inside the Pearson correlation.
1770000	1772000	Is not.
1772000	1774000	Ah.
1774000	1776000	In fact, it depends on.
1776000	1778000	I.
1778000	1780000	I suspect he's with.
1780000	1782000	What kind of parameters do I suspect he's related to?
1782000	1784000	For example, now I suspect.
1784000	1786000	This Pearson correlation may be related to.
1786000	1788000	The degree distribution.
1788000	1790000	It may be related to the degree distribution.
1790000	1792000	So I deliberately fixed it.
1792000	1794000	Let's take a look at this distribution.
1794000	1796000	And then see if he's in there or out there.
1796000	1798000	Any other questions?
1798000	1800000	Ah.
1800000	1802000	Then I.
1802000	1804000	Ah.
1804000	1806000	Ah.
1806000	1808000	Ah.
1808000	1810000	Ah.
1810000	1812000	Ah.
1812000	1814000	Ah.
1814000	1816000	Ah.
1816000	1818000	Ah.
1818000	1820000	Ah.
1820000	1822000	Ah.
1822000	1824000	Ah.
1824000	1826000	Well, that's the example of the bird just now.
1826000	1828000	How many other birds do the birds have?
1828000	1830000	Interaction.
1830000	1832000	The Global Gravity of Opportunity.
1832000	1834000	That's a paper by The Biological Science.
1834000	1836000	Its reproduction is likely to be related to the color.
1836000	1838000	This is one.
1838000	1840000	A global.
1840000	1842000	It may be related to a local.
1842000	1844000	An example in a certain data.
1844000	1846000	That ah.
1846000	1848000	Another related question.
1848000	1850000	If I.
1850000	1852000	Only after getting.
1852000	1854000	After the degree sequence.
1854000	1856000	Can I get from it.
1856000	1858000	Generate a network.
1858000	1860000	If I can.
1860000	1862000	In fact, it can also be used to answer a lot of interesting questions.
1862000	1864000	They are on the structure.
1864000	1866000	And in.
1866000	1868000	In.
1868000	1870000	Is dynamic.
1870000	1872000	For example.
1872000	1874000	Ah.
1874000	1876000	Ah.
1876000	1878000	I think this is more.
1878000	1880000	Domain specific.
1880000	1882000	I'm going to click on it again.
1882000	1884000	This.
1884000	1886000	This link.
1886000	1888000	But here.
1888000	1890000	What I want to say is.
1890000	1892000	Well.
1892000	1894000	Ah.
1894000	1896000	Everyone will doubt that a.
1896000	1898000	Everyone will doubt that.
1898000	1900000	Can I.
1900000	1902000	From a local information.
1902000	1904000	And this structure.
1904000	1906000	Is there anything special about it?
1906000	1908000	If you can't generate it.
1908000	1910000	If I get a degree sequence.
1910000	1912000	I don't know how to generate a network.
1912000	1914000	Then you can't talk about it at all.
1914000	1916000	On this network.
1916000	1918000	What kind of structure is special.
1918000	1920000	So being able to build this link is an important thing.
1920000	1922000	Then this is the structure.
1922000	1924000	Then the second dynamic.
1924000	1926000	What does it mean?
1926000	1928000	Ah.
1928000	1930000	Take that.
1930000	1932000	I'm not an infectious disease expert.
1932000	1934000	But in terms of infectious disease cases.
1934000	1936000	Ah.
1936000	1938000	Because we know that infectious diseases sometimes spread very quickly.
1938000	1940000	It's because some people may.
1940000	1942000	Ah.
1942000	1944000	There is a chance in everyday life.
1944000	1946000	Hundreds of people.
1946000	1948000	But this is not our normal life.
1948000	1950000	But in the data of this human network.
1950000	1952000	There are specific people.
1952000	1954000	His degree is very large.
1954000	1956000	That.
1956000	1958000	That.
1960000	1962000	In such a data.
1962000	1964000	In such a structure.
1964000	1966000	We have to be able to generate this structure.
1966000	1968000	To answer this question.
1968000	1970000	So we.
1970000	1972000	There will be a model.
1972000	1974000	Say it.
1974000	1976000	If I want to generate a network.
1976000	1978000	Then this network.
1978000	1980000	The distribution of the degree is very heavy.
1980000	1982000	That is.
1982000	1984000	You look at his.
1984000	1986000	You draw a distribution.
1986000	1988000	Ah.
1988000	1990000	There are only a few friends in life.
1990000	1992000	Then there are a few people with two friends.
1992000	1994000	There are thousands of friends in life.
1994000	1996000	This is a degree distribution.
1996000	1998000	That.
1998000	2000000	You have to generate a structure from this distribution.
2000000	2002000	Then you can be on top of that structure.
2002000	2004000	Run the model of infectious diseases on that structure.
2004000	2006000	That's why.
2006000	2008000	Be able to have a way.
2008000	2010000	From local information to generate a structure.
2010000	2012000	It is also important because.
2012000	2014000	Ah.
2014000	2016000	In this way, you can do some experiments.
2016000	2018000	Ah.
2018000	2020000	So this is what I provide.
2020000	2022000	About what I'm going to do.
2022000	2024000	That.
2024000	2026000	Ah.
2026000	2028000	Go deeper into the topic.
2028000	2030000	Ah.
2030000	2032000	Ah, we just talked about this.
2032000	2034000	The local thing is the degree.
2034000	2036000	Then we have.
2036000	2038000	Observe some data.
2038000	2040000	Usually, after you observe the data.
2040000	2042000	Ah, you have to get the degree.
2042000	2044000	It's very simple.
2044000	2046000	For example, you know you.
2046000	2048000	You have a class.
2048000	2050000	Then you go to ask everyone he has.
2050000	2052000	You think in this class.
2052000	2054000	What kind of people are his friends?
2054000	2056000	Then you will get one.
2056000	2058000	The network of friends in this class.
2058000	2060000	Then you have to go from this network of friends to get it.
2060000	2062000	His degree is actually very simple.
2062000	2064000	Just take everyone.
2064000	2066000	And then see how many friends he has around him.
2066000	2068000	That's it.
2068000	2070000	This direction is usually simpler.
2070000	2072000	That.
2072000	2074000	But it's more difficult.
2074000	2076000	How do you.
2076000	2078000	Every friend, for example, this class has 30 people.
2078000	2080000	Then you give me one.
2080000	2082000	Ah, you give me 30 numbers greater than 0.
2082000	2084000	Then you can not create a network.
2084000	2086000	This is more difficult to ask.
2086000	2088000	That.
2088000	2090000	Correspondence is.
2090000	2092000	If you want to get this network.
2092000	2094000	You have to randomize it.
2094000	2096000	Find an ensemble.
2096000	2098000	So that every network in this ensemble.
2098000	2100000	He has the same.
2100000	2102000	Degree sequence.
2102000	2104000	This thing is also a difficult thing.
2104000	2106000	That.
2106000	2108000	What I listed is everyone's work.
2108000	2110000	Then you can click to see.
2110000	2112000	That's a little closer.
2112000	2114000	That is.
2114000	2116000	You get a simple complex.
2116000	2118000	How to randomize it.
2118000	2120000	So that every one in this randomization.
2120000	2122000	Ah, every one.
2122000	2124000	Simple complex.
2124000	2126000	They all have the same.
2126000	2128000	Degree and size sequence.
2128000	2130000	That this.
2130000	2132000	Ypvp17.
2132000	2134000	Ah, just now.
2134000	2136000	Ah, the one that inspired me.
2136000	2138000	That.
2138000	2140000	Why is this a problem?
2140000	2142000	Ah, the same thing is in the hypergraph.
2142000	2144000	That's how it appears.
2144000	2146000	Why?
2146000	2148000	Why would I do this job?
2148000	2150000	The reason is because.
2150000	2152000	They are in this paper.
2152000	2154000	They proposed a.
2154000	2156000	Randomize a structure.
2156000	2158000	Then they go.
2158000	2160000	Explain that they are like this.
2160000	2162000	Can.
2162000	2164000	Can.
2164000	2166000	Explore.
2166000	2168000	All possible space.
2168000	2170000	He has some mathematical arguments in it.
2170000	2172000	But.
2172000	2174000	What about this method? He has to have one.
2174000	2176000	A data is there.
2176000	2178000	Then you can put that data.
2178000	2180000	That's it.
2180000	2182000	But he can't answer.
2182000	2184000	Some questions like today.
2184000	2186000	I want to have one.
2186000	2188000	Theoretical.
2188000	2190000	Ah.
2190000	2192000	Degree and size sequence.
2192000	2194000	Ah, I want to know.
2194000	2196000	For example, my degree and size sequence.
2196000	2198000	They are all the ones I just said.
2198000	2200000	That kind of structure.
2200000	2202000	Can I use it?
2202000	2204000	To generate a.
2204000	2206000	A data.
2206000	2208000	And then randomize it.
2208000	2210000	If there is no.
2210000	2212000	It's not easy for me to do it.
2212000	2214000	They can only go.
2214000	2216000	Ah.
2216000	2218000	This.
2218000	2220000	To find a data.
2220000	2222000	And then randomize it.
2222000	2224000	So, my job is a.
2224000	2226000	A work.
2228000	2230000	I want to ask a question.
2232000	2234000	I still don't quite understand.
2234000	2236000	Ah.
2238000	2240000	Randomization and this one.
2240000	2242000	Find one.
2242000	2244000	One.
2244000	2246000	But the first question is.
2246000	2248000	You have a.
2248000	2250000	A degree sequence.
2250000	2252000	Then can you find a picture.
2252000	2254000	Ah.
2254000	2256000	This degree sequence.
2256000	2258000	Is this the place where you draw the green line?
2258000	2260000	Is it?
2260000	2262000	If it's just a picture, it should be this place.
2262000	2264000	Oh, sorry.
2264000	2266000	Find a.
2266000	2268000	Complex data.
2268000	2270000	If it's a complex data.
2270000	2272000	That's where I'm green.
2272000	2274000	You just need to find one?
2274000	2276000	Or you just.
2276000	2278000	You just need to find one.
2278000	2280000	The reason is that after I found this.
2280000	2282000	I can use the method here to randomize it.
2282000	2284000	It's useful in statistics.
2284000	2286000	OK.
2286000	2288000	But what's the difference between randomization and this thing?
2288000	2290000	My understanding is.
2290000	2292000	Randomization, you don't have to.
2292000	2294000	From.
2294000	2296000	You give a.
2296000	2298000	Then you already know the degree.
2298000	2300000	Degree sequence.
2300000	2302000	You are from degree sequence to.
2302000	2304000	Randomization.
2304000	2306000	You have to find.
2306000	2308000	You have to find a lot of pictures.
2310000	2312000	Is that what it means?
2312000	2314000	Ah.
2314000	2316000	If it's.
2316000	2318000	These random algorithms.
2318000	2320000	If it can be used, it must have a structure.
2320000	2322000	If you only give me.
2322000	2324000	Two integer series.
2324000	2326000	I can't go.
2326000	2328000	For example, to swap his.
2328000	2330000	His side.
2330000	2332000	Then to change his structure.
2332000	2334000	So this randomization process is.
2334000	2336000	You have to give a structure first.
2336000	2338000	Then he might do some swap.
2338000	2340000	What is it?
2340000	2342000	Turn it into.
2342000	2344000	The same degree picture.
2344000	2346000	The so-called structure is.
2346000	2348000	Like.
2348000	2350000	Like this kind of thing.
2350000	2352000	I have to give me a structure first.
2352000	2354000	Then I can use.
2354000	2356000	Random algorithm.
2356000	2358000	Usually related to.
2358000	2360000	Swap side.
2360000	2362000	For example, swap two sides.
2362000	2364000	Swap at the same time.
2364000	2366000	Keep their degree unchanged.
2366000	2368000	But if you don't.
2368000	2370000	If you don't have such a structure.
2370000	2372000	You can't do it.
2372000	2374000	These things here.
2374000	2376000	So the green line is equal to.
2376000	2378000	I'm going to find the first one.
2378000	2380000	Then we can start randomization.
2380000	2382000	OK.
2382000	2384000	Thank you.
2384000	2386000	That's great.
2386000	2388000	I don't think I have enough time.
2388000	2390000	I'm going to talk faster.
2390000	2392000	But I might skip some slides.
2392000	2394000	I still hope I can.
2394000	2396000	I'll be done in about an hour.
2396000	2398000	To do this thing.
2398000	2400000	In fact, I didn't.
2400000	2402000	Solve all the problems.
2402000	2404000	The reason is because.
2404000	2406000	What about this question?
2406000	2408000	He was proven to be a.
2408000	2410000	NP complete question.
2410000	2412000	And then if you're doing research.
2412000	2414000	I usually tell you.
2414000	2416000	You can't actually find one.
2416000	2418000	The algorithm is.
2418000	2420000	It can be completely.
2420000	2422000	Effective and useful.
2422000	2424000	That's a shame.
2424000	2426000	But at that time.
2426000	2428000	I thought it was interesting.
2428000	2430000	Oh, by the way.
2430000	2432000	That's the thing.
2432000	2434000	Test two integer series.
2434000	2436000	Can you find one?
2436000	2438000	This thing should be.
2438000	2440000	A difficult problem.
2440000	2442000	I think the interesting thing is.
2442000	2444000	I was really going to draw a picture.
2444000	2446000	It's like doing that reading.
2446000	2448000	That's it.
2448000	2450000	In the end, I used Excel to do research.
2450000	2452000	That's it.
2452000	2454000	This is the problem.
2454000	2456000	For example, I give two integer series.
2456000	2458000	One is 43321.
2458000	2460000	This is his.
2460000	2462000	The series of degrees is here.
2462000	2464000	And then I give another integer series.
2464000	2466000	It's called his size series.
2466000	2468000	It's called 33333.
2468000	2470000	Well, my goal is.
2470000	2472000	In this array.
2472000	2474000	Fill in 0 or 1.
2474000	2476000	So that his.
2476000	2478000	Every column is just right.
2478000	2480000	It's 4.
2480000	2482000	This is just 3.
2482000	2484000	Every row is just right.
2484000	2486000	It's 3.
2488000	2490000	In addition to this, there is another one.
2490000	2492000	Make this a problem.
2492000	2494000	One of the difficult conditions.
2494000	2496000	It's a difficult limitation.
2496000	2498000	It's two.
2498000	2500000	They can't.
2500000	2502000	Can't.
2502000	2504000	One of them is another.
2504000	2506000	This thing.
2506000	2508000	This is from what I just said.
2508000	2510000	Simple complex definition.
2510000	2512000	I hope I'm here.
2512000	2514000	These structures that show up here.
2514000	2516000	It's already the biggest.
2516000	2518000	Simple complex is those facets.
2518000	2520000	That's it.
2520000	2522000	So if I put 111 here.
2522000	2524000	But here, I still want to fill in 111.
2524000	2526000	If you fill in 111.
2526000	2528000	This 111 is with the following 111.
2528000	2530000	Is each other.
2530000	2532000	Uh.
2532000	2534000	One of them is another subset.
2534000	2536000	Or vice versa.
2536000	2538000	I can't fill in 111 here.
2538000	2540000	So this time I can only fill in 111.
2540000	2542000	Then jump one to become one.
2542000	2544000	So these two won't be each other.
2544000	2546000	Subset.
2546000	2548000	Suppose.
2548000	2550000	In this line, I only need to fill in two 1s.
2550000	2552000	I can't fill in, for example, 111.
2552000	2554000	Because this 111.
2554000	2556000	It's going to be wrapped up in this 111.
2558000	2560000	So at that time, I tried a lot of this.
2560000	2562000	Fill in 1.
2562000	2564000	Fill in 1 and 0.
2564000	2566000	And then add it up and see if you can add it.
2566000	2568000	Uh, they gave this number.
2568000	2570000	That's what I just said.
2570000	2572000	The limitation is to make this problem difficult.
2572000	2574000	But I found some examples.
2574000	2576000	It's actually very simple.
2576000	2578000	For example, uh, if I'm here.
2578000	2580000	All of this.
2580000	2582000	If the input degree is all 1.
2582000	2584000	Then there are here.
2584000	2586000	Uh, 15.
2586000	2588000	So I'm going to have 15 1s here.
2588000	2590000	Then I can do this.
2590000	2592000	111.
2592000	2594000	Then jump one to become 111.
2594000	2596000	Then jump another 111.
2596000	2598000	Then I can easily create one.
2598000	2600000	A structure is in line with what I just said.
2600000	2602000	That one.
2602000	2604000	Degree size sequence.
2604000	2606000	So, uh.
2606000	2608000	My.
2608000	2610000	What about this job?
2610000	2612000	I thought of one.
2612000	2614000	The algorithm is a heuristic.
2614000	2616000	Uh, in computer science.
2616000	2618000	The meaning of the heuristic is that you have one.
2618000	2620000	You have a rule.
2620000	2622000	Uh, every step of your algorithm.
2622000	2624000	You have to go.
2624000	2626000	The rules are very local.
2626000	2628000	But.
2628000	2630000	Uh.
2630000	2632000	It's very surprising that you can use this rule.
2632000	2634000	This is a heuristic.
2634000	2636000	There is no way to guarantee that it is the best.
2636000	2638000	But it can also be used.
2638000	2640000	Then we found that.
2640000	2642000	Um, most of the.
2642000	2644000	Input sequence.
2644000	2646000	I can use the algorithm that I will talk about later.
2646000	2648000	To find an instance.
2648000	2650000	Yes, that's what I just said.
2650000	2652000	Add a key.
2652000	2654000	Um.
2654000	2656000	This thing on both sides of the input.
2656000	2658000	Good.
2658000	2660000	After I finish this algorithm.
2660000	2662000	I will skip some slides.
2662000	2664000	Then talk about mine.
2664000	2666000	I think it's an interesting interlude.
2666000	2668000	Then I will wrap up at the end.
2668000	2670000	This is my algorithm.
2670000	2672000	Of course I won't talk about this algorithm.
2672000	2674000	But, uh, his.
2674000	2676000	The idea is probably like this.
2676000	2678000	Uh, I want to try all the possible 0s and 1s.
2678000	2680000	But when I try it.
2680000	2682000	I don't want to try it randomly.
2682000	2684000	I hope that when I first started.
2684000	2686000	My input.
2686000	2688000	I arranged it from large to small.
2688000	2690000	4333321
2690000	2692000	Then this other size input.
2692000	2694000	I also arranged it in large and small.
2694000	2696000	After arranging it.
2696000	2698000	I started from the top down.
2698000	2700000	Fill in 1 or 0.
2700000	2702000	But when I fill it in.
2702000	2704000	I want to say.
2704000	2706000	This degree is big.
2706000	2708000	Hurry up and get together.
2708000	2710000	It becomes a simplex.
2710000	2712000	So I'm going to start from the left.
2712000	2714000	Slowly fill in the lower right corner.
2714000	2716000	So every time I fill it in.
2716000	2718000	I have a rule.
2718000	2720000	I want to.
2720000	2722000	Get together first.
2722000	2724000	That, uh.
2724000	2726000	When arranging.
2726000	2728000	I can also be sure.
2728000	2730000	Oh, by the way, this is a.
2730000	2732000	Um, this is a recursive algorithm.
2732000	2734000	I see a wild here.
2734000	2736000	Then, uh, I have some conditions.
2736000	2738000	In it.
2738000	2740000	Every time I fill in this 0 and 1.
2740000	2742000	Sometimes I can figure it out.
2742000	2744000	Sometimes I can know.
2744000	2746000	Is it wrong for me to fill in 0 and 1 like this?
2746000	2748000	For example.
2748000	2750000	For example, let's say I'm here.
2750000	2752000	I'm done here.
2752000	2754000	And then there's a 1 here.
2754000	2756000	And then, uh, here, uh.
2756000	2758000	Fill in another 1.
2758000	2760000	Then there's no way to fill in 1 here.
2760000	2762000	Because I already have four 1s here.
2762000	2764000	Then add it up and it's 4.
2764000	2766000	So if I fill in 1 here.
2766000	2768000	I'll be over 4.
2768000	2770000	Then I don't have to try this.
2770000	2772000	This is the condition of 1.
2772000	2774000	If it's in this line.
2774000	2776000	So, in fact, every line is filled in.
2776000	2778000	Uh, don't go any further.
2778000	2780000	Some of the conditions I can know.
2780000	2782000	And then I can delete this option.
2782000	2784000	And then, so he's actually a little bit.
2784000	2786000	Stupid way.
2786000	2788000	I really want to put all the possibilities.
2788000	2790000	All found.
2790000	2792000	It's just that when I'm looking for this possibility.
2792000	2794000	I have a specific sequence.
2794000	2796000	And then, uh.
2796000	2798000	The interesting thing about this study is that this specific sequence.
2798000	2800000	It's.
2800000	2802000	It's useful.
2802000	2804000	That.
2804000	2806000	We also have some in there.
2806000	2808000	Uh, for example, I.
2808000	2810000	I fill in one and then I.
2810000	2812000	Finally, I found that this road is different.
2812000	2814000	I will, uh, record that.
2814000	2816000	Ah, this road is different. I have a rejection.
2816000	2818000	Then if there are too many rejections, then I will give up.
2818000	2820000	Because I know this question is very difficult.
2820000	2822000	And then I don't want to.
2822000	2824000	Find all the possibilities.
2826000	2828000	That, uh.
2830000	2832000	Then I.
2832000	2834000	Uh, I'm going to do this part.
2834000	2836000	This part is what I'm going to do.
2836000	2838000	To do the test is what I hope.
2838000	2840000	I can find.
2840000	2842000	All add up to 13.
2842000	2844000	This whole series of all kinds.
2844000	2846000	So this is actually 101.
2846000	2848000	Add up to 101.
2848000	2850000	Add up to 13.
2850000	2852000	The whole series.
2852000	2854000	And then I'm 101 times 101.
2854000	2856000	All the possibilities.
2856000	2858000	And then I want to run.
2858000	2860000	Uh, the algorithm I just mentioned.
2860000	2862000	Will he get it?
2862000	2864000	A simple show is to get a simplex.
2864000	2866000	As his output.
2866000	2868000	Or did I finally give up?
2868000	2870000	That, uh.
2870000	2872000	What about here?
2872000	2874000	What I want to say is.
2874000	2876000	In fact, most of the.
2876000	2878000	Because, uh, here's a set.
2878000	2880000	I'm calculating how much time I spend.
2880000	2882000	And then my definition of time is how many times I have.
2882000	2884000	It's backwards.
2884000	2886000	Uh, I was.
2886000	2888000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
2888000	2890000	And then sometimes I might be in a certain meat.
2890000	2892000	I found no way.
2892000	2894000	I'm going to backtrack again.
2894000	2896000	Backtrack number.
2896000	2898000	Uh, the number I was rejected.
2898000	2900000	I was rejected.
2900000	2902000	Some very simple rules.
2902000	2904000	And then I found this road is different.
2904000	2906000	Most of them are white.
2906000	2908000	Or this gray.
2908000	2910000	So in fact, most of the.
2910000	2912000	Most of the input is simple.
2912000	2914000	So here I'm going to say.
2914000	2916000	In fact, most of the input is simple.
2916000	2918000	Ah, this one, I'm going to.
2918000	2920000	Jump over a little faster.
2920000	2922000	But this one is mainly about.
2922000	2924000	Well, this thing.
2924000	2926000	Uh, you can scale up.
2926000	2928000	To, uh.
2928000	2930000	Add up to 1,000.
2930000	2932000	This kind of, uh.
2932000	2934000	Simple complex.
2934000	2936000	It was just added to 13.
2936000	2938000	Now add up to 1,000.
2938000	2940000	Um, I can still.
2940000	2942000	Find it very quickly.
2942000	2944000	Some of the inside that.
2944000	2946000	Is it simple?
2946000	2948000	Uh.
2948000	2950000	With the time I spent doing this.
2950000	2952000	So.
2952000	2954000	And then I found that most of the.
2954000	2956000	The time it takes.
2956000	2958000	It's pretty rare.
2958000	2960000	It's within the time of the polynomial.
2960000	2962000	That's why I'm here.
2962000	2964000	The next conclusion is.
2964000	2966000	Hey, this method is a useful method.
2966000	2968000	I can, uh, take it.
2968000	2970000	Uh, random input.
2970000	2972000	I can use it to find a structure.
2972000	2974000	I might need to give up some.
2974000	2976000	Because I can't make sure.
2976000	2978000	What did I miss?
2978000	2980000	Because the problem itself is difficult.
2980000	2982000	But, uh, if I have a large number.
2982000	2984000	I can still use it to do something.
2984000	2986000	Useful statistical things.
2988000	2990000	Okay, and then, um.
2990000	2992000	With just.
2992000	2994000	So, um.
2994000	2996000	The progress of this paper is to say.
2996000	2998000	Uh, because I just said.
2998000	3000000	Uh, I'm looking for this.
3000000	3002000	When it comes to structure, I hope.
3002000	3004000	Uh, those big friends.
3004000	3006000	You have to get together first.
3006000	3008000	So, uh, is there anything special about this?
3008000	3010000	Some structures were found by me.
3010000	3012000	So, uh, I'm going to calculate.
3012000	3014000	Um, this.
3014000	3016000	There are a few holes in the structure.
3016000	3018000	So, this is a.
3018000	3020000	In that topological data analysis.
3020000	3022000	One of the standard methods.
3022000	3024000	If I have a complex.
3024000	3026000	I can ask him how many holes he has.
3026000	3028000	So.
3028000	3030000	That's a hole like this.
3030000	3032000	In the middle.
3032000	3034000	So, um.
3034000	3036000	If this hole is the number of this hole.
3036000	3038000	It's a kind of thing.
3038000	3040000	It's called Betty Numbers.
3040000	3042000	And then he'll have all kinds of different.
3042000	3044000	Dimensional holes, for example.
3044000	3046000	Um.
3046000	3048000	Betty Zero is.
3048000	3050000	He has a few.
3050000	3052000	There are two.
3052000	3054000	He only has one.
3054000	3056000	But he happens to have a hole.
3056000	3058000	So his Betty One is one.
3058000	3060000	And then Betty Zero is one.
3060000	3062000	H2 is a higher-level hole.
3062000	3064000	And so on.
3064000	3066000	it is good.
3066000	3068000	Start with love.
3068000	3070000	This is the second one.
3070000	3072000	Because this is just to say.
3072000	3074000	What I just said.
3074000	3076000	Um, that kind of heuristic.
3076000	3078000	There are really some special structures.
3078000	3080000	Is.
3080000	3082000	Created by me.
3082000	3084000	There is nothing.
3084000	3086000	It's not very scientific.
3086000	3088000	But he is.
3088000	3090000	One of the features of this algorithm.
3090000	3092000	This feature will help us find it.
3092000	3094000	Um, very scattered.
3094000	3096000	With very few holes.
3096000	3098000	This kind of structure.
3098000	3100000	That, um.
3102000	3104000	What about the focus?
3104000	3106000	It's not what this structure looks like.
3106000	3108000	But I can.
3108000	3110000	To build a bridge is from.
3110000	3112000	Input.
3112000	3114000	Find a structure.
3114000	3116000	And then I want to use someone else.
3116000	3118000	Randomize the method to find an ensemble.
3118000	3120000	And then answer some questions.
3120000	3122000	So this is just doing some.
3122000	3124000	Capitalization is about me.
3124000	3126000	Some features of the algorithm.
3126000	3128000	Okay, and then.
3128000	3130000	This is not an interlude.
3130000	3132000	That is to say, why do you have to count?
3132000	3134000	Because, uh, sometimes.
3134000	3136000	In fact, it is important to know how many holes there are in this data.
3136000	3138000	Take the one I just said.
3138000	3140000	Uh, in terms of the example of the brain area.
3140000	3142000	Uh, you can actually know that.
3142000	3144000	Uh, normal people's brains.
3144000	3146000	In some specific structure.
3146000	3148000	The number of holes.
3148000	3150000	With.
3150000	3152000	Uh, there are.
3152000	3154000	Um, external dropout.
3154000	3156000	A kind of neurological disease.
3156000	3158000	The structure of the brain.
3158000	3160000	These two.
3160000	3162000	The number of holes will be different.
3162000	3164000	This is a.
3164000	3166000	Uh, there are a few holes.
3166000	3168000	Um, it might be useful.
3168000	3170000	Um, the other place that might be useful.
3170000	3172000	Um, uh, it is.
3172000	3174000	Uh, uh, it is.
3174000	3176000	Um, signal processing.
3176000	3178000	Signal processing.
3178000	3180000	Um.
3180000	3182000	This thing is.
3182000	3184000	To say, let's say a.
3184000	3186000	Data, this data.
3186000	3188000	I observed these.
3188000	3190000	On a network.
3190000	3192000	This is all this gray.
3192000	3194000	It's all a network, and then.
3194000	3196000	All this is colored is the data I observed.
3196000	3198000	Then, in this data.
3198000	3200000	Because I am very clear now.
3200000	3202000	I see all the data.
3202000	3204000	I know there are two holes in this data.
3204000	3206000	Then, um, these two holes.
3206000	3208000	In the structure is very special.
3208000	3210000	But I observed this.
3210000	3212000	This one with color, this arrow.
3212000	3214000	I don't know what it is.
3214000	3216000	Uh, what does it have to do with this hole?
3216000	3218000	That, uh, there is a way.
3218000	3220000	That is, I can put.
3220000	3222000	These observed arrows.
3222000	3224000	Projected to.
3224000	3226000	Two holes above.
3226000	3228000	This is a bit like that.
3228000	3230000	The PCA that everyone learns statistics.
3230000	3232000	Because PCA will have two.
3232000	3234000	I can put it.
3234000	3236000	Projected up, and then look at it.
3236000	3238000	These two different directions.
3238000	3240000	Um, the information is not.
3240000	3242000	The biggest explanation.
3242000	3244000	Uh, the data I observed.
3244000	3246000	Then, if you put this data projected up.
3246000	3248000	You will find that, uh, these three have color lines.
3248000	3250000	Be grouped together.
3250000	3252000	Then the other three groups together.
3252000	3254000	Then the other three groups together.
3254000	3256000	Why are they grouped together?
3256000	3258000	Because of any.
3258000	3260000	In a group of lines, he has no way.
3260000	3262000	Don't skip this hole.
3262000	3264000	Deform to the side.
3264000	3266000	For example, I fix these two ends.
3266000	3268000	Then I want to pull this rope.
3268000	3270000	I can't get around this hole.
3270000	3272000	I can only be in this place.
3272000	3274000	Just squeeze together.
3274000	3276000	Yeah, so, um, this is one.
3276000	3278000	Can be from, uh.
3278000	3280000	You can get some from your data.
3280000	3282000	Some of the things that are related to the collection.
3282000	3284000	How to do things like this.
3284000	3286000	Then, um, this is.
3286000	3288000	A.
3288000	3290000	A small field called.
3290000	3292000	Signal processing.
3292000	3294000	Then I list some articles.
3294000	3296000	You can find some interesting examples in it.
3296000	3298000	That, um.
3298000	3300000	Finally, this video.
3300000	3302000	I'm going to skip it all.
3302000	3304000	What about this video?
3304000	3306000	It's about, um.
3306000	3308000	We if we.
3308000	3310000	If we limit our world.
3310000	3312000	It's a network.
3312000	3314000	If we can only see the network, then we.
3314000	3316000	We care about some of this network.
3316000	3318000	Um.
3318000	3320000	It's the number of holes.
3320000	3322000	So.
3322000	3324000	Uh, we.
3324000	3326000	And then we have some options.
3326000	3328000	For example, if this network is getting more and more dense.
3328000	3330000	In fact, we will feel that this hole will be more and more.
3330000	3332000	Because it's a network that's getting denser and denser.
3332000	3334000	So his circle.
3334000	3336000	His hole is getting more and more.
3336000	3338000	Um, but this intuition can't be.
3338000	3340000	Completely carried out.
3340000	3342000	Uh, in the complex, because.
3342000	3344000	Uh, because of the one I just said.
3344000	3346000	The limit of the complex.
3346000	3348000	So, um.
3348000	3350000	His.
3350000	3352000	His.
3352000	3354000	The description I just said just came back.
3354000	3356000	If it's a denser and denser complex.
3356000	3358000	His hole is actually getting less and less.
3358000	3360000	There are some of this.
3360000	3362000	Uh, some interesting things about the structure.
3362000	3364000	Interesting things.
3364000	3366000	Okay, so this is my final slide.
3366000	3368000	Um.
3368000	3370000	I think the most important piece of information is that we are now.
3370000	3372000	Uh, with this.
3372000	3374000	I developed this method.
3374000	3376000	It can be used.
3376000	3378000	For arbitrary degree size sequence.
3378000	3380000	I can use it to find a structure.
3380000	3382000	Then I can use it at this time.
3382000	3384000	Uh, someone else's.
3384000	3386000	Uh, random method, random network.
3386000	3388000	Then you can ask some statistical questions.
3388000	3390000	What about the second interesting thing?
3390000	3392000	Um, what I just said.
3392000	3394000	Uh, this computer science question.
3394000	3396000	He has a feature called.
3396000	3398000	This means.
3398000	3400000	Uh, if you go to Google.
3400000	3402000	MPCompany will be on his.
3402000	3404000	Wikipedia to find this picture.
3404000	3406000	In fact, the world in here.
3406000	3408000	It's still very rich.
3408000	3410000	Maybe it's simple and difficult.
3410000	3412000	So he is.
3412000	3414000	Uh.
3414000	3416000	Uh, I have.
3416000	3418000	That algorithm is written as a.
3418000	3420000	Python package.
3420000	3422000	Just open a terminal.
3422000	3424000	You can use this algorithm directly.
3424000	3426000	What about the last one?
3426000	3428000	I think this job has.
3428000	3430000	Uh.
3430000	3432000	There are some problems.
3432000	3434000	That's what I just said.
3434000	3436000	In fact, it should be.
3436000	3438000	In general, it's a difficult question.
3438000	3440000	Why is there a.
3440000	3442000	Simple algorithm can.
3442000	3444000	Count to the inside.
3444000	3446000	Most of them can be solved.
3446000	3448000	So why is he so successful?
3448000	3450000	Um.
3450000	3452000	I haven't been able to.
3452000	3454000	Uh, answer this question.
3454000	3456000	What about the rest of the statistics?
3456000	3458000	Yes, I can ask.
3458000	3460000	Um, if I.
3460000	3462000	See a data, I can think about it.
3462000	3464000	Um, this data is related to it.
3464000	3466000	After a few fixed parameters.
3466000	3468000	Randomized data.
3468000	3470000	Uh, what's the difference? Why is my data.
3470000	3472000	May be with.
3472000	3474000	Uh, I think it should be.
3474000	3476000	Uh.
3476000	3478000	It should be some.
3478000	3480000	Um, parameters.
3482000	3484000	I'm sorry.
3484000	3486000	Um, I'm in this data.
3486000	3488000	I have observed some.
3488000	3490000	I think it's interesting.
3490000	3492000	Uh, I hope to know.
3492000	3494000	Um.
3494000	3496000	Is it really interesting?
3496000	3498000	So in order to know this.
3498000	3500000	I need to randomize some parts.
3500000	3502000	That's a statistic.
3502000	3504000	Uh.
3504000	3506000	It's a long question.
3506000	3508000	Well, uh, a little bit more.
3508000	3510000	Because, uh.
3510000	3512000	This is a complex system.
3512000	3514000	A related one.
3514000	3516000	A question.
3516000	3518000	In the complex system, we usually have some components.
3518000	3520000	That's his agent.
3520000	3522000	Uh, the local structure I just said.
3522000	3524000	For example, I choose what kind of friends I want to make.
3524000	3526000	This is a choice I made.
3526000	3528000	But I'm the last.
3528000	3530000	Uh, the human society is a global thing.
3530000	3532000	That's it.
3532000	3534000	Is there any data?
3534000	3536000	Uh, we can ask.
3536000	3538000	Uh, the link between local and global.
3538000	3540000	Okay.
3540000	3542000	Um.
3542000	3544000	This is my list.
3544000	3546000	Uh, I think it's useful.
3546000	3548000	And then, because today's topic is.
3548000	3550000	Uh.
3550000	3552000	Related to the higher order network.
3552000	3554000	So these articles are all with, uh.
3554000	3556000	It's just some technical survey.
3556000	3558000	And then, uh.
3558000	3560000	I just talked about some data.
3560000	3562000	How to calculate the structure of this data.
3562000	3564000	Uh, there are three useful.
3564000	3566000	Uh, link for reference.
3566000	3568000	That, uh.
3568000	3570000	Uh, I think this area is.
3570000	3572000	Network science field.
3572000	3574000	And then, um, he has some communities.
3574000	3576000	For example, this net size is every year.
3576000	3578000	A meeting will be held.
3578000	3580000	That, uh.
3580000	3582000	I'm in this.
3582000	3584000	Um.
3584000	3586000	Since.
3586000	3588000	In this organization.
3588000	3590000	And then, um, they're every year.
3590000	3592000	Uh, we'll be here every year.
3592000	3594000	Some activities.
3594000	3596000	That, uh, we have a slack.
3596000	3598000	If you're interested in joining, you can.
3598000	3600000	Write an email to me.
3600000	3602000	It's useful.
3602000	3604000	The other thing is, um.
3604000	3606000	There is a seminar.
3606000	3608000	That, um.
3608000	3610000	Like Tara.
3610000	3612000	There will be some.
3612000	3614000	With network science.
3614000	3616000	Talk.
3616000	3618000	That corresponds to this diversified.
3618000	3620000	Net size symposium.
3620000	3622000	Okay.
3622000	3624000	I'm done.
3624000	3626000	Thank you.
3626000	3628000	Thank you.
3628000	3630000	Then we can turn on the microphone.
3630000	3632000	Applause.
3632000	3634000	Ok.
3634000	3636000	That.
3636000	3638000	Uh, is there a problem with the audience here?
3638000	3640000	Uh.
3640000	3642000	Uh, I have a question here.
3642000	3644000	I don't know if I can ask.
3644000	3646000	Um, please ask.
3646000	3648000	Let me turn on the microphone.
3648000	3650000	Uh, the organizer.
3650000	3652000	Then, how are you? I am.
3652000	3654000	Li Xuanwei from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
3654000	3656000	I heard the speech last time.
3656000	3658000	It was two years ago.
3658000	3660000	Then it's still exciting.
3660000	3662000	Thank you for sharing.
3662000	3664000	Because we have a topic.
3664000	3666000	There are also related research.
3666000	3668000	So I heard this.
3668000	3670000	I feel very excited to see if I can use it.
3670000	3672000	Our own research.
3672000	3674000	Then, uh, there are a few questions.
3674000	3676000	I want to ask Zixi.
3676000	3678000	There are about three.
3678000	3680000	The first one is.
3680000	3682000	Uh, we.
3682000	3684000	On the actual data.
3684000	3686000	Uh, there are a lot of different.
3686000	3688000	Uh.
3688000	3690000	Different types, like your node.
3690000	3692000	There are different types of nodes.
3692000	3694000	Like gender, male, female, race.
3694000	3696000	Black, white, Asian.
3696000	3698000	Like this is a note type.
3698000	3700000	That edge is also edge.
3700000	3702000	Then you can add different weight.
3702000	3704000	You can be 01.
3704000	3706000	You can also be a variety of numbers.
3706000	3708000	Or.
3708000	3710000	Uh, a few kinds of 0.51.
3710000	3712000	0123.
3712000	3714000	Or you can be a sign.
3714000	3716000	Different edge.
3716000	3718000	Then your edge can also be directional.
3718000	3720000	You can point to different places.
3720000	3722000	That's what you're using now.
3722000	3724000	This algorithm.
3724000	3726000	Have you ever thought that you can promote it in the future?
3726000	3728000	Different nodes or edge types.
3728000	3730000	I don't know if this is in the complex.
3730000	3732000	Will it be an extension?
3732000	3734000	An important extension.
3734000	3736000	This is the first question.
3736000	3738000	The second question is, um.
3738000	3740000	I'm curious.
3740000	3742000	This algorithm.
3742000	3744000	It's you give a sequence.
3744000	3746000	With, uh.
3746000	3748000	Uh, another one.
3748000	3750000	I forgot the name, but you give two sequences.
3750000	3752000	You can push it all.
3752000	3754000	Uh, a possible picture.
3754000	3756000	Even the future method can be calculated.
3756000	3758000	That if I give you today.
3758000	3760000	Is a part of the information.
3760000	3762000	Assuming I take my class.
3762000	3764000	I'm going to do a comparison of the data.
3764000	3766000	I have a class.
3766000	3768000	30 students.
3768000	3770000	Suppose only 10 students fill this information.
3770000	3772000	Then we assume that the information he filled is complete.
3772000	3774000	That I can use your method.
3774000	3776000	Calculate these 10 people.
3776000	3778000	Among the data given.
3778000	3780000	This may be behind you.
3780000	3782000	Maybe you didn't handle this article.
3782000	3784000	But a question behind it.
3784000	3786000	Your opinion is.
3786000	3788000	Take the data of these 10 people to restore the whole 30 people.
3788000	3790000	The ensemble on the board.
3790000	3792000	Then the credibility of this.
3792000	3794000	Is it worth doing this?
3794000	3796000	I don't really know.
3796000	3798000	This is the second one.
3798000	3800000	If you only get part of the observation information.
3800000	3802000	Can you guess the whole group?
3802000	3804000	Interaction.
3804000	3806000	What is the interaction of various high-level low-level?
3806000	3808000	The last question is.
3808000	3810000	You finally mentioned that.
3810000	3812000	Like persistent homology.
3812000	3814000	Indeed, in this field.
3814000	3816000	Development is very fast.
3816000	3818000	When we do social studies.
3818000	3820000	There will also be different holes.
3820000	3822000	You just said those holes.
3822000	3824000	We want to say that it is a high-level interaction.
3824000	3826000	In social studies, there is a hole called structural hole.
3826000	3828000	Structural hole is to say.
3828000	3830000	Between two groups.
3830000	3832000	It may not be so close.
3832000	3834000	There will be some key loopholes.
3834000	3836000	The two are more.
3836000	3838000	How to have a connected group.
3838000	3840000	Connected together.
3840000	3842000	I don't know if it's your observation.
3842000	3844000	Or your feeling.
3844000	3846000	These two holes.
3846000	3848000	One is from homology.
3848000	3850000	The hole of homology.
3850000	3852000	With social science.
3852000	3854000	On the graph.
3854000	3856000	Called structural hole.
3856000	3858000	Is it possible to have something to do with it?
3858000	3860000	Because you just said.
3860000	3862000	The conclusion is not necessarily the conclusion of homology.
3862000	3864000	The denser the picture, the less.
3864000	3866000	I always want to say these two.
3866000	3868000	I actually didn't think it through.
3868000	3870000	This is a very wonderful speech.
3870000	3872000	Thank you.
3872000	3874000	That was my three-year question.
3874000	3876000	Thank you.
3882000	3884000	First of all.
3884000	3886000	I want to say.
3886000	3888000	I think now.
3888000	3890000	Because these studies.
3890000	3892000	Are all based on data.
3892000	3894000	I want to have a data.
3894000	3896000	Then come and ask me.
3896000	3898000	The data is quite small.
3898000	3900000	Then.
3900000	3902000	There are more pictures.
3902000	3904000	So, in fact, there are some.
3904000	3906000	The study is how.
3906000	3908000	From one.
3908000	3910000	Observe the data in the picture.
3910000	3912000	Go.
3912000	3914000	Do statistics.
3914000	3916000	In fact.
3916000	3918000	For example, three people.
3918000	3920000	They are all connected to each other.
3920000	3922000	In fact, we express it as.
3922000	3924000	Three sides.
3924000	3926000	Three sides.
3926000	3928000	No than.
3928000	3930000	They are expressed as one.
3930000	3932000	A hyper edge.
3932000	3934000	It's still coming.
3934000	3936000	It's effective in statistics.
3936000	3938000	So there's a lot of this.
3938000	3940000	How from one.
3940000	3942000	Infer high order structure.
3942000	3944000	The question.
3944000	3946000	That.
3946000	3948000	So you just said.
3948000	3950000	You just said the question.
3950000	3952000	I want to refresh.
3952000	3954000	The second one is.
3954000	3956000	It's related to.
3956000	3958000	That is.
3958000	3960000	Can extend.
3960000	3962000	I just said this.
3962000	3964000	Configuration model work.
3964000	3966000	And then today.
3966000	3968000	If I have a data.
3968000	3970000	He.
3970000	3972000	There may be nodes.
3972000	3974000	For example, human network data nodes may have.
3974000	3976000	Racial and income and so on.
3976000	3978000	And then I'm going to fix it.
3978000	3980000	And then to generate an ensemble.
3980000	3982000	I do not know.
3982000	3984000	But I will.
3984000	3986000	All these questions I will go back.
3986000	3988000	Look at the graph.
3988000	3990000	I have no impression of the graph.
3990000	3992000	But I think.
3992000	3994000	It seems to be a very good starting point.
3994000	3996000	Because he.
3996000	3998000	Because he.
3998000	4000000	It can help us answer.
4000000	4002000	Other statistical issues.
4002000	4004000	We can.
4004000	4006000	That offline.
4006000	4008000	You can talk about this.
4008000	4010000	That.
4010000	4012000	Then the second question is.
4012000	4014000	With.
4014000	4016000	In fact, the first two questions.
4016000	4018000	I do not know.
4018000	4020000	The second question is today.
4020000	4022000	Say I have one.
4022000	4024000	I have a class of 50 people.
4024000	4026000	Then, of course, from.
4026000	4028000	I'm talking about this algorithm.
4028000	4030000	I can put it.
4030000	4032000	Randomization.
4032000	4034000	Randomization.
4034000	4036000	Every one.
4036000	4038000	You can take it as a statistical value.
4038000	4040000	To get a distribution.
4040000	4042000	But if I can only observe.
4042000	4044000	Part of the people in these 50.
4044000	4046000	How do I get from.
4046000	4048000	This part of the inside.
4048000	4050000	Get the most information.
4050000	4052000	In fact, I should have this distribution.
4052000	4054000	Get the most information.
4056000	4058000	I also think it is a very good research question.
4058000	4060000	I do not know.
4060000	4062000	And I think the two questions I just said.
4062000	4064000	In.
4064000	4066000	On the graph.
4066000	4068000	I do not seem to have seen such a job.
4068000	4070000	Just on the graph.
4070000	4072000	That.
4072000	4074000	That.
4074000	4076000	The third question.
4076000	4078000	It may be easier to answer.
4078000	4080000	Is.
4080000	4082000	So.
4082000	4084000	Uh, I sound like that.
4084000	4086000	It's more like a set.
4086000	4088000	A defined definition, right?
4090000	4092000	Uh, if that's the case.
4092000	4094000	Uh, because in.
4094000	4096000	Topology inside.
4096000	4098000	Topology.
4098000	4100000	This thing.
4100000	4102000	Um, he is.
4102000	4104000	There is a clear.
4104000	4106000	One of the.
4106000	4108000	Um.
4108000	4110000	It's technical.
4110000	4112000	I'm going to take this data.
4112000	4114000	Divided into different dimensions.
4114000	4116000	And then this dimension forms a circle complex.
4116000	4118000	And then the circle complex inside.
4118000	4120000	Different dimensions.
4120000	4122000	The so-called.
4122000	4124000	Boundary map link.
4124000	4126000	And then the boundary map is going to form some properties.
4126000	4128000	For example.
4128000	4130000	It must be zero.
4130000	4132000	That's it.
4132000	4134000	Because of a mathematical property like this.
4134000	4136000	Uh, I can do it inside.
4136000	4138000	To calculate the hole.
4138000	4140000	So, um.
4140000	4142000	So if it's a.
4142000	4144000	If it's a social network.
4144000	4146000	And then I'm going to ask.
4146000	4148000	The hole on it.
4148000	4150000	Um.
4150000	4152000	What's the connection?
4152000	4154000	I, I, I think.
4154000	4156000	Um.
4156000	4158000	I don't think it's possible to answer this question just by looking at the structure.
4158000	4160000	Because of your structure.
4160000	4162000	The definition of the hole is already.
4162000	4164000	Contains some.
4164000	4166000	Tributes related to nodes.
4166000	4168000	For example, who is.
4168000	4170000	The most influential of the two groups.
4170000	4172000	But if it's.
4172000	4174000	Uh, topology.
4174000	4176000	It's all about math.
4176000	4178000	You tell me.
4178000	4180000	What's the structure like?
4180000	4182000	Triangles filled with triangles.
4182000	4184000	There are a few filled with two sides.
4184000	4186000	So, and then calculate.
4186000	4188000	So.
4188000	4190000	The topology.
4190000	4192000	The hole in the topology.
4192000	4194000	It's all about the structure.
4194000	4196000	And then it might be with.
4196000	4198000	Um.
4198000	4200000	Related to sociology.
4200000	4202000	Structural hole is related.
4202000	4204000	It may not be related.
4204000	4206000	Thank you.
4206000	4208000	I hope I answered.
4208000	4210000	Yeah, I might be offline.
4210000	4212000	Ask something that we are interested in.
4212000	4214000	Show you again.
4214000	4216000	Thank you.
4222000	4224000	Do you have any questions?
4230000	4232000	Can I ask a question myself?
4232000	4234000	Just.
4234000	4236000	You just proposed a heuristic.
4236000	4238000	The algorithm.
4238000	4240000	Then.
4240000	4242000	In my opinion.
4242000	4244000	Because I'm not.
4244000	4246000	I'm not familiar with this at all.
4246000	4248000	In my opinion.
4248000	4250000	Your algorithm looks like.
4250000	4252000	If there is a solution.
4252000	4254000	If this algorithm finds a solution.
4254000	4256000	Then you are successful.
4256000	4258000	But in the picture you just showed.
4258000	4260000	It has those.
4260000	4262000	How did you do that?
4262000	4264000	Just.
4264000	4266000	My.
4266000	4268000	It looks like your algorithm.
4268000	4270000	I haven't finished all the calculations.
4270000	4272000	How do you know there is no solution?
4272000	4274000	Um.
4274000	4276000	This is a good question.
4276000	4278000	I skipped it because I was in a hurry.
4278000	4280000	Uh, because I know I can't.
4280000	4282000	I can't.
4282000	4284000	Explore all possibilities.
4284000	4286000	So I have set a cutoff.
4286000	4288000	Then.
4288000	4290000	If the number of failures is greater than the cutoff.
4290000	4292000	I said there was no solution.
4294000	4296000	But maybe I'll be more serious.
4296000	4298000	There will be a solution.
4298000	4300000	If I wait long enough, there will be a solution.
4300000	4302000	Yes, but on your picture.
4302000	4304000	The part that is not solved.
4304000	4306000	Isn't it white?
4308000	4310000	Isn't the white part?
4310000	4312000	Oh.
4312000	4314000	The reason is because that picture.
4314000	4316000	Is a very small example.
4316000	4318000	So in that example.
4318000	4320000	Basically I have all.
4320000	4322000	All explored.
4324000	4326000	All explored.
4326000	4328000	But my question is.
4328000	4330000	Your claim is.
4330000	4332000	More than 80% of the.
4332000	4334000	The problem will be solved.
4334000	4336000	But.
4336000	4338000	But in my opinion.
4338000	4340000	It seems that the white part is more than the other parts.
4340000	4342000	Isn't that just the case?
4346000	4348000	My claim.
4352000	4354000	My claim is.
4354000	4356000	In this larger network.
4356000	4358000	Is 80%.
4358000	4360000	OK.
4360000	4362000	But the example you just showed.
4362000	4364000	The network is too small.
4364000	4366000	Then the example I just showed.
4366000	4368000	In fact, it may also be 80%.
4368000	4370000	But it's just looking up here.
4370000	4372000	Then.
4372000	4374000	If there is a solution, it must be.
4374000	4376000	If there is a solution, it must be.
4376000	4378000	Oh.
4378000	4380000	Um.
4380000	4382000	This is the part I didn't talk about.
4382000	4384000	Um.
4384000	4386000	Because I.
4386000	4388000	If this is too large.
4388000	4390000	I will have a lot of possibilities.
4390000	4392000	I need to find.
4392000	4394000	So in this.
4394000	4396000	I chose a number.
4396000	4398000	Then I randomly.
4398000	4400000	In all possibilities.
4400000	4402000	After choosing this number.
4402000	4404000	Then this.
4404000	4406000	I figured out the number.
4406000	4408000	The ratio.
4408000	4410000	Then just.
4410000	4412000	The one I just said.
4412000	4414000	The example that adds up to 13.
4414000	4416000	It's probably from here.
4416000	4418000	So in other words.
4418000	4420000	You would expect to say.
4420000	4422000	Um.
4422000	4424000	You would expect to say probably.
4424000	4426000	Is less than.
4426000	4428000	0.01.
4428000	4430000	After you choose a size.
4430000	4432000	Then you will feel all the possibilities.
4432000	4434000	That's the one.
4434000	4436000	Add up to that size.
4436000	4438000	In those possibilities.
4438000	4440000	It's probably 0.01.
4440000	4442000	Find a simplicial.
4442000	4444000	OK.
4444000	4446000	Then we.
4446000	4448000	We say he is.
4448000	4450000	The method.
4450000	4452000	There are two.
4452000	4454000	One is that he has some obvious reasons.
4454000	4456000	I was rejected.
4456000	4458000	I think he won't have a simplicial possibility.
4458000	4460000	For example.
4460000	4462000	For example.
4462000	4464000	My.
4464000	4466000	For example.
4466000	4468000	It's all 3 here.
4468000	4470000	Add up to 15.
4470000	4472000	But I only have 15 here.
4472000	4474000	Or for example.
4474000	4476000	Add up to 15.
4476000	4478000	For example, here is 7.
4478000	4480000	Then here is 8.
4480000	4482000	Here is 8.
4482000	4484000	Then here is 7.
4484000	4486000	But this is 8.
4486000	4488000	Then I was rejected.
4488000	4490000	Is non-simplicial.
4490000	4492000	There are many parts.
4492000	4494000	It's a very simple reason.
4494000	4496000	Then.
4496000	4498000	There are quite a lot of parts.
4498000	4500000	I set the cutoff.
4500000	4502000	I gave up over time.
4506000	4508000	Another question is.
4508000	4510000	My other question is.
4510000	4512000	You later.
4512000	4514000	Said your.
4514000	4516000	Turistic algorithm.
4516000	4518000	He.
4518000	4520000	Usually find less holes.
4520000	4522000	Structure.
4522000	4524000	Will this cause.
4524000	4526000	After that.
4526000	4528000	Randomize.
4528000	4530000	Are you biased towards a certain structure?
4530000	4532000	You may not be completely.
4532000	4534000	Randomize your picture.
4536000	4538000	I think this is also a very good question.
4538000	4540000	Then.
4540000	4542000	They.
4544000	4546000	They did.
4546000	4548000	This randomization.
4548000	4550000	When this work.
4550000	4552000	It's already in his paper.
4552000	4554000	Explain that he thinks.
4554000	4556000	They do this.
4556000	4558000	Randomization.
4558000	4560000	Explore this space.
4560000	4562000	It's all connected.
4562000	4564000	So you can find it all.
4564000	4566000	That.
4566000	4568000	So this should not be a problem.
4568000	4570000	Then I do it myself.
4570000	4572000	The test did not feel.
4572000	4574000	I think.
4574000	4576000	I can't find a data.
4576000	4578000	Then from different starting points.
4578000	4580000	Then see if he is.
4580000	4582000	Different space.
4582000	4584000	It feels like it's all converged.
4586000	4588000	So this is a reasonable question.
4588000	4590000	Then we.
4590000	4592000	I have no evidence to say.
4592000	4594000	It will be different.
4594000	4596000	So I think.
4596000	4598000	It's good to find one.
4598000	4600000	The meaning of the so-called ergotic.
4600000	4602000	Say.
4602000	4604000	All possible.
4604000	4606000	All possible.
4606000	4608000	Those structures.
4608000	4610000	In.
4610000	4612000	After some kind of transformation.
4612000	4614000	It will become another.
4614000	4616000	The same thing.
4616000	4618000	Then.
4618000	4620000	But it can make a whole circle.
4620000	4622000	All possible structures.
4622000	4624000	Are interconnected.
4624000	4626000	The way to connect is in that kind of swap.
4626000	4628000	This thing.
4628000	4630000	Will not let all possible.
4630000	4632000	This instance.
4632000	4634000	Split in half.
4634000	4636000	OK.
4636000	4638000	So use his method.
4638000	4640000	All.
4640000	4642000	All possible structures will be connected.
4642000	4644000	So you run slowly.
4644000	4646000	You will run across the entire network.
4646000	4648000	Correct.
4648000	4650000	But there are many problems here.
4650000	4652000	That is.
4652000	4654000	It may take a long time to run slowly.
4654000	4656000	Correct.
4656000	4658000	Just like the ergotic of physics.
4662000	4664000	But.
4664000	4666000	This job is to provide a starting point.
4666000	4668000	Let people start from there.
4670000	4672000	Thank you.
4672000	4674000	Are there any questions here?
4676000	4678000	OK.
4678000	4680000	If not.
4680000	4682000	Thank you.
4682000	4684000	The recording is turned off.
4684000	4686000	OK.
