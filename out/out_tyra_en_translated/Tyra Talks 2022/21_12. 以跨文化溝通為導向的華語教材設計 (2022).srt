1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you for the introduction, and thank you to the audience.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't know how everyone is doing in the different time zones,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but I believe it's Sunday,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's almost noon.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I hope you can give me some feedback later.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me start by saying that what I'm going to share today

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is probably not the level of a seminar,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because it's a research project under development.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The rest of it is still ongoing,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so what I'm going to share with you later will be a preliminary version.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In addition, because it's still under development,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
my email will be announced later,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or this video will be released on YouTube, right?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It will be released on YouTube,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
so you are welcome to contact me.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But what I'm sharing today hasn't been published yet.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The last one is about to be published,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so that's fine.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So please don't quote it first.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But welcome to give me some advice.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, let's share my screen now.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to share my screen with you today.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What I'm going to share with you today

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is what I've been doing all along,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
which is a cross-cultural textbook.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can you all see it?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is a design and study of a Chinese textbook

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
with cross-cultural communication as its direction.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
First of all, I want to share these two sentences with you.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
One is what Hafiz said.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He said that if we don't have conflicts in this communication,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
frankly, it's hard for us to wake up to some things,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and it's hard for us to figure out some things about our own culture.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In addition, this is Mr. Gu Baili.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He was also one of the instructors in my doctoral class.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He said that when we do language learning and teaching today,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we shouldn't say language and culture.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Many of our courses are now called language and culture.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He said that we shouldn't say that.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why?

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because in fact, language and culture cannot be separated.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So he said that language should be in the culture.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So he thinks that culture is bigger.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Language is just a little bit of a cultural expression.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So he thinks that the expression of language and culture is not in a language system.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In fact, it extends to the actual common purpose of language.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Next, I want to share with you why I did this research.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It started about 20 years ago.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When I was very young, I translated this book.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It is also the first academic paper to study the students of the Chinese Language Center in Taiwan.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The cultural adaptation of these foreign students after they came to Taiwan.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
At that time, this scholar was Sister Grace Boyce.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She was a professor of social studies.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She was also a nun.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She was very concerned about the adaptation of these foreign students at the time.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So she did a lot of research.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This research was done very well.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She also won a prize at that time.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So she published it.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was very honored to be able to translate this book and this paper.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When I finished translating this paper,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
it gave me a great personal shock and inspiration.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It turned out that cultural adaptation is such a difficult thing.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
At the end of this report,

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
she gave a lot of suggestions on how to help foreign students adapt to their mother tongue.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course, it includes the suggestions of the residents themselves.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How to be mentally prepared.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How to change your attitude.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How to integrate this culture before and after.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But she also gave some suggestions to the language center and teachers.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This was a very fresh thing for me at the time.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She said that the language center also needs to pay attention to the special needs of foreign students.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We need to help them improve their self-level and culture.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And those who are mentally prepared may be in a target country.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course, it was in Taiwan at the time.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There may be some cultural resurgence.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She thinks that language teachers should also be fully prepared.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because they are often the first foreign students to come into close contact with their mother tongue.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So she should become a very rich resource to help these foreign students.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So that they can successfully achieve a local cultural adaptation and public communication.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The biggest inspiration that this book gave me was that language teachers are not just teaching languages.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What she wants to help is cultural adaptation and help her students communicate properly.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I think that language teachers probably also need some ability to cross the cultural ocean.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
To be able to do a good job of native teaching.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is my opening.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Next, we will continue to share my research motivation and background.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
First of all, in our foreign language learning, we will learn from first language to second language.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or the second second language.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Some people will say this is language 3.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What we often notice is the distance between our mother tongue and our target language.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
For example, the Romanian language may be very close.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The Romanian language itself may be very close.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For example, if a French person wants to learn Chinese, the language distance is very far.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We often use this standard to measure language learning.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And measure the difficulty of language learning.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But in fact, we often ignore that the real purpose of language learning is to communicate.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In fact, every language contains the culture behind it.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is the distance from L1 to L2 equal to the distance of the target language culture?

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In fact, sometimes it is not.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So the difficulty of language is not equal to the distance of culture.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
For example, maybe learning a similar German and English.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If we are a person with a mother tongue.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe on the cultural distance.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We have not done a deep analysis of this.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Maybe we are on the cultural understanding of German countries.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In fact, it may be more difficult than, for example, the target language of American English.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In recent years, I have been paying a lot of attention to the part of cross-cultural learning.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Therefore, language learning should pay attention to deep learning.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That is, to be able to understand the culture of the target language.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In order to achieve the purpose of proper communication.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this is also a motivation for me to write.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Next, among the Chinese textbooks mainly in Taiwan.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We see that most of them are still learning in the original.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Among them are some spiritual cultural points.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In fact, I feel that the Chinese textbooks in the United States are almost the same.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But they may have some textbooks.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
For example, the IC textbook will particularly emphasize the so-called cultural highlight part.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In addition, we often say that the cultural class in the center of the original cultural class.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It is also often noticed that a professor of old culture.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Including, for example, the study of calligraphy that everyone often sees.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Or it is based on a variety of precepts.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There will be some related activities of wrapping zongzi.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In addition, there is also the so-called information culture of this textbook.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
For example, the information of the goal and the country.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Including local people, history, geography.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
For example, the Center for International Studies will hold a course on Taiwan today.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Discuss some of Taiwan's news or social phenomena.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
For example, this kind of textbook is very familiar to everyone.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Today's Taiwan is probably one of these informational cultural textbooks.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In recent years, there have also been some textbooks with a cross-cultural understanding as the orientation.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
For example, this is the teacher of our university.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the Taiwan comic book.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Taiwan comic book has a way of writing.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It is a kind of cultural contrast.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
For example, the theme is sports.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What is the sport that Taiwanese people like?

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What is the sport that Americans like?

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is your participation in sports?

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It makes a cross-cultural comparison and explanation.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
However, the textbooks written specifically for this kind of behavior culture in cross-cultural communication are still very lacking.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So we see that many of our Chinese students may come to Taiwan.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He still has no way.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Even if his language ability is very high, there is still no way to achieve a purpose of physical communication.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So this set of textbooks, I hope that the starting point of textbooks that can be developed is like this.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It can help learners to have early awareness and understanding.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It may face a cross-cultural difficulty caused by cultural differences.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And reduce the anxiety and confusion in real communication.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In the end, it reaches the goal of being able to communicate with native speakers.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In other words, it is a two-way good communication.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,000
In other words, foreign students can communicate with native speakers at ease based on their own understanding of cultural differences.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
At the same time, his own speech can also make native speakers feel at ease and not be offended.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's take a quick look at this part of the theory.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
First is Helmer Lee.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Helmer Lee was probably the first to bring the theory of cultural courses to language learning.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's what we just talked about.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In fact, Chinese language learning and Chinese culture learning should include these three elements.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The textbook I made today emphasizes this third element, behavior culture.

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Next, we just have to talk about ICC, Intercultural Communication Competence.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Intercultural Communication Competence.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We will probably start with Byron.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Byron's ICC model.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's take a quick look at it.

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is an indicator that we wrote on the textbook.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Byron thinks that in terms of cross-cultural recognition, knowledge and behavior,

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the five indicators of cross-cultural communication competence are attitude, knowledge, cultural interpretation,

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
cultural discovery, interaction, and cultural self-awareness.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The key point of Byron's cross-cultural communication competence is not only the ability of a cross-culturalist to express his goal-oriented culture,

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but also to make his own culture and goal-oriented culture a link, a comparison,

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and become an observer with independent thinking ability.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In fact, he emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Next, we have Fatini's ICC model.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think everyone is familiar with it.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is an indicator of cross-cultural communication competence.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It includes several aspects, including human relations, communication, collaboration, and cooperation.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In addition, there are four other components, such as attitudes.

177
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I will briefly talk about them.

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
These are the key points of cross-cultural communication competence.

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Next, we will talk about the third-space theory, which has been valued more and more in recent years.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The third-space theory originates from the theory of Homi Bhabha, an Egyptian scholar.

181
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It has been extended to our cross-cultural teaching.

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The concept of the third space is different from the concept of intermediate language.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Intermediate language is a transition process between one language and two languages.

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The third space in culture is to create a space of compromise between culture and goal.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It is a dynamic part, but it emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding and observation.

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Professor Wu Yongyi also mentioned that learners learn two languages not only to acquire a tool for communication,

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
but also to improve their cognitive and thinking ability.

188
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Recently, Dr. Zhang Xin also brought the third-space theory to the approach of cross-cultural teaching.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Finally, we will talk about the five C's of the American Foreign Language Teaching Association.

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The five C's are the most important indicators of successful foreign language learning.

191
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I especially like this picture.

192
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There are different importance and different aspects in the five C's.

193
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This picture puts the five C's of communication at the center.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Communication consists of three aspects.

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Communication is realized by the input and output of four kinds of learning.

196
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Finally, the four C's are closely integrated into the communication ability of language learning.

197
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's take a quick look at the relevant parts of cross-cultural teaching.

198
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The first is the interpersonal communication in communication.

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It refers to being able to freely communicate with people under the basis of understanding the context.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Sometimes people don't understand the context,

201
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but because they don't understand the context, they can't interact with people in a positive way.

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The next is the understanding and interpretation.

203
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Understanding and interpretation are usually placed in language teaching,

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
but I believe that many foreign language teachers are particularly impressed by this.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Many languages ​​are not equivalent to the meaning of the text.

206
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
For example, you are so beautiful today.

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Then you say that your eyes and nose are beautiful.

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In fact, they understand the meaning of the word,

209
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but they don't understand the meaning of the word in the context.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The real meaning is humility.

211
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Next, after understanding,

212
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
learners should be able to confidently demonstrate it,

213
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
say it, or write it.

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The next is the 3P in culture, which we are very familiar with.

215
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We can compare this with Hamelin,

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and there are some similarities.

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But in fact, in the 5Cs of Apple,

218
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
it does not refer to the behavioral culture mentioned by Hamelin.

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But it may be shown in other 5Cs.

220
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The next is the connection,

221
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
which is to expand one's connection to the world and the target language through the learning of a foreign language.

222
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The next is the comparison.

223
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Comparison is, of course, in our language learning,

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
including language comparison, including cultural comparison.

225
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The last is Communities,

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
which is to be able to create a bilingual community activity,

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
or to be able to enter Communities when entering a target language country.

228
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What I want to emphasize is that many of our foreign students,

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
for example, they are always in a language center,

230
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
or they are friends with foreign students.

231
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
In fact, it is to encourage them to enter the target language Communities.

232
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Finally, I would like to quickly say that

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in fact, this Hamelin,

234
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
his cultural learning indicators,

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
for me, gave me a lot of inspiration in my writing and teaching.

236
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He said how to train yourself,

237
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
including a comment event,

238
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
a cultural fairy tale,

239
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and how to investigate in a role-play way,

240
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
as well as the discussion of the values of the target language language culture,

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
cultural understanding and learning,

242
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
as well as the list of cultural elements.

243
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Next, I will briefly introduce the theory of the background of cross-culturalization to you.

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then we will enter the concept of the description of my entire textbook.

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
First of all, based on all the cross-culturalization just mentioned,

246
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the ability to communicate,

247
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and the purpose of reaching a cross-culturalization,

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we will find that the cross-culturalization comes from two things.

249
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The first is that you have to feel comfortable.

250
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Language learning has to feel comfortable.

251
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The second is that people with goals and countries should feel comfortable and not be offended.

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So, when I was doing a data collection,

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I noticed this kind of data collection.

254
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's take a look.

255
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
In fact, the whole framework of communication includes so many elements.

256
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But in general,

257
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the purpose of language learning is to achieve proper communication.

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But in general,

259
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
in fact, we will probably pay more attention to this part of the current textbook.

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But the part of the blue frame, the part of the non-language part,

261
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and some cultural parts,

262
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the cultural parts of Behavioral,

263
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
are actually less written for it.

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Next, let's take a look.

265
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, when I was doing the demand analysis,

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
it was different from the general textbook in terms of data collection.

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The collection of my textbook

268
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
will collect a lot of real context and scenes of cross-culturalization.

269
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, I started to do a lot of interviews,

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and I did an in-depth interview with foreign students who came to Taiwan,

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and their contacts,

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
including their Chinese teachers and general teachers.

273
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Why?

274
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Because during my interview,

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I visited foreign students first.

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Foreign students think that Chinese teachers are their biggest source of language,

277
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
or the best resource for all kinds of cultural adaptation.

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It is also a clear object in their mind.

279
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We found that foreign students think that Chinese teachers and general teachers,

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
many of our foreign students do not come to Taiwan to learn Chinese,

281
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
they may be international students.

282
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So, the teachers they come into contact with are not the Chinese teachers who understand different student cultures very well,

283
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but the teachers of general science.

284
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The teachers of general science may not come into contact with a large number of foreign students,

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
so they often have some communication barriers.

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, in fact, there is a big difference between teachers and students.

287
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Then there are their roommates,

288
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Taiwanese roommates,

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and some foreign students,

290
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
they are technical families.

291
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So, this is where my main scenario comes from.

292
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Next, I would like to quickly share with you my interview with this cross-border group,

293
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
including these three.

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I am one of the technical families.

295
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is a resource that you rarely come into contact with,

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
a source of barrier to cultural communication.

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Let me share with you.

298
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is a technical family's interview question.

299
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
At the time of my interview, the epidemic broke out in Taiwan.

300
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it's probably all online.

301
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
At that time, it was usually a family of two or three groups.

302
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Sometimes it was a family of one or two groups,

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
depending on the time.

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In fact, when these families interviewed,

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
they contributed some very rich cases of getting along.

306
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And you will find that they often have a lot of common problems,

307
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
some common problems.

308
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So this is the question I asked them.

309
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Before the interview,

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I had already read a lot of articles about the barriers to Chinese culture

311
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
by foreign students.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So when I was leading,

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I would actually put these,

314
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
when discussing,

315
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
when discussing something that is not rich enough,

316
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I would also give them some hints

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to see if they really,

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
really encountered this kind of communication difficulty.

319
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's also a kind of correction.

320
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So let's take a look.

321
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
My question is probably from the technical family itself,

322
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
his feelings.

323
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then there's his observation.

324
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And then there's the reaction of foreign students to him.

325
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
We interviewed a total of 10 families.

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A lot of people have even more than 10 years of experience.

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They have hosted dozens of foreign students.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And then they became long-term good friends.

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's very rare for them to share this kind of experience.

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's very different from what the Chinese teacher said.

331
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They are actually more living.

332
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
In addition, I will also ask them the last question.

333
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
When we asked the Chinese teacher this question,

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
of course,

335
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
what do you think can be put in the textbook?

336
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Chinese teachers are professional,

337
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
so their sharing is in place.

338
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But I later found that the technical family's sharing is very interesting.

339
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not quite the same as what our Chinese professor thinks.

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They think,

341
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
how come I don't know this,

342
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know that.

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Didn't your teacher teach you?

344
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I later put some of the things they shared

345
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
into the case I'm going to share today.

346
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay, so that's probably one of my ways of interviewing.

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Next, in my interview,

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
a preliminary analysis,

349
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
we found some very special things.

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The first is that in fact,

351
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
foreign students have a great difference in the difficulty of cross-cultural communication,

352
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
including different countries and different geographical locations.

353
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
For example,

354
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
European and American students complain that Taiwan is very hot.

355
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Southeast Asian students complain that Taiwan is very cold.

356
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That also includes the issue of race.

357
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
For example,

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the same issue is the issue of Chinese students in the United States,

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and the issue of non-Chinese white people,

360
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and the issue of people with skin color.

361
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The cultural barriers they encounter are very, very different.

362
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Of course, it also includes the issue of religion.

363
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
For example,

364
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
students with a Christian background

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
find it very difficult to find the real food,

366
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and find it very difficult.

367
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
There is also the issue of gender.

368
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
For example,

369
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
male students who are white

370
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
are often worshipped as idols,

371
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
or black male students

372
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
are often asked some very impolite questions

373
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in the south-central region,

374
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and even asked to touch their hair.

375
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Then there is the age difference.

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Foreign students of different ages

377
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
also have a great difference in their feelings.

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So after my interview,

379
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I actually have two ideas.

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The first is that

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
our textbook should show the issue of universality,

382
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and also the issue of racial discrimination.

383
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So my textbook today

384
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is mainly for students with a North American background.

385
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Next,

386
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
this is an analysis of the source of the entire article.

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So behind it,

388
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
there is our highest indicator,

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
which is the ability to communicate.

390
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Next,

391
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I have already found some documents.

392
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You probably know

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the difficulties of cultural adaptation.

394
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Next is our interview.

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It is actually mainly to collect a context,

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
so that our textbooks are more consistent.

397
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This is a real context.

398
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Next,

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
this set of communication of miniaturized textbooks,

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the design of miniaturized textbooks,

401
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is a starting point for the students themselves.

402
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I originally planned to shoot this set of textbooks in Taiwan.

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Then,

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I would present it in a video format.

405
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Unfortunately,

406
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
before I came to the United States,

407
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
the epidemic in Taiwan broke out.

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So this film was not able to be shot.

409
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Later,

410
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I changed this kind of textbook

411
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to use a large number of pictures to present.

412
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So I hope it is a video textbook.

413
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Next,

414
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it is mainly for miniaturized communication.

415
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It is not just a set of textbooks.

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So it is probably suitable for A2 or above.

417
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
If you are a second-year student in the United States,

418
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
you will have some simple Chinese grammar,

419
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and then you will have a certain vocabulary ability.

420
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Even if he has some vocabulary ability,

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
he will not be able to achieve it.

422
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He will also be familiar with the description of the vocabulary we provide.

423
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He can learn it by reading it.

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Next,

425
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
it is suitable for soldiers who will stay in Taiwan.

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He will stay in Taiwan for a long time.

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He is not a tourist,

428
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
or even a short-term primary school student.

429
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Primary school students are very limited in contact with the local area.

430
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He may stay in Taiwan for more than half a year.

431
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
In addition,

432
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I hope it is a set suitable for self-study.

433
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think language textbooks

434
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
need a professional language teacher.

435
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A good textbook teaching method.

436
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But I think culture,

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
based on a certain level of language,

438
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
can actually continue.

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Next,

440
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
let's talk about this quickly.

441
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is the assessment we may do later.

442
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Actually,

443
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I haven't done this part yet.

444
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let's skip it.

445
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm afraid we don't have enough time.

446
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's take a look now.

447
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The design of my entire course structure.

448
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What we will see later is not a video.

449
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It will be text and pictures.

450
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Next,

451
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
we will provide some interactive questions.

452
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The main thing is to promote the cultivation of his cultural ability,

453
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
including some cultural comparisons and cultural insights.

454
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We will ask him in different ways.

455
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We will also tell him

456
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
why it is like this.

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What is the culture behind him?

458
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This part is an analysis of a cultural point.

459
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I wrote this part in English.

460
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This part is about understanding,

461
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
not learning the language itself.

462
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So we need to let the students know it,

463
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and know why.

464
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Most students will say,

465
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
teacher, are you full?

466
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We all say that

467
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
it's good to be taught by a language teacher.

468
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But why do I say, teacher, are you full?

469
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Why do you have to say hello and eat?

470
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If he knows,

471
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
he will feel more warm.

472
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
At the end,

473
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
there will be some discussion and suggestions.

474
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you really feel uncomfortable,

475
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
how do I express it to him?

476
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Next,

477
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
let's take a look.

478
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I collected these cultural points.

479
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Actually, I received a lot of these points.

480
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But I basically only made four lessons.

481
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Two lessons are related to the class.

482
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
One is the interaction with the teacher.

483
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The other is the cultural conflict in the classroom.

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The second is the general life,

485
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
including visiting friends and staying in the dormitory.

486
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But this dormitory is not a general dormitory.

487
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
For example,

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Americans and Americans live in the same dormitory.

489
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Frankly speaking, there is no problem.

490
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's amazing that the bathroom looks different,

491
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
the bed is harder,

492
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
these things.

493
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
In fact, there is no communication problem.

494
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But if he lives outside,

495
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
especially with Taiwanese roommates,

496
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
this conflict is very big.

497
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
What we are going to share later is

498
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the class of visiting friends.

499
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm sorry,

500
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
my screen is very blurry.

501
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In fact,

502
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
his speech should appear after the point.

503
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The picture will be better.

504
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In order to overcome this,

505
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I can't make it into a video.

506
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So I tried my best to find some pictures that look very blurry.

507
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This is the person in the picture.

508
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We are going to visit this person and his grandmother.

509
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Let's take a look at the development of our course.

510
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Jian Ting is Wenjie's good friend in Taiwan.

511
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
This weekend,

512
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Jian Ting invites Wenjie to visit his grandmother.

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Please note that

514
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
in our language course,

515
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
we will call grandma,

516
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
grandma.

517
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We won't call grandma.

518
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
In fact,

519
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
our course is designed to target Taiwan as a country.

520
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So I believe everyone can understand.

521
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
In Taiwan,

522
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
the opportunity to call grandma is much more than to call grandma.

523
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So I deliberately put grandma.

524
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Why?

525
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Because this is also what I received.

526
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A student in the south.

527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He learned Chinese very well.

528
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But he found that there are many people who don't speak Mandarin in the south.

529
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So when he learned Chinese,

530
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
he went to the southeast.

531
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He couldn't order food in the night market.

532
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He didn't understand Mandarin.

533
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So it caused a cultural problem.

534
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So I put him in front of grandma.

535
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then make a simple explanation.

536
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Then let's take a look.

537
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He said,

538
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

539
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I am Li Wenjie.

540
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What is your name?

541
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We see that the language teacher is very good.

542
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He wants to use honorifics.

543
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But he asked grandma,

544
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
what is your name?

545
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Grandma was very suspicious.

546
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Why would anyone ask my name?

547
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I am Lin Meizhu.

548
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Then he said,

549
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you can call me grandma like Jian Ting.

550
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then Wenjie said,

551
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
okay, grandma, hello.

552
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Let's take a look.

553
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This cultural point,

554
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
everyone should feel it.

555
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He said,

556
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
please put on slippers.

557
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
He said,

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
oh, I forgot.

559
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I have to take off my shoes.

560
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My socks are broken.

561
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm so sorry.

562
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Then Jian Ting said,

563
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
it doesn't matter.

564
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Grandma, this is a gift for you.

565
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Open it and take a look.

566
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I hope you like it.

567
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
As a result,

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
grandma said,

569
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
thank you, you're welcome.

570
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Put the gift next to it.

571
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Please drink hot tea.

572
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Wenjie can't stand it, right?

573
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's so hot.

574
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Can you give me a cup of iced tea?

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Jian Ting said, okay.

576
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Then next,

577
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
grandma asked Jian Ting,

578
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you tell Jian Ting,

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you help me ask Wenjie.

580
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Does he have a girlfriend?

581
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Grandma wants to introduce him.

582
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What did Wenjie say?

583
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Grandma, I understand Chinese.

584
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You can talk to me directly.

585
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Thank you,

586
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but I like to find a girlfriend myself.

587
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't know what you think of this class.

588
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think if there are a lot of Chinese teachers on site,

589
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
you should have seen

590
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
how many cultural points there are.

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Let's take a look.

592
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This is what's next.

593
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
After we provide the text and vocabulary,

594
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we're going to take the second step.

595
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We're going to have an interactive stimulus.

596
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So let's look at this first.

597
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

598
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm Li Wenjie.

599
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What's your name?

600
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is actually...

601
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's hard for us to tell students.

602
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We're interacting in Chinese class, right?

603
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What's my name?

604
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What's your name?

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But in real life,

606
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
when we visit our grandparents in the countryside,

607
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
we don't seem to be able to ask them

608
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
what their names are.

609
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right?

610
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So here,

611
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we have the first question.

612
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Do you think Wenjie is a good greeting?

613
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
This is the first point.

614
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let him have a cultural awareness.

615
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So we let him choose.

616
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
He thinks it's good.

617
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That's what all teachers do, right?

618
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Next,

619
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
it might be a little weird.

620
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
He can't ask his grandparents' names directly.

621
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Next,

622
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of course,

623
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
we'll tell him that

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it's not convenient for us to ask his name directly.

625
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
We usually stop here.

626
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Don't ask your grandparents' names.

627
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But students will find it strange.

628
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Why can I ask,

629
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but he can't?

630
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So,

631
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
we need to look further.

632
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We need to know what we want to know.

633
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That's how we can reach a deeper understanding.

634
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So we use the English term

635
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
for the greeting culture.

636
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Actually,

637
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
in Chinese,

638
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the greeting culture of the Chinese

639
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
is an ancient culture.

640
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's impolite to ask his name directly.

641
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Especially the elders.

642
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So you can ask your grandparents' names directly.

643
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But the elders can't.

644
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
They can't.

645
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So they might say,

646
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
or whatever.

647
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's how it usually goes.

648
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
We can only ask his name.

649
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Next,

650
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
let's look at the second one.

651
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
He said,

652
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
you can call me grandma like Jianting.

653
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This grandma is kind.

654
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wenjie said,

655
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
okay,

656
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
grandma,

657
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
hello.

658
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We see that their elders call them grandma.

659
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's a very intimate thing.

660
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But for an American student,

661
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm afraid he'll feel very uncomfortable.

662
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So we ask him,

663
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
if someone asks you to call someone you just met,

664
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
this granny,

665
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
in the American language,

666
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
granny is really just your grandma.

667
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It could also be a good friend.

668
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But you have to be familiar.

669
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You can't meet an old lady on the road and call her granny.

670
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So we ask him how he feels.

671
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Take care of his feelings.

672
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think it's good.

673
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Very intimate.

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or I think it's strange.

675
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But we have to bring out this cultural point.

676
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Why?

677
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Taiwanese people don't call names.

678
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
In the United States,

679
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
from old to young,

680
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you can call names.

681
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No matter how important it is,

682
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
you can call their names.

683
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But we often use family names.

684
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Here's another explanation.

685
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
How do you call people?

686
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
How do you call people?

687
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then here,

688
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
you can do a simple cultural practice.

689
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
A simple cultural practice.

690
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In fact, this is because there is no video.

691
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
If it's a video,

692
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you should say,

693
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
this person,

694
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
what do you call him?

695
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What do you call him?

696
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Something like that.

697
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay.

698
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Let's move on.

699
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This is just a point of communication.

700
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In fact,

701
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
in this painting,

702
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
in order to achieve a real woman,

703
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I didn't make these cultural points a distinction.

704
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What is behavioral culture?

705
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What is information culture?

706
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That is,

707
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
based on the scene.

708
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Based on the scene of a visit.

709
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So what he brought here

710
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is an information culture.

711
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
In Taiwan,

712
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
it's almost like changing shoes.

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Of course,

714
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
we also need to achieve a sense of humor

715
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and a sense of

716
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
a sense of humor

717
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and a sense of realism.

718
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Right?

719
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In the United States,

720
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
you really don't have to compromise.

721
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm afraid this kind of embarrassment will happen.

722
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So,

723
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
to increase their understanding.

724
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Okay.

725
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So,

726
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
let's start with his own problem.

727
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
His own culture.

728
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Do you compromise when you go home?

729
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you compromise when you visit a friend's house?

730
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Next,

731
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
if you are asked to go out,

732
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
how do you feel?

733
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And then,

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
can you not compromise?

735
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Especially if

736
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
your socks just have a hole.

737
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Can you?

738
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
How to communicate properly.

739
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Next,

740
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
let's tell him why

741
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
compromise in Taiwan.

742
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
In fact,

743
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it's not just Taiwan.

744
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Most countries compromise.

745
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then,

746
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
let him judge.

747
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This,

748
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
this feeling,

749
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the point where you feel uncomfortable,

750
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
can it be reflected?

751
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But in fact,

752
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the result is probably

753
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that you can't help but compromise.

754
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay,

755
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
so this is an English explanation.

756
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay,

757
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
next.

758
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay,

759
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
this is the culture of giving gifts.

760
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Okay,

761
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
our culture is the culture of giving gifts.

762
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay,

763
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Americans say,

764
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
oh,

765
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I prepared it for you.

766
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Please open it and take a look.

767
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay,

768
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
but grandma is an old-fashioned person,

769
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
right?

770
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He's embarrassed to open it in public.

771
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Okay,

772
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
so he said,

773
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
thank you,

774
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you're welcome.

775
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I didn't open it.

776
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay,

777
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
next,

778
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
let's see.

779
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
This is also a foreign student

780
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
who reflects

781
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
the culture of giving gifts in Taiwan.

782
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Taiwanese also reflect

783
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
the culture of giving gifts to foreign students.

784
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
What's behind it?

785
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
This,

786
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
foreign students think

787
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Taiwanese are generous.

788
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
There are a lot of gifts

789
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
for him,

790
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
very valuable.

791
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Taiwanese think

792
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
foreign students

793
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
are very stingy.

794
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I gave him such an expensive gift.

795
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How can he give me

796
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
such a worthless gift?

797
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay,

798
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
as you can see,

799
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
this is not a matter of generosity,

800
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
but a matter of cultural difference.

801
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So,

802
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
let's take a quick look here.

803
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Okay,

804
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
uh,

805
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
he may have a way.

806
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay,

807
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ask him,

808
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
why do you think

809
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
the goal of this country's grandma is

810
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that she doesn't open it,

811
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
she just puts it next to it?

812
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay,

813
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and then,

814
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
it creates a cultural contrast.

815
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Here we talk about

816
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the Chinese culture

817
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
as a sign of sincerity

818
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to give gifts.

819
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But,

820
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in the United States,

821
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
he may really be

822
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
a kind person.

823
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Uh,

824
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
what did you do?

825
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Uh,

826
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
even,

827
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
uh,

828
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
give a bouquet,

829
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
which is a very good gift.

830
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
His main expression

831
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is the part of that friendship.

832
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So,

833
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
it will cause a political difference

834
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
between the two sides

835
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
in giving gifts.

836
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It caused a misunderstanding,

837
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
uh,

838
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
caused a kind of,

839
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
uh,

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
a misunderstanding in this understanding.

841
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay,

842
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
next,

843
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
we will talk about

844
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
some details

845
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in the Chinese culture

846
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
of giving gifts.

847
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Then,

848
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
this cultural point

849
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
will lead to

850
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
the culture of giving gifts.

851
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay,

852
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I want to

853
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
finish it as soon as possible.

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Uh,

855
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
next,

856
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
like,

857
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
for example,

858
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
drinking iced tea,

859
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
this kind of thing,

860
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
do you really have to be patient

861
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
to completely ignore

862
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
your own culture?

863
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
In fact,

864
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
not necessarily.

865
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
For example,

866
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
drinking water,

867
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
you really don't want to drink hot water.

868
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Uh,

869
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
you can actually say,

870
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
you don't want to drink cold water.

871
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay,

872
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
okay,

873
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
next,

874
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
this is a,

875
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I am,

876
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I am,

877
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
uh,

878
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I have collected all of these,

879
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
uh,

880
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
uh,

881
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
these,

882
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
uh,

883
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
it should be said that

884
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I did not collect this

885
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
in the academic paper,

886
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
but when I did this,

887
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I was later in,

888
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
uh,

889
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
a U.S. election,

890
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
when I handed this out,

891
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
there was a student

892
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
who was almost

893
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
saying that

894
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
really,

895
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
when I was in Taiwan,

896
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I encountered

897
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
a point that

898
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
was very special.

899
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
This is really,

900
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
this is,

901
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
he,

902
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
especially the two

903
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
foreign students

904
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
who shared it,

905
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
they shared it very vividly,

906
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
they were very unhappy

907
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and very angry that

908
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
he was obviously

909
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
good at English,

910
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
he was good at Chinese,

911
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
he just didn't talk to me,

912
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
he just wanted to talk to me

913
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
through that person.

914
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Okay,

915
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
let's take a look at

916
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
these,

917
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
these will all

918
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
have some explanations

919
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
why

920
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Chinese is indirectly

921
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
transmitted.

922
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Is it rude?

923
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Or is it

924
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
bullying you?

925
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Maybe not,

926
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
maybe sometimes

927
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
it's about

928
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
respect for that person,

929
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
respect for the person who introduced him,

930
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
maybe sometimes

931
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
he's just

932
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
shy.

933
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Okay,

934
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
then I think

935
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
we'll start

936
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
with the

937
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
textbook sharing

938
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
here.

939
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay,

940
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
then later,

941
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I put these

942
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
four courses

943
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
in the

944
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
University of

945
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
the United States

946
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
as a

947
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
working method

948
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
for

949
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
this

950
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Chinese learner,

951
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and then

952
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
to a

953
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
certain

954
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
level of Chinese,

955
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and then

956
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
this

957
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
feedback is

958
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
very good,

959
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
very good.

960
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Some of them

961
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
have been to Taiwan,

962
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and even

963
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
those who have been to

964
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Taiwan,

965
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I personally

966
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
interviewed them

967
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
again,

968
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
they felt

969
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
that

970
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
they felt

971
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
in place,

972
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
so

973
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I was

974
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
very confident

975
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
in

976
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
writing

977
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
this

978
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
textbook,

979
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
so

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I can

981
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
probably

982
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
continue to

983
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
write

984
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
this

985
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
textbook.

986
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Okay,

987
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
then I

988
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
will

989
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
move on

990
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to the

991
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
next

992
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
discussion

993
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
topic,

994
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
which

995
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is,

996
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
uh,

997
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
does

998
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
cross-cultural

999
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
teaching

1000
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
require

1001
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
nationalization

1002
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
design?

1003
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Because

1004
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
C1 to

1005
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
C2

1006
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
are

1007
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
not

1008
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
equal,

1009
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
right?

1010
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Okay,

1011
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
next,

1012
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
cross-cultural

1013
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
teaching

1014
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
design.

1015
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Thank you,

1016
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Dai Ping.

1017
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's really

1018
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
very interesting.

1019
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't

1020
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
know

1021
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
if

1022
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
anyone

1023
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
at the

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
scene

1025
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
has any

1026
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
questions

1027
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
for the

1028
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
audience?

1029
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes,

1030
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
or

1031
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
do you have

1032
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
any suggestions?

1033
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I believe

1034
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
if there are

1035
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Chinese

1036
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
teachers

1037
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
or

1038
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
learners

1039
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
at the

1040
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
scene,

1041
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
they

1042
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
can

1043
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
share

1044
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
their

1045
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
thoughts

1046
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and

1047
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
experiences

1048
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
with

1049
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
the

1050
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
audience.

1051
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I

1052
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
think

1053
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
it's

1054
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
very

1055
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
important

1056
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
to

1057
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
share

1058
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
your

1059
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
thoughts

1060
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and

1061
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
experiences

1062
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
with

1063
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
the

1064
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
audience.

1065
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I

1066
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
think

1067
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
it's

1068
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
very

1069
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
important

1070
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
to

1071
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
share

1072
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
your

1073
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
thoughts

1074
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and

1075
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
experiences

1076
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
with

1077
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the

1078
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
audience.

1079
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I

1080
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
think

1081
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it's

1082
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
very

1083
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
important

1084
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to

1085
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
share

1086
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
your

1087
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
thoughts

1088
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and

1089
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
experiences

1090
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
with

1091
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
the

1092
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
audience.

1093
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Thank

1094
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
you.

1095
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Thank

1096
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you.

1097
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Thank

1098
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
you.

1099
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Thank

1100
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
you.

1101
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Thank

1102
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
you.

1103
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Thank

1104
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
you.

1105
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
My

1106
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
next

1107
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:19,000
question

1108
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:38,000
is

1109
00:45:38,000 --> 00:46:03,000
about

1110
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Internet

1111
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
connections.

1112
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes, but I think this paper mainly focuses on the feelings of the local people, the goal and the country.

1113
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We usually collect the feelings of our second language learners.

1114
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yes, but in fact, this will produce a big blind spot.

1115
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That is, he does not know that his own language behavior is causing the other party's discomfort.

1116
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh, okay.

1117
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes, so what I received this time was, for example, the technical family and their roommates.

1118
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In addition to the foreign students, in fact, their feedback is very, very rich.

1119
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
At this moment, I did not see the complaints part.

1120
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
In fact, I have a lot of complaints.

1121
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
For example, he blamed his American roommates for not turning off the lights and air conditioning.

1122
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But in fact, I know that this is because of the overall difference in life.

1123
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
In the United States, everyone really does not turn off the lights and air conditioning.

1124
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
He is not particularly wasteful.

1125
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yes, so there are some differences in the environment behind him that cause such a difference.

1126
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But it will cause a barrier to cultural communication.

1127
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
For example, American students will be labeled as wasteful or something.

1128
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because in the United States, there is really no need to turn off the lights and air conditioning.

1129
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
For example, they must turn on the air conditioning in winter.

1130
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Otherwise, it will freeze, right?

1131
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes, yes.

1132
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And in the end, just adjust the temperature.

1133
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's not particularly a waste of electricity.

1134
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes, it's like this.

1135
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So it's because the environment in Taiwan itself is different, so it's incomprehensible.

1136
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yes, but if you let American students know,

1137
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
he can at least have a chance to explain that if he forgets, it's because of me.

1138
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
In this case, it's not easy to create a barrier to communication.

1139
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Or it's a kind of stereotype.

1140
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Okay, thank you.

1141
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Thank you.

1142
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I think your research has discussed many aspects of cultural communication.

1143
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I was thinking about this.

1144
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because there are many aspects of culture that are difficult to explain directly.

1145
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
For example, we have L1 and L2 transfer.

1146
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You can say which is positive transfer and which is negative transfer.

1147
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
You can compare and see which is which.

1148
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because culture is also a different distance, a different understanding.

1149
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't know if there is...

1150
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Because I feel like I'm learning another culture.

1151
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And I feel like there are a lot of...

1152
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
From the most basic, face-to-face, to visit someone.

1153
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You have a lot of interactions that don't seem to go well.

1154
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yes, and then I think, wow, how can I finish learning like this?

1155
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And then I think, is there...

1156
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I don't know if this is practical or useful.

1157
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
For example, C1, Cultural 1 transfer.

1158
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Is there a place where they can say, this is actually...

1159
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Increase awareness.

1160
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I think your question will increase a lot of intercultural awareness.

1161
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But I don't know if it will help them.

1162
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh, this is...

1163
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I don't know.

1164
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Which ones are similar and which ones are really different?

1165
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yes, you see, language ability is very good at measuring, right?

1166
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And the test knows where you are.

1167
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
OPI does it and you know where the language ability is.

1168
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But cultural ability is really hard to measure.

1169
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And language ability is not equal to cultural ability.

1170
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
We see some people.

1171
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
His Chinese is not very good, but he is very good at communicating.

1172
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But his communication is very solid, right?

1173
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That may be a kind of self-awareness.

1174
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Or his own attitude.

1175
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He himself has a respect for the goal language culture.

1176
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Like and his open heart.

1177
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So in fact, I think this part of cultural learning.

1178
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
His variability is greater.

1179
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Really big.

1180
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And there are a lot of points to learn.

1181
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So that's why I think.

1182
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I also want to ask everyone to share.

1183
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Do you think cultural learning is suitable for self-learning?

1184
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Plus the combination of the media now.

1185
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
He is very diverse.

1186
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
He is very diverse.

1187
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Then it's okay.

1188
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Then the length is not the same.

1189
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We are online teaching materials.

1190
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We don't need to be limited by time.

1191
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So I am completely based on the situation.

1192
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Where should this situation go?

1193
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Where is it?

1194
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
What are the points of this situation?

1195
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Let it happen naturally.

1196
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Then there is the description of the whole situation.

1197
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I am very grateful to my audience.

1198
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
My situation is actually from their narrative.

1199
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Of course, you have to sort it out more smoothly.

1200
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
More interesting.

1201
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Something like that.

1202
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So I am talking about myself.

1203
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I am talking about the direction of writing a new textbook.

1204
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Is this really helpful?

1205
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
The purpose of communication.

1206
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I can understand you.

1207
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Do you think this textbook direction is reasonable?

1208
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think you wrote that.

1209
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Because you want to use the way of the film.

1210
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Because I think this intercultural experience.

1211
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Communication failure.

1212
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Such an experience.

1213
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I think it is an experiential learning.

1214
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But because of this.

1215
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I think it is a good experience.

1216
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I think it is a good experience.

1217
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Experiential learning.

1218
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Because if you are not experienced.

1219
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It is difficult to understand.

1220
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
This is very common.

1221
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
This is very common.

1222
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Or specific cases.

1223
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Sometimes you feel.

1224
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
This is really like this.

1225
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
If it is really a different culture.

1226
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So I think if you use a film.

1227
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You can see some.

1228
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You can't say it with blood or photos.

1229
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Because you have written.

1230
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Facial expression.

1231
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You can't feel these.

1232
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You can't feel these.

1233
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
For example, pauses.

1234
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Feedback to pauses.

1235
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Feedback to pauses.

1236
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That is very important.

1237
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That is invisible.

1238
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That is really.

1239
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Verbal.

1240
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That is the most difficult.

1241
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It must rely on the film.

1242
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I received a lot of.

1243
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Internet celebrities in Taiwan.

1244
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Their films are very interesting.

1245
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But they must be their own feelings.

1246
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Take it as a film.

1247
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It is more like a gradual progress.

1248
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Or some behind the scenes.

1249
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Excitement.

1250
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It means that everyone is watching very lively.

1251
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Of course, I also learned some things.

1252
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But you see it.

1253
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It is very suitable for self-study.

1254
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I think it is very suitable for self-study.

1255
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I think it is very suitable for self-study.

1256
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Because they have to have that.

1257
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
If there is no environment.

1258
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
No real contact with the locals.

1259
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
No way to understand.

1260
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
This is a communication.

1261
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
This is a communication failure.

1262
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This is a communication failure.

1263
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think you have collected information.

1264
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think you have collected information.

1265
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
For example, his technical family.

1266
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Some of his contacts.

1267
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Some information.

1268
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I think it is very important.

1269
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Because I think in terms of language learning.

1270
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
In addition to learning to communicate with the locals.

1271
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
In addition to learning to communicate with the locals.

1272
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Locals.

1273
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They also have a culture difference.

1274
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
They also have a culture difference.

1275
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They also have a cultural competence.

1276
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They also have a culture competence.

1277
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
They have to know.

1278
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
How to interact with those

1279
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
How to interact with those

1280
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Thai language learners in the cultural field.

1281
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Thai language learners in the cultural field.

1282
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I do n't know what to do

1283
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
How to accept

1284
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
How to accept

1285
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
How to train

1286
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
How to train

1287
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And get to know

1288
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
What is appropriate

1289
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
What is appropriate

1290
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
How to train

1291
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What is appropriate

1292
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
How to train

1293
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
How to train

1294
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
How to train

1295
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Thai

1296
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Thai

1297
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Thai

1298
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Thai

1299
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Thai

1300
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Thai

1301
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I think that's very difficult

1302
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I received that

1303
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I still can't think of a good

1304
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
expression

1305
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's hard to explain

1306
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Because silence has all kinds of situations

1307
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Thank you

1308
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
This is very difficult

1309
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I think you see, my world is still a

1310
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Relatively easy

1311
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Some cultural backgrounds that are easier to understand

1312
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right

1313
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Ok

1314
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Time is almost up

1315
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Is there anyone else

1316
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Is there anyone else

1317
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Who has anything to say

1318
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
This is my email

1319
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This is my email

1320
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So if you have any

1321
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Experience or comments

1322
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
If you want to talk to me

1323
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Write to me

1324
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Thank you

1325
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Thank you

1326
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
If there are no questions

1327
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I want to thank you for this wonderful speech

1328
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I think your textbook is very interesting

1329
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I think it's very useful

1330
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
For

1331
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
For

1332
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
For international students

1333
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Who come to Taiwan

1334
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So I'm looking forward to their use

1335
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You said this summer

1336
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
They will start using this textbook

1337
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Or if you have students who want to come to Taiwan

1338
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You can recommend it to me

1339
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I can also share this textbook with him

1340
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And then by the way, ask him to give me some feedback

1341
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Please contact

1342
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Free learning opportunities

1343
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Ok

1344
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
If anyone wants to provide funding

1345
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
To help us make a video

1346
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Probably not

1347
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think

1348
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
If you hear any information

1349
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I will definitely share it with you

1350
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I think this is a very meaningful textbook

1351
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Thank you for spending so much time

1352
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's very interesting

1353
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Actually, I thought I could shoot when I came to the United States

1354
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I want to say

1355
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You can always make it look like

1356
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But I gave up

1357
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Because it's really hard to be exactly the same

1358
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Then just don't

1359
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Just don't

1360
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Just have to shoot in place

1361
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yes

1362
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So I'm looking forward to the next development

1363
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
If there is

1364
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
If there is

1365
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
For example, when you finish writing

1366
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Because you are still

1367
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I don't plan to finish writing

1368
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Because it's just a few lessons

1369
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yes, just a few lessons

1370
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Then slowly expand

1371
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That's it

1372
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Thank you

1373
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Your follow-up

1374
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Please keep in touch

1375
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Ok

1376
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Thank you

1377
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Thank you all

1378
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Goodbye
