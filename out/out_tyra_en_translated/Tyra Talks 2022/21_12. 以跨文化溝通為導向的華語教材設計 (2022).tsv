0	4000	Thank you for the introduction, and thank you to the audience.
4000	7000	I don't know how everyone is doing in the different time zones,
7000	10000	but I believe it's Sunday,
10000	12000	and it's almost noon.
12000	13000	Thank you.
13000	17000	I hope you can give me some feedback later.
17000	20000	Let me start by saying that what I'm going to share today
20000	23000	is probably not the level of a seminar,
23000	26000	because it's a research project under development.
26000	31000	The rest of it is still ongoing,
31000	35000	so what I'm going to share with you later will be a preliminary version.
35000	38000	In addition, because it's still under development,
38000	42000	my email will be announced later,
42000	48000	or this video will be released on YouTube, right?
48000	50000	It will be released on YouTube,
50000	52000	so you are welcome to contact me.
52000	57000	But what I'm sharing today hasn't been published yet.
57000	59000	The last one is about to be published,
59000	61000	so that's fine.
61000	65000	So please don't quote it first.
65000	68000	But welcome to give me some advice.
68000	71000	Okay, let's share my screen now.
75000	79000	I'm going to share my screen with you today.
80000	83000	What I'm going to share with you today
83000	87000	is what I've been doing all along,
87000	90000	which is a cross-cultural textbook.
94000	97000	Can you all see it?
97000	101000	This is a design and study of a Chinese textbook
101000	106000	with cross-cultural communication as its direction.
106000	109000	First of all, I want to share these two sentences with you.
109000	111000	One is what Hafiz said.
111000	116000	He said that if we don't have conflicts in this communication,
116000	119000	frankly, it's hard for us to wake up to some things,
119000	122000	and it's hard for us to figure out some things about our own culture.
122000	126000	In addition, this is Mr. Gu Baili.
126000	132000	He was also one of the instructors in my doctoral class.
132000	137000	He said that when we do language learning and teaching today,
137000	140000	we shouldn't say language and culture.
140000	143000	Many of our courses are now called language and culture.
143000	145000	He said that we shouldn't say that.
145000	146000	Why?
146000	149000	Because in fact, language and culture cannot be separated.
149000	152000	So he said that language should be in the culture.
152000	154000	So he thinks that culture is bigger.
154000	157000	Language is just a little bit of a cultural expression.
157000	162000	So he thinks that the expression of language and culture is not in a language system.
162000	168000	In fact, it extends to the actual common purpose of language.
168000	173000	Next, I want to share with you why I did this research.
173000	177000	It started about 20 years ago.
177000	183000	When I was very young, I translated this book.
183000	193000	It is also the first academic paper to study the students of the Chinese Language Center in Taiwan.
193000	198000	The cultural adaptation of these foreign students after they came to Taiwan.
198000	203000	At that time, this scholar was Sister Grace Boyce.
203000	205000	She was a professor of social studies.
205000	207000	She was also a nun.
207000	211000	She was very concerned about the adaptation of these foreign students at the time.
211000	213000	So she did a lot of research.
213000	215000	This research was done very well.
215000	218000	She also won a prize at that time.
218000	220000	So she published it.
220000	226000	I was very honored to be able to translate this book and this paper.
226000	229000	When I finished translating this paper,
229000	233000	it gave me a great personal shock and inspiration.
233000	237000	It turned out that cultural adaptation is such a difficult thing.
237000	241000	At the end of this report,
241000	250000	she gave a lot of suggestions on how to help foreign students adapt to their mother tongue.
250000	253000	Of course, it includes the suggestions of the residents themselves.
253000	255000	How to be mentally prepared.
255000	257000	How to change your attitude.
257000	261000	How to integrate this culture before and after.
261000	267000	But she also gave some suggestions to the language center and teachers.
267000	270000	This was a very fresh thing for me at the time.
270000	277000	She said that the language center also needs to pay attention to the special needs of foreign students.
277000	281000	We need to help them improve their self-level and culture.
281000	287000	And those who are mentally prepared may be in a target country.
287000	290000	Of course, it was in Taiwan at the time.
290000	293000	There may be some cultural resurgence.
293000	298000	She thinks that language teachers should also be fully prepared.
298000	304000	Because they are often the first foreign students to come into close contact with their mother tongue.
304000	311000	So she should become a very rich resource to help these foreign students.
311000	317000	So that they can successfully achieve a local cultural adaptation and public communication.
317000	326000	The biggest inspiration that this book gave me was that language teachers are not just teaching languages.
326000	333000	What she wants to help is cultural adaptation and help her students communicate properly.
333000	338000	So I think that language teachers probably also need some ability to cross the cultural ocean.
338000	343000	To be able to do a good job of native teaching.
343000	346000	This is my opening.
346000	351000	Next, we will continue to share my research motivation and background.
351000	359000	First of all, in our foreign language learning, we will learn from first language to second language.
359000	361000	Or the second second language.
361000	363000	Some people will say this is language 3.
363000	370000	What we often notice is the distance between our mother tongue and our target language.
370000	374000	For example, the Romanian language may be very close.
374000	377000	The Romanian language itself may be very close.
377000	384000	For example, if a French person wants to learn Chinese, the language distance is very far.
384000	389000	We often use this standard to measure language learning.
389000	392000	And measure the difficulty of language learning.
392000	398000	But in fact, we often ignore that the real purpose of language learning is to communicate.
398000	404000	In fact, every language contains the culture behind it.
404000	411000	Is the distance from L1 to L2 equal to the distance of the target language culture?
411000	413000	In fact, sometimes it is not.
413000	417000	So the difficulty of language is not equal to the distance of culture.
417000	424000	For example, maybe learning a similar German and English.
424000	426000	If we are a person with a mother tongue.
426000	428000	Maybe on the cultural distance.
428000	432000	We have not done a deep analysis of this.
432000	436000	Maybe we are on the cultural understanding of German countries.
436000	443000	In fact, it may be more difficult than, for example, the target language of American English.
443000	451000	In recent years, I have been paying a lot of attention to the part of cross-cultural learning.
451000	458000	Therefore, language learning should pay attention to deep learning.
458000	462000	That is, to be able to understand the culture of the target language.
462000	465000	In order to achieve the purpose of proper communication.
465000	470000	So this is also a motivation for me to write.
470000	475000	Next, among the Chinese textbooks mainly in Taiwan.
475000	479000	We see that most of them are still learning in the original.
479000	482000	Among them are some spiritual cultural points.
482000	488000	In fact, I feel that the Chinese textbooks in the United States are almost the same.
488000	490000	But they may have some textbooks.
490000	495000	For example, the IC textbook will particularly emphasize the so-called cultural highlight part.
495000	500000	In addition, we often say that the cultural class in the center of the original cultural class.
500000	503000	It is also often noticed that a professor of old culture.
503000	508000	Including, for example, the study of calligraphy that everyone often sees.
508000	512000	Or it is based on a variety of precepts.
512000	515000	There will be some related activities of wrapping zongzi.
515000	520000	In addition, there is also the so-called information culture of this textbook.
520000	525000	For example, the information of the goal and the country.
525000	529000	Including local people, history, geography.
529000	534000	For example, the Center for International Studies will hold a course on Taiwan today.
534000	540000	Discuss some of Taiwan's news or social phenomena.
540000	544000	For example, this kind of textbook is very familiar to everyone.
544000	549000	Today's Taiwan is probably one of these informational cultural textbooks.
549000	555000	In recent years, there have also been some textbooks with a cross-cultural understanding as the orientation.
555000	558000	For example, this is the teacher of our university.
558000	560000	This is the Taiwan comic book.
560000	562000	Taiwan comic book has a way of writing.
562000	564000	It is a kind of cultural contrast.
564000	566000	For example, the theme is sports.
566000	568000	What is the sport that Taiwanese people like?
568000	570000	What is the sport that Americans like?
570000	573000	What is your participation in sports?
573000	576000	It makes a cross-cultural comparison and explanation.
577000	586000	However, the textbooks written specifically for this kind of behavior culture in cross-cultural communication are still very lacking.
586000	591000	So we see that many of our Chinese students may come to Taiwan.
591000	593000	He still has no way.
593000	598000	Even if his language ability is very high, there is still no way to achieve a purpose of physical communication.
598000	604000	So this set of textbooks, I hope that the starting point of textbooks that can be developed is like this.
604000	608000	It can help learners to have early awareness and understanding.
608000	612000	It may face a cross-cultural difficulty caused by cultural differences.
612000	616000	And reduce the anxiety and confusion in real communication.
616000	622000	In the end, it reaches the goal of being able to communicate with native speakers.
622000	628000	In other words, it is a two-way good communication.
628000	641000	In other words, foreign students can communicate with native speakers at ease based on their own understanding of cultural differences.
641000	647000	At the same time, his own speech can also make native speakers feel at ease and not be offended.
647000	652000	Let's take a quick look at this part of the theory.
653000	655000	First is Helmer Lee.
655000	661000	Helmer Lee was probably the first to bring the theory of cultural courses to language learning.
661000	663000	That's what we just talked about.
663000	667000	In fact, Chinese language learning and Chinese culture learning should include these three elements.
667000	672000	The textbook I made today emphasizes this third element, behavior culture.
672000	681000	Next, we just have to talk about ICC, Intercultural Communication Competence.
681000	683000	Intercultural Communication Competence.
683000	685000	We will probably start with Byron.
685000	689000	Byron's ICC model.
689000	691000	Let's take a quick look at it.
691000	696000	This is an indicator that we wrote on the textbook.
696000	703000	Byron thinks that in terms of cross-cultural recognition, knowledge and behavior,
703000	711000	the five indicators of cross-cultural communication competence are attitude, knowledge, cultural interpretation,
711000	717000	cultural discovery, interaction, and cultural self-awareness.
717000	729000	The key point of Byron's cross-cultural communication competence is not only the ability of a cross-culturalist to express his goal-oriented culture,
729000	742000	but also to make his own culture and goal-oriented culture a link, a comparison,
742000	748000	and become an observer with independent thinking ability.
748000	753000	In fact, he emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding.
753000	756000	Next, we have Fatini's ICC model.
756000	758000	I think everyone is familiar with it.
758000	760000	This is an indicator of cross-cultural communication competence.
760000	771000	It includes several aspects, including human relations, communication, collaboration, and cooperation.
771000	776000	In addition, there are four other components, such as attitudes.
776000	780000	I will briefly talk about them.
780000	786000	These are the key points of cross-cultural communication competence.
786000	795000	Next, we will talk about the third-space theory, which has been valued more and more in recent years.
795000	806000	The third-space theory originates from the theory of Homi Bhabha, an Egyptian scholar.
806000	811000	It has been extended to our cross-cultural teaching.
811000	819000	The concept of the third space is different from the concept of intermediate language.
819000	824000	Intermediate language is a transition process between one language and two languages.
824000	840000	The third space in culture is to create a space of compromise between culture and goal.
840000	849000	It is a dynamic part, but it emphasizes a kind of two-way understanding and observation.
849000	859000	Professor Wu Yongyi also mentioned that learners learn two languages not only to acquire a tool for communication,
859000	864000	but also to improve their cognitive and thinking ability.
864000	877000	Recently, Dr. Zhang Xin also brought the third-space theory to the approach of cross-cultural teaching.
878000	888000	Finally, we will talk about the five C's of the American Foreign Language Teaching Association.
888000	895000	The five C's are the most important indicators of successful foreign language learning.
895000	898000	I especially like this picture.
898000	906000	There are different importance and different aspects in the five C's.
906000	912000	This picture puts the five C's of communication at the center.
912000	920000	Communication consists of three aspects.
920000	930000	Communication is realized by the input and output of four kinds of learning.
930000	940000	Finally, the four C's are closely integrated into the communication ability of language learning.
940000	947000	Let's take a quick look at the relevant parts of cross-cultural teaching.
947000	951000	The first is the interpersonal communication in communication.
951000	957000	It refers to being able to freely communicate with people under the basis of understanding the context.
957000	962000	Sometimes people don't understand the context,
962000	968000	but because they don't understand the context, they can't interact with people in a positive way.
968000	972000	The next is the understanding and interpretation.
972000	975000	Understanding and interpretation are usually placed in language teaching,
975000	983000	but I believe that many foreign language teachers are particularly impressed by this.
984000	988000	Many languages ​​are not equivalent to the meaning of the text.
988000	992000	For example, you are so beautiful today.
992000	996000	Then you say that your eyes and nose are beautiful.
996000	998000	In fact, they understand the meaning of the word,
998000	1002000	but they don't understand the meaning of the word in the context.
1002000	1005000	The real meaning is humility.
1005000	1007000	Next, after understanding,
1007000	1012000	learners should be able to confidently demonstrate it,
1012000	1015000	say it, or write it.
1015000	1021000	The next is the 3P in culture, which we are very familiar with.
1021000	1025000	We can compare this with Hamelin,
1025000	1027000	and there are some similarities.
1027000	1030000	But in fact, in the 5Cs of Apple,
1030000	1036000	it does not refer to the behavioral culture mentioned by Hamelin.
1036000	1039000	But it may be shown in other 5Cs.
1039000	1043000	The next is the connection,
1043000	1052000	which is to expand one's connection to the world and the target language through the learning of a foreign language.
1052000	1055000	The next is the comparison.
1055000	1059000	Comparison is, of course, in our language learning,
1059000	1062000	including language comparison, including cultural comparison.
1062000	1064000	The last is Communities,
1064000	1070000	which is to be able to create a bilingual community activity,
1070000	1077000	or to be able to enter Communities when entering a target language country.
1077000	1082000	What I want to emphasize is that many of our foreign students,
1082000	1086000	for example, they are always in a language center,
1086000	1090000	or they are friends with foreign students.
1090000	1096000	In fact, it is to encourage them to enter the target language Communities.
1096000	1099000	Finally, I would like to quickly say that
1099000	1102000	in fact, this Hamelin,
1102000	1106000	his cultural learning indicators,
1106000	1111000	for me, gave me a lot of inspiration in my writing and teaching.
1111000	1114000	He said how to train yourself,
1114000	1117000	including a comment event,
1117000	1119000	a cultural fairy tale,
1119000	1123000	and how to investigate in a role-play way,
1123000	1128000	as well as the discussion of the values of the target language language culture,
1128000	1130000	cultural understanding and learning,
1130000	1133000	as well as the list of cultural elements.
1133000	1140000	Next, I will briefly introduce the theory of the background of cross-culturalization to you.
1140000	1145000	Then we will enter the concept of the description of my entire textbook.
1145000	1150000	First of all, based on all the cross-culturalization just mentioned,
1150000	1152000	the ability to communicate,
1152000	1155000	and the purpose of reaching a cross-culturalization,
1155000	1159000	we will find that the cross-culturalization comes from two things.
1159000	1162000	The first is that you have to feel comfortable.
1162000	1164000	Language learning has to feel comfortable.
1164000	1168000	The second is that people with goals and countries should feel comfortable and not be offended.
1168000	1172000	So, when I was doing a data collection,
1172000	1174000	I noticed this kind of data collection.
1174000	1175000	Let's take a look.
1175000	1179000	In fact, the whole framework of communication includes so many elements.
1179000	1181000	But in general,
1181000	1185000	the purpose of language learning is to achieve proper communication.
1185000	1186000	But in general,
1186000	1190000	in fact, we will probably pay more attention to this part of the current textbook.
1190000	1193000	But the part of the blue frame, the part of the non-language part,
1193000	1195000	and some cultural parts,
1195000	1197000	the cultural parts of Behavioral,
1197000	1200000	are actually less written for it.
1200000	1205000	Next, let's take a look.
1205000	1208000	So, when I was doing the demand analysis,
1208000	1212000	it was different from the general textbook in terms of data collection.
1212000	1215000	The collection of my textbook
1215000	1223000	will collect a lot of real context and scenes of cross-culturalization.
1223000	1226000	So, I started to do a lot of interviews,
1226000	1231000	and I did an in-depth interview with foreign students who came to Taiwan,
1231000	1233000	and their contacts,
1233000	1237000	including their Chinese teachers and general teachers.
1237000	1239000	Why?
1239000	1242000	Because during my interview,
1242000	1245000	I visited foreign students first.
1245000	1250000	Foreign students think that Chinese teachers are their biggest source of language,
1250000	1256000	or the best resource for all kinds of cultural adaptation.
1256000	1260000	It is also a clear object in their mind.
1260000	1264000	We found that foreign students think that Chinese teachers and general teachers,
1264000	1267000	many of our foreign students do not come to Taiwan to learn Chinese,
1267000	1269000	they may be international students.
1269000	1275000	So, the teachers they come into contact with are not the Chinese teachers who understand different student cultures very well,
1275000	1277000	but the teachers of general science.
1277000	1282000	The teachers of general science may not come into contact with a large number of foreign students,
1282000	1285000	so they often have some communication barriers.
1285000	1290000	So, in fact, there is a big difference between teachers and students.
1290000	1292000	Then there are their roommates,
1292000	1293000	Taiwanese roommates,
1293000	1295000	and some foreign students,
1295000	1297000	they are technical families.
1297000	1302000	So, this is where my main scenario comes from.
1302000	1308000	Next, I would like to quickly share with you my interview with this cross-border group,
1308000	1310000	including these three.
1310000	1312000	I am one of the technical families.
1312000	1314000	This is a resource that you rarely come into contact with,
1314000	1317000	a source of barrier to cultural communication.
1317000	1319000	Let me share with you.
1321000	1324000	This is a technical family's interview question.
1324000	1328000	At the time of my interview, the epidemic broke out in Taiwan.
1328000	1331000	So it's probably all online.
1332000	1337000	At that time, it was usually a family of two or three groups.
1337000	1340000	Sometimes it was a family of one or two groups,
1340000	1342000	depending on the time.
1342000	1344000	In fact, when these families interviewed,
1344000	1349000	they contributed some very rich cases of getting along.
1349000	1354000	And you will find that they often have a lot of common problems,
1354000	1356000	some common problems.
1356000	1359000	So this is the question I asked them.
1359000	1361000	Before the interview,
1361000	1368000	I had already read a lot of articles about the barriers to Chinese culture
1368000	1373000	by foreign students.
1373000	1375000	So when I was leading,
1375000	1378000	I would actually put these,
1378000	1380000	when discussing,
1380000	1382000	when discussing something that is not rich enough,
1382000	1385000	I would also give them some hints
1385000	1388000	to see if they really,
1388000	1391000	really encountered this kind of communication difficulty.
1391000	1393000	That's also a kind of correction.
1393000	1396000	So let's take a look.
1396000	1399000	My question is probably from the technical family itself,
1399000	1401000	his feelings.
1401000	1404000	And then there's his observation.
1404000	1407000	And then there's the reaction of foreign students to him.
1407000	1410000	We interviewed a total of 10 families.
1410000	1414000	A lot of people have even more than 10 years of experience.
1414000	1417000	They have hosted dozens of foreign students.
1417000	1419000	And then they became long-term good friends.
1419000	1423000	It's very rare for them to share this kind of experience.
1423000	1429000	It's very different from what the Chinese teacher said.
1429000	1431000	They are actually more living.
1431000	1434000	In addition, I will also ask them the last question.
1434000	1436000	When we asked the Chinese teacher this question,
1436000	1437000	of course,
1437000	1439000	what do you think can be put in the textbook?
1439000	1441000	Chinese teachers are professional,
1441000	1443000	so their sharing is in place.
1443000	1447000	But I later found that the technical family's sharing is very interesting.
1447000	1450000	It's not quite the same as what our Chinese professor thinks.
1450000	1451000	They think,
1451000	1452000	how come I don't know this,
1452000	1453000	I don't know that.
1453000	1455000	Didn't your teacher teach you?
1455000	1459000	So I later put some of the things they shared
1459000	1462000	into the case I'm going to share today.
1462000	1468000	Okay, so that's probably one of my ways of interviewing.
1468000	1471000	Next, in my interview,
1471000	1473000	a preliminary analysis,
1473000	1476000	we found some very special things.
1476000	1477000	The first is that in fact,
1477000	1482000	foreign students have a great difference in the difficulty of cross-cultural communication,
1482000	1486000	including different countries and different geographical locations.
1486000	1487000	For example,
1487000	1490000	European and American students complain that Taiwan is very hot.
1490000	1492000	Southeast Asian students complain that Taiwan is very cold.
1492000	1495000	That also includes the issue of race.
1495000	1496000	For example,
1496000	1499000	the same issue is the issue of Chinese students in the United States,
1499000	1502000	and the issue of non-Chinese white people,
1502000	1504000	and the issue of people with skin color.
1504000	1506000	The cultural barriers they encounter are very, very different.
1506000	1508000	Of course, it also includes the issue of religion.
1508000	1509000	For example,
1509000	1511000	students with a Christian background
1511000	1515000	find it very difficult to find the real food,
1515000	1516000	and find it very difficult.
1516000	1517000	There is also the issue of gender.
1517000	1521000	For example,
1521000	1524000	male students who are white
1524000	1527000	are often worshipped as idols,
1527000	1531000	or black male students
1531000	1533000	are often asked some very impolite questions
1533000	1538000	in the south-central region,
1538000	1541000	and even asked to touch their hair.
1541000	1543000	Then there is the age difference.
1543000	1546000	Foreign students of different ages
1546000	1549000	also have a great difference in their feelings.
1549000	1552000	So after my interview,
1552000	1554000	I actually have two ideas.
1554000	1555000	The first is that
1555000	1557000	our textbook should show the issue of universality,
1557000	1559000	and also the issue of racial discrimination.
1559000	1561000	So my textbook today
1561000	1564000	is mainly for students with a North American background.
1564000	1565000	Next,
1565000	1568000	this is an analysis of the source of the entire article.
1568000	1570000	So behind it,
1570000	1572000	there is our highest indicator,
1572000	1574000	which is the ability to communicate.
1574000	1575000	Next,
1575000	1578000	I have already found some documents.
1578000	1579000	You probably know
1579000	1581000	the difficulties of cultural adaptation.
1581000	1583000	Next is our interview.
1583000	1585000	It is actually mainly to collect a context,
1585000	1587000	so that our textbooks are more consistent.
1587000	1590000	This is a real context.
1590000	1591000	Next,
1591000	1594000	this set of communication of miniaturized textbooks,
1594000	1598000	the design of miniaturized textbooks,
1598000	1602000	is a starting point for the students themselves.
1602000	1607000	I originally planned to shoot this set of textbooks in Taiwan.
1607000	1608000	Then,
1608000	1610000	I would present it in a video format.
1610000	1612000	Unfortunately,
1612000	1614000	before I came to the United States,
1614000	1616000	the epidemic in Taiwan broke out.
1616000	1618000	So this film was not able to be shot.
1618000	1619000	Later,
1619000	1621000	I changed this kind of textbook
1621000	1624000	to use a large number of pictures to present.
1624000	1631000	So I hope it is a video textbook.
1631000	1632000	Next,
1632000	1635000	it is mainly for miniaturized communication.
1635000	1637000	It is not just a set of textbooks.
1637000	1642000	So it is probably suitable for A2 or above.
1642000	1644000	If you are a second-year student in the United States,
1644000	1647000	you will have some simple Chinese grammar,
1647000	1650000	and then you will have a certain vocabulary ability.
1650000	1652000	Even if he has some vocabulary ability,
1652000	1653000	he will not be able to achieve it.
1653000	1658000	He will also be familiar with the description of the vocabulary we provide.
1658000	1661000	He can learn it by reading it.
1661000	1662000	Next,
1662000	1668000	it is suitable for soldiers who will stay in Taiwan.
1668000	1670000	He will stay in Taiwan for a long time.
1670000	1672000	He is not a tourist,
1672000	1676000	or even a short-term primary school student.
1676000	1680000	Primary school students are very limited in contact with the local area.
1680000	1683000	He may stay in Taiwan for more than half a year.
1683000	1684000	In addition,
1684000	1686000	I hope it is a set suitable for self-study.
1686000	1688000	I think language textbooks
1688000	1691000	need a professional language teacher.
1691000	1693000	A good textbook teaching method.
1693000	1694000	But I think culture,
1694000	1696000	based on a certain level of language,
1696000	1698000	can actually continue.
1698000	1701000	Next,
1701000	1704000	let's talk about this quickly.
1704000	1708000	This is the assessment we may do later.
1708000	1709000	Actually,
1709000	1711000	I haven't done this part yet.
1711000	1713000	Let's skip it.
1713000	1715000	I'm afraid we don't have enough time.
1715000	1717000	Let's take a look now.
1717000	1720000	The design of my entire course structure.
1720000	1722000	What we will see later is not a video.
1722000	1726000	It will be text and pictures.
1726000	1727000	Next,
1727000	1730000	we will provide some interactive questions.
1730000	1734000	The main thing is to promote the cultivation of his cultural ability,
1734000	1737000	including some cultural comparisons and cultural insights.
1737000	1740000	We will ask him in different ways.
1740000	1743000	We will also tell him
1743000	1745000	why it is like this.
1745000	1747000	What is the culture behind him?
1747000	1750000	This part is an analysis of a cultural point.
1750000	1753000	I wrote this part in English.
1753000	1755000	This part is about understanding,
1755000	1758000	not learning the language itself.
1758000	1760000	So we need to let the students know it,
1760000	1762000	and know why.
1762000	1764000	Most students will say,
1764000	1766000	teacher, are you full?
1766000	1768000	We all say that
1768000	1770000	it's good to be taught by a language teacher.
1770000	1772000	But why do I say, teacher, are you full?
1772000	1774000	Why do you have to say hello and eat?
1774000	1775000	If he knows,
1775000	1778000	he will feel more warm.
1778000	1779000	At the end,
1779000	1781000	there will be some discussion and suggestions.
1781000	1783000	If you really feel uncomfortable,
1783000	1786000	how do I express it to him?
1786000	1787000	Next,
1787000	1789000	let's take a look.
1789000	1793000	I collected these cultural points.
1793000	1797000	Actually, I received a lot of these points.
1797000	1800000	But I basically only made four lessons.
1800000	1803000	Two lessons are related to the class.
1803000	1805000	One is the interaction with the teacher.
1805000	1808000	The other is the cultural conflict in the classroom.
1808000	1810000	The second is the general life,
1810000	1814000	including visiting friends and staying in the dormitory.
1814000	1819000	But this dormitory is not a general dormitory.
1819000	1821000	For example,
1821000	1823000	Americans and Americans live in the same dormitory.
1823000	1825000	Frankly speaking, there is no problem.
1825000	1828000	It's amazing that the bathroom looks different,
1828000	1829000	the bed is harder,
1829000	1830000	these things.
1830000	1832000	In fact, there is no communication problem.
1832000	1835000	But if he lives outside,
1835000	1837000	especially with Taiwanese roommates,
1837000	1839000	this conflict is very big.
1839000	1841000	What we are going to share later is
1841000	1844000	the class of visiting friends.
1844000	1845000	I'm sorry,
1845000	1847000	my screen is very blurry.
1847000	1848000	In fact,
1848000	1855000	his speech should appear after the point.
1855000	1856000	The picture will be better.
1856000	1858000	In order to overcome this,
1858000	1859000	I can't make it into a video.
1859000	1863000	So I tried my best to find some pictures that look very blurry.
1863000	1867000	This is the person in the picture.
1867000	1871000	We are going to visit this person and his grandmother.
1871000	1875000	Let's take a look at the development of our course.
1875000	1877000	Jian Ting is Wenjie's good friend in Taiwan.
1877000	1878000	This weekend,
1878000	1881000	Jian Ting invites Wenjie to visit his grandmother.
1881000	1882000	Please note that
1882000	1885000	in our language course,
1885000	1886000	we will call grandma,
1886000	1887000	grandma.
1887000	1888000	We won't call grandma.
1888000	1889000	In fact,
1889000	1894000	our course is designed to target Taiwan as a country.
1894000	1897000	So I believe everyone can understand.
1897000	1898000	In Taiwan,
1898000	1901000	the opportunity to call grandma is much more than to call grandma.
1901000	1903000	So I deliberately put grandma.
1903000	1904000	Why?
1904000	1906000	Because this is also what I received.
1906000	1908000	A student in the south.
1908000	1910000	He learned Chinese very well.
1910000	1913000	But he found that there are many people who don't speak Mandarin in the south.
1913000	1915000	So when he learned Chinese,
1915000	1917000	he went to the southeast.
1917000	1919000	He couldn't order food in the night market.
1919000	1920000	He didn't understand Mandarin.
1920000	1922000	So it caused a cultural problem.
1922000	1924000	So I put him in front of grandma.
1924000	1926000	Then make a simple explanation.
1926000	1927000	Then let's take a look.
1927000	1928000	He said,
1928000	1929000	Hello, nice to meet you.
1929000	1930000	I am Li Wenjie.
1930000	1932000	What is your name?
1932000	1934000	We see that the language teacher is very good.
1934000	1935000	He wants to use honorifics.
1935000	1936000	But he asked grandma,
1936000	1938000	what is your name?
1938000	1940000	Grandma was very suspicious.
1940000	1941000	Why would anyone ask my name?
1941000	1942000	I am Lin Meizhu.
1942000	1943000	Then he said,
1943000	1945000	you can call me grandma like Jian Ting.
1945000	1946000	Then Wenjie said,
1946000	1948000	okay, grandma, hello.
1948000	1949000	Let's take a look.
1949000	1950000	This cultural point,
1950000	1952000	everyone should feel it.
1952000	1953000	He said,
1953000	1954000	please put on slippers.
1954000	1955000	He said,
1955000	1956000	oh, I forgot.
1956000	1957000	I have to take off my shoes.
1957000	1958000	My socks are broken.
1958000	1959000	I'm so sorry.
1959000	1960000	Then Jian Ting said,
1960000	1961000	it doesn't matter.
1961000	1962000	Grandma, this is a gift for you.
1962000	1963000	Open it and take a look.
1963000	1964000	I hope you like it.
1964000	1965000	As a result,
1965000	1966000	grandma said,
1966000	1967000	thank you, you're welcome.
1967000	1969000	Put the gift next to it.
1969000	1970000	Please drink hot tea.
1970000	1972000	Wenjie can't stand it, right?
1972000	1973000	It's so hot.
1973000	1974000	Can you give me a cup of iced tea?
1974000	1975000	Jian Ting said, okay.
1975000	1976000	Then next,
1976000	1978000	grandma asked Jian Ting,
1978000	1979000	you tell Jian Ting,
1979000	1981000	you help me ask Wenjie.
1981000	1983000	Does he have a girlfriend?
1983000	1985000	Grandma wants to introduce him.
1985000	1986000	What did Wenjie say?
1986000	1987000	Grandma, I understand Chinese.
1987000	1989000	You can talk to me directly.
1989000	1990000	Thank you,
1990000	1993000	but I like to find a girlfriend myself.
1993000	1996000	I don't know what you think of this class.
1996000	1998000	I think if there are a lot of Chinese teachers on site,
1998000	1999000	you should have seen
1999000	2002000	how many cultural points there are.
2002000	2003000	Let's take a look.
2003000	2004000	This is what's next.
2004000	2007000	After we provide the text and vocabulary,
2007000	2010000	we're going to take the second step.
2010000	2013000	We're going to have an interactive stimulus.
2013000	2015000	So let's look at this first.
2015000	2017000	Hello, nice to meet you.
2017000	2018000	I'm Li Wenjie.
2018000	2021000	What's your name?
2021000	2024000	This is actually...
2024000	2027000	It's hard for us to tell students.
2027000	2030000	We're interacting in Chinese class, right?
2030000	2031000	What's my name?
2031000	2033000	What's your name?
2033000	2035000	But in real life,
2035000	2037000	when we visit our grandparents in the countryside,
2037000	2040000	we don't seem to be able to ask them
2040000	2041000	what their names are.
2041000	2042000	Right?
2042000	2044000	So here,
2044000	2045000	we have the first question.
2045000	2049000	Do you think Wenjie is a good greeting?
2049000	2052000	This is the first point.
2052000	2056000	Let him have a cultural awareness.
2056000	2058000	So we let him choose.
2058000	2059000	He thinks it's good.
2059000	2061000	That's what all teachers do, right?
2061000	2062000	Next,
2062000	2063000	it might be a little weird.
2063000	2066000	He can't ask his grandparents' names directly.
2066000	2067000	Next,
2067000	2068000	of course,
2068000	2070000	we'll tell him that
2070000	2074000	it's not convenient for us to ask his name directly.
2074000	2077000	We usually stop here.
2077000	2079000	Don't ask your grandparents' names.
2079000	2082000	But students will find it strange.
2082000	2083000	Why can I ask,
2083000	2085000	but he can't?
2085000	2087000	So,
2087000	2089000	we need to look further.
2089000	2091000	We need to know what we want to know.
2091000	2093000	That's how we can reach a deeper understanding.
2093000	2095000	So we use the English term
2095000	2098000	for the greeting culture.
2098000	2099000	Actually,
2099000	2100000	in Chinese,
2100000	2102000	the greeting culture of the Chinese
2102000	2104000	is an ancient culture.
2104000	2107000	It's impolite to ask his name directly.
2107000	2109000	Especially the elders.
2109000	2111000	So you can ask your grandparents' names directly.
2111000	2113000	But the elders can't.
2113000	2114000	They can't.
2114000	2115000	So they might say,
2116000	2118000	or whatever.
2118000	2120000	That's how it usually goes.
2120000	2124000	We can only ask his name.
2124000	2125000	Next,
2125000	2127000	let's look at the second one.
2127000	2128000	He said,
2128000	2131000	you can call me grandma like Jianting.
2131000	2134000	This grandma is kind.
2134000	2135000	Wenjie said,
2135000	2136000	okay,
2136000	2137000	grandma,
2137000	2140000	hello.
2140000	2143000	We see that their elders call them grandma.
2143000	2145000	It's a very intimate thing.
2145000	2148000	But for an American student,
2148000	2151000	I'm afraid he'll feel very uncomfortable.
2151000	2153000	So we ask him,
2153000	2157000	if someone asks you to call someone you just met,
2157000	2158000	this granny,
2158000	2160000	in the American language,
2160000	2163000	granny is really just your grandma.
2163000	2165000	It could also be a good friend.
2165000	2167000	But you have to be familiar.
2167000	2170000	You can't meet an old lady on the road and call her granny.
2170000	2172000	So we ask him how he feels.
2172000	2173000	Take care of his feelings.
2173000	2174000	I think it's good.
2174000	2175000	Very intimate.
2175000	2177000	Or I think it's strange.
2177000	2180000	But we have to bring out this cultural point.
2180000	2181000	Why?
2181000	2183000	Taiwanese people don't call names.
2183000	2184000	In the United States,
2184000	2186000	from old to young,
2186000	2188000	you can call names.
2188000	2189000	No matter how important it is,
2189000	2191000	you can call their names.
2191000	2194000	But we often use family names.
2194000	2196000	Here's another explanation.
2196000	2197000	How do you call people?
2197000	2198000	How do you call people?
2198000	2199000	And then here,
2199000	2201000	you can do a simple cultural practice.
2201000	2202000	A simple cultural practice.
2202000	2204000	In fact, this is because there is no video.
2204000	2205000	If it's a video,
2205000	2206000	you should say,
2206000	2207000	this person,
2207000	2208000	what do you call him?
2208000	2209000	What do you call him?
2209000	2210000	Something like that.
2210000	2211000	Okay.
2211000	2213000	Let's move on.
2213000	2217000	This is just a point of communication.
2217000	2218000	In fact,
2218000	2219000	in this painting,
2219000	2221000	in order to achieve a real woman,
2221000	2223000	I didn't make these cultural points a distinction.
2223000	2225000	What is behavioral culture?
2225000	2227000	What is information culture?
2227000	2228000	That is,
2228000	2230000	based on the scene.
2230000	2232000	Based on the scene of a visit.
2232000	2234000	So what he brought here
2234000	2236000	is an information culture.
2236000	2237000	In Taiwan,
2237000	2240000	it's almost like changing shoes.
2240000	2241000	Of course,
2241000	2243000	we also need to achieve a sense of humor
2243000	2245000	and a sense of
2245000	2247000	a sense of humor
2247000	2249000	and a sense of realism.
2249000	2250000	Right?
2250000	2251000	In the United States,
2251000	2253000	you really don't have to compromise.
2253000	2256000	I'm afraid this kind of embarrassment will happen.
2256000	2257000	So,
2257000	2259000	to increase their understanding.
2259000	2260000	Okay.
2260000	2261000	So,
2261000	2262000	let's start with his own problem.
2262000	2263000	His own culture.
2263000	2265000	Do you compromise when you go home?
2265000	2267000	Do you compromise when you visit a friend's house?
2267000	2268000	Next,
2268000	2269000	if you are asked to go out,
2269000	2271000	how do you feel?
2271000	2272000	And then,
2272000	2273000	can you not compromise?
2273000	2274000	Especially if
2274000	2276000	your socks just have a hole.
2276000	2277000	Can you?
2277000	2279000	How to communicate properly.
2279000	2280000	Next,
2280000	2281000	let's tell him why
2281000	2283000	compromise in Taiwan.
2283000	2284000	In fact,
2284000	2285000	it's not just Taiwan.
2285000	2287000	Most countries compromise.
2287000	2288000	And then,
2288000	2289000	let him judge.
2289000	2290000	This,
2290000	2291000	this feeling,
2291000	2293000	the point where you feel uncomfortable,
2293000	2295000	can it be reflected?
2295000	2296000	But in fact,
2296000	2297000	the result is probably
2297000	2300000	that you can't help but compromise.
2300000	2301000	Okay,
2301000	2302000	so this is an English explanation.
2302000	2303000	Okay,
2303000	2304000	next.
2304000	2305000	Okay,
2305000	2307000	this is the culture of giving gifts.
2307000	2308000	Okay,
2308000	2309000	our culture is the culture of giving gifts.
2309000	2310000	Okay,
2310000	2311000	Americans say,
2311000	2312000	oh,
2312000	2313000	I prepared it for you.
2313000	2314000	Please open it and take a look.
2314000	2315000	Okay,
2315000	2317000	but grandma is an old-fashioned person,
2317000	2318000	right?
2318000	2320000	He's embarrassed to open it in public.
2320000	2321000	Okay,
2321000	2322000	so he said,
2322000	2323000	thank you,
2323000	2324000	you're welcome.
2324000	2325000	I didn't open it.
2325000	2326000	Okay,
2326000	2327000	next,
2327000	2328000	let's see.
2328000	2329000	This is also a foreign student
2329000	2330000	who reflects
2330000	2331000	the culture of giving gifts in Taiwan.
2331000	2332000	Taiwanese also reflect
2332000	2333000	the culture of giving gifts to foreign students.
2333000	2334000	What's behind it?
2334000	2335000	This,
2335000	2336000	foreign students think
2336000	2337000	Taiwanese are generous.
2337000	2338000	There are a lot of gifts
2338000	2339000	for him,
2339000	2340000	very valuable.
2340000	2341000	Taiwanese think
2341000	2342000	foreign students
2342000	2343000	are very stingy.
2343000	2344000	I gave him such an expensive gift.
2344000	2345000	How can he give me
2345000	2348000	such a worthless gift?
2348000	2349000	Okay,
2349000	2350000	as you can see,
2350000	2351000	this is not a matter of generosity,
2351000	2353000	but a matter of cultural difference.
2353000	2354000	So,
2354000	2356000	let's take a quick look here.
2356000	2357000	Okay,
2357000	2358000	uh,
2358000	2361000	he may have a way.
2361000	2362000	Okay,
2362000	2363000	ask him,
2363000	2364000	why do you think
2364000	2365000	the goal of this country's grandma is
2365000	2367000	that she doesn't open it,
2367000	2368000	she just puts it next to it?
2368000	2369000	Okay,
2369000	2370000	and then,
2370000	2372000	it creates a cultural contrast.
2372000	2373000	Here we talk about
2373000	2374000	the Chinese culture
2374000	2376000	as a sign of sincerity
2376000	2378000	to give gifts.
2378000	2379000	But,
2379000	2380000	in the United States,
2380000	2381000	he may really be
2381000	2383000	a kind person.
2383000	2384000	Uh,
2384000	2385000	what did you do?
2385000	2386000	Uh,
2386000	2387000	even,
2387000	2388000	uh,
2388000	2389000	give a bouquet,
2389000	2390000	which is a very good gift.
2390000	2391000	His main expression
2391000	2392000	is the part of that friendship.
2392000	2393000	So,
2393000	2394000	it will cause a political difference
2394000	2395000	between the two sides
2395000	2396000	in giving gifts.
2396000	2397000	It caused a misunderstanding,
2397000	2398000	uh,
2398000	2399000	caused a kind of,
2399000	2400000	uh,
2400000	2401000	a misunderstanding in this understanding.
2401000	2402000	Okay,
2402000	2403000	next,
2403000	2404000	we will talk about
2404000	2405000	some details
2405000	2406000	in the Chinese culture
2406000	2407000	of giving gifts.
2407000	2408000	Then,
2408000	2409000	this cultural point
2409000	2410000	will lead to
2410000	2411000	the culture of giving gifts.
2411000	2412000	Okay,
2412000	2413000	I want to
2413000	2414000	finish it as soon as possible.
2414000	2415000	Uh,
2415000	2416000	next,
2416000	2417000	like,
2417000	2418000	for example,
2418000	2419000	drinking iced tea,
2419000	2420000	this kind of thing,
2420000	2421000	do you really have to be patient
2421000	2422000	to completely ignore
2422000	2423000	your own culture?
2423000	2424000	In fact,
2424000	2425000	not necessarily.
2425000	2426000	For example,
2426000	2427000	drinking water,
2427000	2428000	you really don't want to drink hot water.
2428000	2429000	Uh,
2429000	2430000	you can actually say,
2430000	2431000	you don't want to drink cold water.
2431000	2432000	Okay,
2432000	2433000	okay,
2433000	2434000	next,
2434000	2435000	this is a,
2435000	2436000	I am,
2436000	2437000	I am,
2437000	2438000	uh,
2438000	2439000	I have collected all of these,
2439000	2440000	uh,
2440000	2441000	uh,
2441000	2442000	these,
2442000	2443000	uh,
2443000	2444000	it should be said that
2444000	2445000	I did not collect this
2445000	2446000	in the academic paper,
2446000	2447000	but when I did this,
2447000	2448000	I was later in,
2448000	2449000	uh,
2449000	2450000	a U.S. election,
2450000	2451000	when I handed this out,
2451000	2452000	there was a student
2452000	2453000	who was almost
2453000	2454000	saying that
2454000	2455000	really,
2455000	2456000	when I was in Taiwan,
2456000	2457000	I encountered
2457000	2458000	a point that
2459000	2460000	was very special.
2460000	2461000	This is really,
2461000	2462000	this is,
2462000	2463000	he,
2463000	2464000	especially the two
2464000	2465000	foreign students
2465000	2466000	who shared it,
2466000	2467000	they shared it very vividly,
2467000	2468000	they were very unhappy
2468000	2469000	and very angry that
2469000	2470000	he was obviously
2470000	2471000	good at English,
2471000	2472000	he was good at Chinese,
2472000	2473000	he just didn't talk to me,
2473000	2474000	he just wanted to talk to me
2474000	2475000	through that person.
2475000	2476000	Okay,
2476000	2477000	let's take a look at
2477000	2478000	these,
2478000	2479000	these will all
2479000	2480000	have some explanations
2480000	2481000	why
2481000	2482000	Chinese is indirectly
2482000	2483000	transmitted.
2483000	2484000	Is it rude?
2484000	2485000	Or is it
2485000	2486000	bullying you?
2486000	2487000	Maybe not,
2487000	2488000	maybe sometimes
2488000	2489000	it's about
2489000	2490000	respect for that person,
2490000	2491000	respect for the person who introduced him,
2491000	2492000	maybe sometimes
2492000	2493000	he's just
2493000	2494000	shy.
2494000	2495000	Okay,
2495000	2496000	then I think
2496000	2497000	we'll start
2497000	2498000	with the
2498000	2499000	textbook sharing
2499000	2500000	here.
2500000	2501000	Okay,
2501000	2502000	then later,
2502000	2503000	I put these
2503000	2504000	four courses
2504000	2505000	in the
2505000	2506000	University of
2506000	2507000	the United States
2507000	2508000	as a
2508000	2509000	working method
2509000	2510000	for
2510000	2511000	this
2511000	2512000	Chinese learner,
2512000	2513000	and then
2513000	2514000	to a
2514000	2515000	certain
2515000	2516000	level of Chinese,
2516000	2517000	and then
2517000	2518000	this
2518000	2519000	feedback is
2519000	2520000	very good,
2520000	2521000	very good.
2521000	2522000	Some of them
2522000	2523000	have been to Taiwan,
2523000	2524000	and even
2524000	2525000	those who have been to
2525000	2526000	Taiwan,
2526000	2527000	I personally
2527000	2528000	interviewed them
2528000	2529000	again,
2529000	2530000	they felt
2530000	2531000	that
2531000	2532000	they felt
2532000	2533000	in place,
2533000	2534000	so
2534000	2535000	I was
2535000	2536000	very confident
2536000	2537000	in
2537000	2538000	writing
2538000	2539000	this
2539000	2540000	textbook,
2540000	2541000	so
2541000	2542000	I can
2542000	2543000	probably
2543000	2544000	continue to
2544000	2545000	write
2545000	2546000	this
2546000	2547000	textbook.
2547000	2548000	Okay,
2548000	2549000	then I
2549000	2550000	will
2550000	2551000	move on
2551000	2552000	to the
2552000	2553000	next
2553000	2554000	discussion
2554000	2555000	topic,
2555000	2556000	which
2556000	2557000	is,
2557000	2558000	uh,
2558000	2559000	does
2559000	2560000	cross-cultural
2560000	2561000	teaching
2561000	2562000	require
2562000	2563000	nationalization
2563000	2564000	design?
2564000	2565000	Because
2565000	2566000	C1 to
2566000	2567000	C2
2567000	2568000	are
2568000	2569000	not
2569000	2570000	equal,
2570000	2571000	right?
2571000	2572000	Okay,
2572000	2573000	next,
2573000	2574000	cross-cultural
2574000	2575000	teaching
2575000	2576000	design.
2576000	2577000	Thank you,
2577000	2578000	Dai Ping.
2578000	2579000	It's really
2579000	2580000	very interesting.
2580000	2581000	I don't
2581000	2582000	know
2582000	2583000	if
2583000	2584000	anyone
2584000	2585000	at the
2585000	2586000	scene
2586000	2587000	has any
2587000	2588000	questions
2588000	2589000	for the
2589000	2590000	audience?
2590000	2591000	Yes,
2591000	2592000	or
2592000	2593000	do you have
2593000	2594000	any suggestions?
2594000	2595000	I believe
2595000	2596000	if there are
2596000	2597000	Chinese
2597000	2598000	teachers
2598000	2599000	or
2599000	2600000	learners
2600000	2601000	at the
2601000	2602000	scene,
2602000	2603000	they
2603000	2604000	can
2604000	2605000	share
2605000	2606000	their
2606000	2607000	thoughts
2607000	2608000	and
2608000	2609000	experiences
2609000	2610000	with
2610000	2611000	the
2611000	2612000	audience.
2612000	2613000	I
2613000	2614000	think
2614000	2615000	it's
2615000	2616000	very
2616000	2617000	important
2617000	2618000	to
2618000	2619000	share
2619000	2620000	your
2620000	2621000	thoughts
2621000	2622000	and
2622000	2623000	experiences
2623000	2624000	with
2624000	2625000	the
2625000	2626000	audience.
2626000	2627000	I
2627000	2628000	think
2628000	2629000	it's
2629000	2630000	very
2630000	2631000	important
2631000	2632000	to
2632000	2633000	share
2633000	2634000	your
2634000	2635000	thoughts
2635000	2636000	and
2636000	2637000	experiences
2637000	2638000	with
2638000	2639000	the
2639000	2640000	audience.
2640000	2641000	I
2641000	2642000	think
2642000	2643000	it's
2643000	2644000	very
2644000	2645000	important
2645000	2646000	to
2646000	2647000	share

2651000	2652000	with
2652000	2653000	the
2653000	2654000	audience.
2654000	2655000	Thank
2655000	2656000	you.
2656000	2657000	Thank
2657000	2658000	you.
2658000	2659000	Thank
2659000	2660000	you.
2690000	2691000	Thank
2691000	2692000	you.
2692000	2693000	Thank
2693000	2694000	you.
2694000	2695000	Thank
2695000	2696000	you.
2696000	2697000	My
2697000	2698000	next
2698000	2719000	question
2719000	2738000	is
2738000	2763000	about
2824000	2826000	Internet
2826000	2830000	connections.
2853000	2861000	Yes, but I think this paper mainly focuses on the feelings of the local people, the goal and the country.
2861000	2866000	We usually collect the feelings of our second language learners.
2866000	2871000	Yes, but in fact, this will produce a big blind spot.
2871000	2878000	That is, he does not know that his own language behavior is causing the other party's discomfort.
2878000	2880000	Oh, okay.
2880000	2888000	Yes, so what I received this time was, for example, the technical family and their roommates.
2888000	2893000	In addition to the foreign students, in fact, their feedback is very, very rich.
2893000	2898000	At this moment, I did not see the complaints part.
2898000	2901000	In fact, I have a lot of complaints.
2901000	2906000	For example, he blamed his American roommates for not turning off the lights and air conditioning.
2906000	2912000	But in fact, I know that this is because of the overall difference in life.
2912000	2916000	In the United States, everyone really does not turn off the lights and air conditioning.
2916000	2918000	He is not particularly wasteful.
2918000	2924000	Yes, so there are some differences in the environment behind him that cause such a difference.
2924000	2927000	But it will cause a barrier to cultural communication.
2927000	2933000	For example, American students will be labeled as wasteful or something.
2933000	2936000	Because in the United States, there is really no need to turn off the lights and air conditioning.
2936000	2938000	For example, they must turn on the air conditioning in winter.
2938000	2940000	Otherwise, it will freeze, right?
2940000	2941000	Yes, yes.
2941000	2944000	And in the end, just adjust the temperature.
2944000	2946000	It's not particularly a waste of electricity.
2946000	2948000	Yes, it's like this.
2948000	2952000	So it's because the environment in Taiwan itself is different, so it's incomprehensible.
2952000	2956000	Yes, but if you let American students know,
2956000	2962000	he can at least have a chance to explain that if he forgets, it's because of me.
2962000	2968000	In this case, it's not easy to create a barrier to communication.
2968000	2972000	Or it's a kind of stereotype.
2972000	2974000	Okay, thank you.
2974000	2976000	Thank you.
2980000	2988000	I think your research has discussed many aspects of cultural communication.
2988000	2991000	I was thinking about this.
2991000	2998000	Because there are many aspects of culture that are difficult to explain directly.
2998000	3001000	For example, we have L1 and L2 transfer.
3001000	3005000	You can say which is positive transfer and which is negative transfer.
3005000	3008000	You can compare and see which is which.
3008000	3012000	Because culture is also a different distance, a different understanding.
3012000	3014000	I don't know if there is...
3014000	3020000	Because I feel like I'm learning another culture.
3020000	3022000	And I feel like there are a lot of...
3022000	3026000	From the most basic, face-to-face, to visit someone.
3026000	3033000	You have a lot of interactions that don't seem to go well.
3033000	3036000	Yes, and then I think, wow, how can I finish learning like this?
3036000	3038000	And then I think, is there...
3038000	3042000	I don't know if this is practical or useful.
3042000	3045000	For example, C1, Cultural 1 transfer.
3045000	3049000	Is there a place where they can say, this is actually...
3049000	3051000	Increase awareness.
3051000	3054000	I think your question will increase a lot of intercultural awareness.
3054000	3056000	But I don't know if it will help them.
3056000	3058000	Oh, this is...
3058000	3060000	I don't know.
3060000	3063000	Which ones are similar and which ones are really different?
3063000	3066000	Yes, you see, language ability is very good at measuring, right?
3066000	3068000	And the test knows where you are.
3068000	3070000	OPI does it and you know where the language ability is.
3070000	3072000	But cultural ability is really hard to measure.
3072000	3074000	And language ability is not equal to cultural ability.
3074000	3076000	We see some people.
3076000	3079000	His Chinese is not very good, but he is very good at communicating.
3079000	3081000	But his communication is very solid, right?
3081000	3085000	That may be a kind of self-awareness.
3085000	3087000	Or his own attitude.
3087000	3090000	He himself has a respect for the goal language culture.
3090000	3093000	Like and his open heart.
3093000	3097000	So in fact, I think this part of cultural learning.
3097000	3101000	His variability is greater.
3101000	3103000	Really big.
3103000	3105000	And there are a lot of points to learn.
3105000	3107000	So that's why I think.
3107000	3109000	I also want to ask everyone to share.
3109000	3111000	Do you think cultural learning is suitable for self-learning?
3111000	3113000	Plus the combination of the media now.
3113000	3115000	He is very diverse.
3115000	3117000	He is very diverse.
3117000	3119000	Then it's okay.
3119000	3121000	Then the length is not the same.
3121000	3123000	We are online teaching materials.
3123000	3125000	We don't need to be limited by time.
3125000	3127000	So I am completely based on the situation.
3127000	3129000	Where should this situation go?
3129000	3131000	Where is it?
3131000	3133000	What are the points of this situation?
3133000	3135000	Let it happen naturally.
3135000	3137000	Then there is the description of the whole situation.
3137000	3139000	I am very grateful to my audience.
3139000	3141000	My situation is actually from their narrative.
3141000	3143000	Of course, you have to sort it out more smoothly.
3143000	3145000	More interesting.
3145000	3147000	Something like that.
3147000	3149000	So I am talking about myself.
3149000	3151000	I am talking about the direction of writing a new textbook.
3151000	3153000	Is this really helpful?
3153000	3155000	The purpose of communication.
3155000	3157000	I can understand you.
3157000	3159000	Do you think this textbook direction is reasonable?
3159000	3161000	I think you wrote that.
3161000	3163000	Because you want to use the way of the film.
3163000	3165000	Because I think this intercultural experience.
3165000	3167000	Communication failure.
3167000	3169000	Such an experience.
3169000	3171000	I think it is an experiential learning.
3171000	3173000	But because of this.
3173000	3175000	I think it is a good experience.
3175000	3177000	I think it is a good experience.
3177000	3179000	Experiential learning.
3179000	3181000	Because if you are not experienced.
3181000	3183000	It is difficult to understand.
3183000	3185000	This is very common.
3185000	3187000	This is very common.
3187000	3189000	Or specific cases.
3189000	3191000	Sometimes you feel.
3191000	3193000	This is really like this.
3193000	3195000	If it is really a different culture.
3195000	3197000	So I think if you use a film.
3197000	3199000	You can see some.
3199000	3201000	You can't say it with blood or photos.
3201000	3203000	Because you have written.
3203000	3205000	Facial expression.
3205000	3207000	You can't feel these.
3207000	3209000	You can't feel these.
3209000	3211000	For example, pauses.
3211000	3213000	Feedback to pauses.
3213000	3215000	Feedback to pauses.
3215000	3217000	That is very important.
3217000	3219000	That is invisible.
3219000	3221000	That is really.
3221000	3223000	Verbal.
3223000	3225000	That is the most difficult.
3225000	3227000	It must rely on the film.
3227000	3229000	I received a lot of.
3229000	3231000	Internet celebrities in Taiwan.
3231000	3233000	Their films are very interesting.
3233000	3235000	But they must be their own feelings.
3235000	3237000	Take it as a film.
3237000	3239000	It is more like a gradual progress.
3239000	3241000	Or some behind the scenes.
3241000	3243000	Excitement.
3243000	3245000	It means that everyone is watching very lively.
3245000	3247000	Of course, I also learned some things.
3247000	3249000	But you see it.
3249000	3251000	It is very suitable for self-study.
3251000	3253000	I think it is very suitable for self-study.
3253000	3255000	I think it is very suitable for self-study.
3255000	3257000	Because they have to have that.
3257000	3259000	If there is no environment.
3259000	3261000	No real contact with the locals.
3261000	3263000	No way to understand.
3263000	3265000	This is a communication.
3265000	3267000	This is a communication failure.
3267000	3269000	This is a communication failure.
3269000	3271000	I think you have collected information.
3271000	3273000	I think you have collected information.
3273000	3275000	For example, his technical family.

3455000	3457000	I want to say
3457000	3459000	You can always make it look like
3459000	3461000	But I gave up
3461000	3463000	Because it's really hard to be exactly the same
3463000	3465000	Then just don't
3465000	3467000	Just don't
3467000	3469000	Just have to shoot in place
3469000	3471000	Yes

3473000	3475000	If there is
3475000	3477000	If there is
3477000	3479000	For example, when you finish writing
3479000	3481000	Because you are still
3481000	3483000	I don't plan to finish writing
3483000	3485000	Because it's just a few lessons
3485000	3487000	Yes, just a few lessons
3487000	3489000	Then slowly expand
3489000	3491000	That's it
