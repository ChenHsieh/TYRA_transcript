0	5000	Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.
5000	10000	Taira is a friendly environment for young Taiwanese researchers,
10000	14000	and we hold Taira Talk every weekend throughout the year.
14000	17000	The format and content of this speech are very free and diverse,
17000	20000	and academic researchers can come here to share their achievements
20000	23000	based on their own qualifications, practice online lectures,
23000	25000	or get to know future potential researchers.
26000	32000	Please join the audience on the right.
41000	46000	Today's speaker is Yan Zhiyun.
46000	50000	She is currently a PhD student at Paul Glincher University of New York,
50000	53000	Professor of Neuroscience and Economics.
53000	57000	Her main research focus is on collecting long-term data
57000	60000	from mobile apps to explore the relationship between
60000	63000	individual daily activities and their risks and time preferences.
63000	66000	Today's speech is a part of the data sharing.
66000	70000	The results of today's sharing have already been reviewed in the first round,
70000	72000	and are currently being reviewed,
72000	74000	so she welcomes any suggestions and ideas.
74000	77000	If there are any questions during the speech,
77000	80000	she can interrupt, right?
80000	85000	Yes, you can interrupt or ask questions if you don't understand.
85000	89000	Yan Zhiyun, I'll leave the next part to you.
89000	92000	Let me share the screen.
102000	105000	Okay, good.
106000	110000	Do you understand?
110000	113000	I don't know why I suddenly have echo.
113000	116000	Do you still have it now?
116000	119000	No, I don't think so.
119000	122000	The topic of my speech today is
128000	132000	First of all, thank you everyone for coming to this event.
132000	135000	The topic of my speech today is
135000	138000	what my PhD thesis is doing.
140000	143000	We all know that risk and uncertainty
143000	148000	are closely related to many of our choices in our lives.
148000	151000	For example, whether to get vaccinated.
151000	154000	In Taiwan, we don't think it's risky to get vaccinated.
154000	157000	But in the US,
157000	160000	many people don't want to get vaccinated because they think it's dangerous.
160000	163000	Or in another domain,
163000	166000	for example, do you want to invest in virtual currency?
166000	169000	These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.
169000	172000	These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.
172000	175000	So a person's preference for taking risks
175000	178000	So a person's preference for taking risks
178000	181000	actually greatly affects whether he is willing to make these decisions.
181000	184000	So when we researchers study,
184000	187000	we put this concept
187000	190000	a person's individual willingness
190000	193000	to make this kind of risky choice
193000	196000	called risk preference or risk additivity.
196000	199000	a person's individual willingness to make this kind of risky choice
199000	202000	called risk preference or risk additivity.
202000	205000	Whether it's economics or psychology,
205000	208000	we usually think of risk preference
208000	211000	as a more stable psychological trait.
211000	214000	as a more stable psychological trait.
215000	218000	There will be differences between individuals.
218000	221000	But more and more research shows that
221000	224000	our risk preferences are actually between individuals.
224000	227000	There will be systematic changes.
227000	230000	There will be systematic changes.
230000	233000	It's very dynamic.
233000	236000	So we want to know
236000	239000	what kind of factors will cause
239000	242000	whether it's between individuals or within individuals
242000	245000	So in the past,
245000	248000	our gender is a factor.
248000	251000	Our gender is a factor.
251000	254000	In the past,
254000	257000	women are usually more at risk
257000	260000	in terms of financial risk.
260000	263000	Women are usually more at risk in terms of financial risk.
263000	266000	Or older people are more at risk
266000	269000	in terms of financial risk.
269000	272000	Research also shows that
272000	275000	if you have a good cognitive ability,
275000	278000	you are more willing to take some risks.
278000	281000	you are more willing to take some risks.
281000	284000	Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.
284000	287000	Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.
287000	290000	If you are a person with anxiety,
290000	293000	If you are a person with anxiety,
293000	296000	you are usually associated with risk avoidance.
296000	299000	you are usually associated with risk avoidance.
299000	302000	you are usually associated with risk avoidance.
302000	305000	This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.
305000	308000	This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.
308000	311000	There are many factors that cause it.
311000	314000	For example,
314000	317000	human or animal research shows
317000	320000	that your metabolic state
320000	323000	that your metabolic state
323000	326000	may affect your risk preference,
326000	329000	may affect your risk preference,
329000	332000	but in a relatively short time scale.
332000	335000	In fact, the good or bad weather
335000	338000	may also affect your level of risk acceptance.
338000	341000	There is a more interesting study
341000	344000	that says that if the weather is pretty good today,
344000	347000	that says that if the weather is pretty good today,
347000	350000	this is a study done in New York City,
350000	353000	the probability of buying a lottery ticket is also higher.
353000	356000	This is an incidental good news.
356000	359000	This is an incidental good news.
359000	362000	It's not as if you think the weather is good today,
362000	365000	so you feel good.
365000	368000	So you are willing to do something
368000	371000	that you think will make you feel better about these risks.
371000	374000	So you are willing to do something that you think will make you feel better about these risks.
374000	377000	For example, buying lottery tickets.
377000	380000	Of course, there are other studies that point out
380000	383000	of course, there are other studies that point out
383000	386000	that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,
386000	389000	that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,
389000	392000	people became more risk averse to investment.
392000	395000	people became more risk averse to investment.
395000	398000	This is a major life event
398000	401000	that affects your level of risk acceptance.
401000	404000	So there are many different factors
404000	407000	that affect your level of risk acceptance.
407000	410000	that affect your level of risk acceptance.
410000	413000	So we can find that the topic of risk aversion
413000	416000	So we can find that the topic of risk aversion
416000	419000	is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.
419000	422000	is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.
422000	425000	And it's been studied for decades.
425000	428000	And in all these years of research,
428000	431000	you find that there are so many different factors
431000	434000	that affect the so-called risk aversion.
434000	437000	that affect the so-called risk aversion.
437000	440000	It's actually very difficult to know
440000	443000	a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.
443000	446000	a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.
446000	449000	a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.
449000	452000	So what my PhD thesis mainly wants to study
452000	455000	is how to put all the factors together
455000	458000	is how to put all the factors together
458000	461000	So we have two main goals.
461000	464000	So we have two main goals.
464000	467000	The first is to establish a data-driven
467000	470000	domain general risk preference ontology.
470000	473000	domain general risk preference ontology.
473000	476000	So this concept is to give a more comprehensive definition
476000	479000	of risk attitude or risk preference.
479000	482000	of risk attitude or risk preference.
482000	485000	So compared to the past,
485000	488000	the most recent research is usually a single
488000	491000	risk measure or a single survey or a single
491000	494000	task developed by economists.
494000	497000	task developed by economists.
497000	500000	So in our experiment,
500000	503000	we not only use a single risk attitude measure,
503000	506000	we not only use a single risk attitude measure,
506000	509000	we use a survey and task-based measure.
509000	512000	we use a survey and task-based measure.
512000	515000	We also include a lot of different psychological traits,
515000	518000	We also include a lot of different psychological traits,
518000	521000	such as your cognitive ability,
521000	524000	such as your cognitive ability,
524000	527000	demographic data,
527000	530000	mental well-being and personality.
530000	533000	mental well-being and personality.
533000	536000	We put all these things together
536000	539000	We put all these things together
539000	542000	and we did a PCA,
542000	545000	and we did a PCA,
545000	548000	which is the Principle Component Analysis,
548000	551000	which is the Principle Component Analysis,
551000	554000	to determine what the covariance is between these
554000	557000	to determine what the covariance is between these
557000	560000	traits related to risk preference in the past.
560000	563000	traits related to risk preference in the past.
563000	566000	And then we want to know
566000	569000	and these things usually only measured once,
569000	572000	but we will do a repeated measurement,
572000	575000	but we will do a repeated measurement,
575000	578000	and we will do a longitudinal experiment.
578000	581000	And we will have a chance to get
581000	584000	more static and dynamic risk preference.
584000	587000	more static and dynamic risk preference.
587000	590000	When we have the ability to make a more comprehensive
590000	593000	definition of risk preference,
593000	596000	we want to know if the environmental state
596000	599000	and the state of life of the victim
599000	602000	will affect the change of risk preference.
602000	605000	will affect the change of risk preference.
605000	608000	will affect the change of risk preference.
608000	611000	So, in the end,
611000	614000	we hope to establish
614000	617000	whether there are any risk preferences
617000	620000	in his life.
620000	623000	and whether there's a significant correlation
623000	626000	with the risk preferences we measured.
626000	629000	with the risk preferences we measured.
629000	632000	with the risk preferences we measured.
632000	635000	with the risk preferences we measured.
635000	638000	These are the two things I'd like to do.
638000	641000	These are the two things I'd like to do.
641000	644000	Next, I will introduce how we do this experiment.
644000	647000	Overall, we collected a lot of different
647000	650000	So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys
650000	653000	So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys
653000	656000	So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys
656000	659000	and two main economic choice tasks.
659000	662000	and two main economic choice tasks.
662000	665000	We measured demographic characteristics,
665000	668000	cognitive ability, mental health, and personality.
668000	671000	cognitive ability, mental health, and personality.
671000	674000	These are all factors that have been proven by past experiments.
674000	677000	We put them all together and measured them.
677000	680000	We conducted eight weeks of tests.
680000	683000	These surveyors did a total of 93 instruments.
683000	686000	These surveyors did a total of 93 instruments.
686000	689000	In these eight weeks, they did experiments every day.
689000	692000	In these eight weeks, they did experiments every day.

704000	707000	The different colors on the top are the surveys
707000	710000	The different colors on the top are the surveys
710000	713000	that have been measured many times.
713000	716000	For example, we measured your anxiety,
716000	719000	For example, we measured your anxiety,
719000	722000	and your personal health questions.
722000	725000	and your personal health questions.
725000	728000	This is related to depression.
729000	732000	This is related to depression.
732000	735000	intertemporal task

753000	756000	I will talk more about these tasks.
756000	759000	I will also talk about the activity tracker.
759000	762000	We do a one-time schedule.
762000	765000	We do a one-time schedule.
765000	768000	We do it every day for eight weeks.
768000	771000	We do it every day for eight weeks.
771000	774000	We try to make them do it every day for less than three minutes.
774000	777000	We divide the longer schedule into several days.
777000	780000	We divide the longer schedule into several days.
780000	783000	They only do it once,
783000	786000	but some of them will be divided into smaller documents.
786000	789000	but some of them will be divided into smaller documents.

1165000	1168000	We also use these parameters
1168000	1171000	to feed the risk-choice models
1171000	1174000	to our data.
1174000	1177000	We also use these parameters
1177000	1180000	to feed the risk-choice models
1180000	1183000	to our data.
1183000	1186000	We use these parameters
1186000	1189000	to create our model
1190000	1193000	to create our model
1193000	1196000	We use these parameters
1196000	1199000	to create our model
1207000	1210000	We use these parameters
1210000	1213000	to create our model
1213000	1216000	to create our model
1216000	1219000	This allows us to know
1219000	1223000	what the parameterb
1223000	1225000	or what the parameter's expectation is
1225000	1228000	You can think of these alpha parameters
1228000	1231000	as based on the alpha parameters
1231000	1234000	in EXPECT UDILY model
1234000	1236000	Since we have such a model
1236000	1240000	we fit it into a single logistic function
1240000	1243000	with maximum likelyness
1243000	1246000	The gamma parameters are used to measure
1246000	1250000	the choice of noise in the task
1250000	1254000	So we include these parameters
1254000	1257000	in the variables I just mentioned
1257000	1260000	alpha, m, and gamma parameters
1260000	1263000	So this is what we have
1263000	1265000	Let me talk about it a little bit
1265000	1269000	There are also these model fitting parts
1269000	1274000	Let's talk about our test subjects
1274000	1279000	We have a total of 123 test subjects
1279000	1282000	They are found in the CrackList
1282000	1287000	and in NYU's Psychology Research Participant System
1287000	1289000	But most of them are from CrackList
1289000	1292000	So most of them are not students
1292000	1296000	Out of the 123 test subjects
1296000	1299000	there are a lot of people who have completed the whole experiment
1299000	1301000	This is a two-month experiment
1301000	1303000	but there are still a lot of people who have completed it
1303000	1306000	So we have a pretty high compliance rate
1306000	1309000	and there are 115 subjects who have completed all the experiments
1309000	1314000	We exclude some subjects
1314000	1317000	because from their choice
1317000	1320000	we know that they don't seem to be doing the experiment seriously
1320000	1323000	Or they did some very irrational behavior in our task
1323000	1326000	This is also one of the criteria for excluding test subjects
1326000	1329000	In the end, we include a total of 96 test subjects
1329000	1332000	in our final analysis
1332000	1337000	So next I'm going to introduce
1337000	1342000	the result of our PCA
1342000	1345000	The result of this PCA
1345000	1350000	is that we used the four principal components
1351000	1354000	to represent all of our data
1354000	1357000	The four components in the front
1357000	1362000	contain a total of 46% of all variances
1362000	1367000	Let's talk about the risk-choice ratio
1367000	1371000	In fact, we are repeatedly measuring
1371000	1374000	So we have a lot of risk-choice ratios
1374000	1379000	So before we created this PCA
1379000	1382000	we used the mean value to represent
1382000	1385000	the tasks that have been measured many times
1385000	1390000	Then it is represented by their average value
1390000	1393000	So in this table
1393000	1400000	I have colored it
1400000	1404000	The loading in this PCA is greater than 0.2
1404000	1407000	So it means that in this principal component
1407000	1410000	these variables are more important
1410000	1413000	We can find that
1413000	1416000	mainly in the first principal component
1416000	1419000	It mainly contains these tables
1419000	1422000	related to mood and mental wellness
1422000	1427000	and impulsivity
1427000	1430000	which is the UPPS document
1430000	1433000	and intolerance of uncertainty
1434000	1437000	In fact, the intolerance of uncertainty
1437000	1440000	is measured by the psychiatrists' table
1440000	1443000	to measure the degree of uncertainty
1443000	1446000	of a person
1446000	1449000	They often use this table
1449000	1452000	to relate to anxiety and depression
1452000	1455000	So we can find that
1455000	1458000	the table designed by the psychiatrists
1458000	1461000	is more related to the anxiety
1461000	1464000	and depression
1464000	1467000	The table designed by the psychiatrists
1467000	1470000	is more related to the anxiety
1470000	1473000	and depression
1473000	1476000	We can find that
1476000	1479000	the table designed by people in different fields
1479000	1482000	is more related to the anxiety and depression
1482000	1485000	We can find that
1485000	1488000	The second principle component
1488000	1492000	is the tasks designed by economists
1492000	1495000	is the tasks designed by economists
1495000	1498000	It mainly contains
1498000	1503000	the variables in the second principle component
1503000	1506000	It mainly contains the variables in the second principle component
1506000	1509000	We can find that
1509000	1512000	in this survey
1512000	1515000	we can find that
1515000	1518000	there are common variables in the second principle component
1518000	1521000	we can find that
1521000	1524000	there are common variables in the second principle component
1524000	1527000	We can talk about it
1527000	1530000	In fact, there is a big debate in the research of risk bias
1530000	1533000	Is it a survey
1533000	1536000	or a game designed by economists
1536000	1539000	The measured risk bias is your real risk bias
1539000	1542000	A part of the research is actually discussing
1542000	1545000	which measurement is more reliable
1545000	1548000	which measurement is more reliable
1548000	1551000	which measurement is more general
1551000	1554000	to measure the so-called risk performance
1554000	1557000	There is a debate
1557000	1560000	However, we found that the survey and the task
1560000	1563000	However, we found that the survey and the task
1563000	1566000	are highly related
1566000	1569000	It is worth noting that
1569000	1572000	the task is related to financial risk
1572000	1575000	the task is related to financial risk
1575000	1578000	Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money
1578000	1581000	Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money
1581000	1584000	The other related is the risk to health
1584000	1587000	The other related is the risk to health
1587000	1590000	and the risk to safety
1590000	1593000	Recreation is less related
1593000	1596000	Recreation is the relation of others
1596000	1599000	Recreation is the relation of others
1599000	1602000	It is not so closely related
1602000	1605000	The third and fourth are the remaining variants
1605000	1608000	The third and fourth are the remaining variants
1608000	1611000	The third is the ver Komponent
1611000	1614000	This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task
1614000	1617000	The fourth is the current variance
1617000	1620000	This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task
1621000	1626000	This mainly in the third Principal Komponent
1626000	1629000	This mainly in the third Principal Komponent
1629000	1638000	This mainly in the third Principal Komponent
1638000	1645000	This principle Komponent is used as a single vector
1645000	1648000	This principle Komponent is used as a single vector
1648000	1654000	to build dynamic risk preference ontology.
1654000	1661000	How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?
1661000	1663000	How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?
1663000	1669000	The way is
1669000	1676000	These models are model-free variables and model-based variables.
1676000	1684000	These variables have a relatively large loading in PCA3.
1684000	1689000	So we use these loading.
1689000	1693000	I just said that when we create this PCA,
1693000	1696000	we actually use the mean value.
1696000	1700000	So what we're going to do is
1700000	1709000	we're going to take the different 8-week data
1709000	1721000	and represent the different 8-week risk additive-related variables.
1721000	1726000	We do metric multiplication.
1726000	1735000	Let each indicator have a different risk additive score every week.
1735000	1740000	After the multiplication, each indicator will have 8.
1740000	1742000	We have a total of 96 indicators.
1742000	1746000	So there are 96 indicators and 8 data points for each indicator.
1746000	1752000	So it will become a matrix of 8 times 96.
1753000	1760000	Then we get the weekly risk component score.
1760000	1766000	One thing to remember is that
1766000	1773000	a relatively low risk component score indicates a higher risk tolerance.
1773000	1779000	A relatively low risk score means that you are more willing to take risks.
1779000	1785000	This is actually just the relationship of positive and negative numbers in math.
1785000	1789000	So you just need to remember this kind of relationship.
1789000	1793000	What we're going to do is,
1793000	1796000	like I just said, how do we put our goal 1 and goal 2 together?
1796000	1802000	We want to see how the risk component score of these 8 data points
1802000	1817000	is related to the different 8-week sleeping time duration and working time duration.
1817000	1820000	So we want to know, for example,
1820000	1830000	whether the total length of sleep at T-1 will affect the current T-1 risk component score.
1830000	1833000	At the same time, we also want to know,
1833000	1842000	for example, the relationship between the previous week's risk component score and this week's risk component score.
1842000	1849000	So we did a regression based on this relationship.
1849000	1855000	So if we write this regression out, it's a bit like this.
1856000	1864000	You can think of this P3 as the risk component score for this week.
1864000	1866000	What we want to know is,
1866000	1874000	how much of the previous week's sleep time duration can predict the risk component score for this week.
1874000	1877000	We also added this variable,
1877000	1881000	which is the risk component score for the previous week,
1881000	1884000	to control the autocorrelation.
1884000	1891000	Then we added the dummy variables for each victim.
1891000	1894000	Then we also asked,
1894000	1898000	after completing this regression,
1898000	1906000	how much of the residual can be explained by the previous two weeks' sleep time and the previous two weeks' risk component score.
1906000	1910000	Then we also added the variable for the sleep time,
1910000	1913000	which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,
1913000	1916000	to control the autocorrelation.
1916000	1919000	We also added the variable for the work time,
1919000	1922000	which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,
1922000	1925000	to control the autocorrelation.
1925000	1932000	So we did a total of different regressions.
1932000	1948000	Finally, this graph shows the beta value coefficient for this activity.
1948000	1951000	This is the level of sleep.
1951000	1956000	At each time point, t-1, t-2, t-3, and t-4,
1956000	1970000	we found that sleeping at t-1 significantly predicts the risk.
1970000	1974000	So this is the only significant result we found.
1974000	1977000	These two graphs show the risk of the previous week,
1977000	1980000	and whether it has a significant impact on the risk of the next week.
1980000	1981000	We found that it does.
1981000	1987000	We also found that the predict power of other activities
1987000	1990000	did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.
1990000	1996000	We also found that the predict power of other activities
1996000	2001000	did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.
2001000	2004000	So this is the result we found.
2004000	2007000	To conclude,
2007000	2013000	the domain-general-risk-attitude ontology can be used
2013000	2018000	to capture the relationships between your daily life
2018000	2022000	and the dynamic of psychological properties.
2022000	2028000	The sleep time can predict risk-evaluation changes.
2028000	2032000	The conclusion from the results is,
2032000	2035000	if you had more sleep the previous week,
2035000	2045000	you will be more willing to take risks the next week.
2045000	2052000	So, this conclusion can tell us that
2052000	2061000	a simple physiological thing can affect our risk-preferred changes.
2062000	2066000	So, this is the conclusion we have so far.
2066000	2069000	We have also found that
2069000	2074000	your sleep level can also significantly affect
2074000	2085000	the negative mood of the next week.
2085000	2089000	So, if you had more sleep the previous week,
2089000	2093000	you will be more willing to take risks the next week.
2093000	2101000	So, the sleep time can predict a lot of things.
2101000	2108000	So, this is what we have found so far.
2108000	2116000	So, this is the end of my presentation.
2116000	2125000	Thank you for listening to my presentation.
2125000	2131000	Thank you, Ziyun, for your wonderful presentation.
2131000	2133000	Thank you.
2134000	2138000	Can I ask a question first?
2138000	2140000	Sure, go ahead.
2140000	2147000	So, I want to ask,
2147000	2152000	why is it that the more sleep you have, the more risk-tolerant you become?
2152000	2155000	What I want to ask is,
2155000	2160000	is risk-tolerance related to self-control?
2160000	2163000	Does it need self-control or not?
2163000	2166000	For example, the less sleep a person has,
2166000	2172000	the less self-control they have.
2172000	2176000	I don't know if this is correct.
2176000	2179000	If it's correct, then it's still incorrect.
2179000	2182000	If it's correct, then...
2182000	2184000	Sorry, I'm just...
2184000	2186000	Please continue.
2186000	2188000	No, I mean...
2188000	2194000	It sounds like the less self-control you have, the more...
2194000	2197000	You can't take risks.
2197000	2199000	You want to take more risks.
2199000	2201000	Yeah, because...
2201000	2204000	I think it's related.
2204000	2207000	Yeah, I've seen that too.
2207000	2209000	It's because of the lack of self-control,
2209000	2211000	so they take risks.
2211000	2213000	That's right.
2213000	2216000	For example, drinking too much or something like that.
2216000	2220000	I want to know more about this.
2220000	2224000	I think it's mainly because...
2224000	2229000	First of all, we have measured the so-called self-control trait.
2229000	2236000	We found that the trait has nothing to do with our risk attitude.
2236000	2238000	That's the first thing.
2239000	2241000	I think this relationship...
2241000	2245000	The relationship we're trying to explain is...
2245000	2247000	It's because you might...
2247000	2250000	Actually, I think the logic can be explained on both sides.
2250000	2253000	If we're talking about the logic of this story,
2253000	2256000	it's because you slept better last week,
2256000	2260000	so you might be in a better mood this week.
2260000	2262000	When you're in a better mood,
2262000	2267000	you might have a higher expectation for something risky.
2267000	2269000	You might be more optimistic.
2269000	2271000	So you might want to say,
2271000	2274000	I'm more willing to take this risk.
2274000	2276000	That's true.
2276000	2278000	You just said that...
2278000	2281000	I've seen this study too.
2281000	2284000	If a teenager doesn't sleep well,
2284000	2286000	if he's sleep-deprived,
2286000	2291000	he might not be able to calculate some of his behaviors.
2291000	2294000	You can't do an effective calculation.
2294000	2296000	He might not be able to do it.
2296000	2302000	He might do something risky.
2302000	2308000	I've seen the direction of the study.
2308000	2311000	So when I came to this conclusion,
2311000	2314000	I was actually thinking about how to explain it.
2314000	2317000	The explanation we wrote in the paper
2317000	2320000	is probably to explain it in this way.
2321000	2325000	The so-called repeated major risk
2325000	2330000	is actually more like financial risk.
2330000	2333000	Strictly speaking,
2333000	2338000	it's either no or zero.
2338000	2342000	It's in a positive domain.
2342000	2345000	It's not in the negative risk domain.
2345000	2350000	So the teenager's risk is more likely to be lost.
2350000	2354000	But our risk is more like the risk in the gain domain.
2354000	2357000	So there might be such a difference.
2360000	2362000	So, for example,
2362000	2364000	the research here can't infer that
2364000	2366000	the more you sleep,
2366000	2368000	the more you want to go to the casino.
2368000	2376000	I think maybe...
2376000	2383000	I'm just curious.
2383000	2385000	If you put it that way,
2385000	2387000	I don't think there's a way.
2387000	2390000	I think you put it very well.
2390000	2395000	We're not particularly...
2396000	2399000	If you sleep well,
2399000	2402000	if you face some risky things,
2402000	2405000	you might be more serious about it.
2405000	2407000	You're more serious about evaluating
2407000	2409000	or calculating what the risk is.
2409000	2411000	Because some things are actually...
2411000	2413000	Of course, after the assessment,
2413000	2415000	you're willing to take the risk.
2415000	2417000	That risk may be...
2417000	2419000	Before you have the assessment,
2419000	2422000	you don't have the information,
2422000	2424000	you don't have the concept.
2424000	2426000	Because after you sleep well,
2426000	2429000	you're more mentally prepared to do this.
2429000	2432000	You need more calculative resources.
2432000	2434000	Some calculations.
2434000	2436000	So if you put it that way,
2436000	2438000	you might be facing some
2438000	2440000	risky choices that might benefit you.
2440000	2444000	Then you'll have a better chance to do it.
2444000	2446000	Even if it's taking risks,
2446000	2450000	but it's actually a good decision for you.
2450000	2452000	I think there are actually a lot of
2452000	2454000	different scenarios.
2454000	2456000	It feels like you see this result,
2456000	2460000	and then you have to come up with a story to explain it.
2460000	2462000	So actually,
2462000	2464000	it seems like you have to see different results.
2464000	2466000	It's also quite possible to use...
2466000	2468000	There may be a lot of contradict results.
2468000	2470000	It's true that it happens a lot.
2470000	2473000	I think this result is quite interesting.
2473000	2476000	I can understand what you mean.
2476000	2478000	Because I've seen a lot of papers.
2478000	2480000	They put the risk...
2480000	2482000	Like you said, it's a lost domain.
2482000	2485000	They see risk as a negative thing.
2485000	2487000	But you're using tolerance here.
2487000	2489000	So you can understand that
2489000	2491000	a person would be more willing to
2491000	2493000	take the risk reasonably.
2493000	2497000	About those tasks that require risk but are beneficial.
2499000	2502000	In terms of the nature of our task,
2502000	2506000	you're actually willing to take the risk.
2506000	2508000	The expectation is actually higher.
2510000	2512000	Because if we calculate it,
2512000	2515000	you always take a safe risk.
2515000	2517000	Because you get 5 dollars.
2517000	2520000	But if you calculate the risk-free choice,
2520000	2523000	our design is higher than 5 dollars.
2525000	2527000	Do you have any other questions?
2527000	2529000	If you have any questions, you can ask them directly.
2531000	2534000	I have two questions I want to ask.
2535000	2539000	I think your design is really...
2539000	2543000	You put a lot of factors into it.
2543000	2546000	It's quite rigorous.
2546000	2548000	I have two questions I want to ask.
2548000	2550000	The first one is...
2550000	2555000	Because the age range of your audience is quite large.
2555000	2558000	From 18 to 67 years old.
2558000	2561000	I imagine that at different ages,
2561000	2564000	their life activities would be quite different.
2564000	2566000	For example, some people have retired.
2566000	2568000	Some people are working.
2568000	2570000	Some people are young and still in school.
2570000	2577000	Is there a difference in age or gender?
2577000	2579000	The second question is...
2579000	2583000	When I was collecting the demographic,
2583000	2585000	I was quite curious about
2586000	2592000	whether it was related to social status.
2592000	2596000	I feel that social status also affects
2596000	2600000	the degree of risk you can take.
2600000	2603000	Especially in the financial sector.
2606000	2609000	Do you think there is a difference in life activities at different ages?
2609000	2611000	I haven't analyzed this yet.
2611000	2613000	But I think there should be.
2614000	2620000	But if you just look at the age and gender variables,
2620000	2627000	and compare it with the risk-taking behavior,
2629000	2631000	we can see that people who are older
2631000	2633000	are less likely to take risks.
2633000	2637000	But we don't see a significant difference in gender.
2637000	2642000	We did ask more questions about social status.
2642000	2645000	We asked about their academic background.
2645000	2647000	We also asked about their financial status.
2649000	2651000	We asked a lot of other questions.
2651000	2654000	The variables I mentioned are not what we asked.
2654000	2656000	We have more questions to ask.
2656000	2661000	But I don't have time to analyze other information.
2661000	2663000	So I haven't taken a closer look.
2663000	2665000	But we did ask a lot of questions.
2665000	2669000	We also asked about their drinking habits.
2669000	2671000	We asked about their smoking habits.
2671000	2673000	We still have a lot of questions.
2673000	2676000	But we haven't taken a closer look.
2685000	2686000	Anyone else has a question?
2686000	2688000	If you have a question, please ask.
2690000	2691000	Hello.
2691000	2694000	Can you show us what the app looks like?
2694000	2695000	Oh, sure.
2696000	2698000	I'd like to take a look.
2699000	2702000	I'll stop sharing my screen
2702000	2706000	and show you the screenshot.
2707000	2708000	Okay?
2713000	2714000	Sorry.
2726000	2728000	I remember I don't have it in my IRV.
2741000	2742000	Okay.
2742000	2744000	This is what our app looks like.
2744000	2749000	It's like a map.
2749000	2751000	Can you see it?
2753000	2754000	Yes.
2755000	2758000	This number means how many tasks you have to do.
2758000	2760000	The user can click on it.
2760000	2761000	After clicking on it,
2761000	2764000	like what I mentioned in the report,
2764000	2769000	the rich tasks or surveys.
2769000	2771000	If you don't complete a task,
2771000	2774000	you can get this gem.
2774000	2776000	You can buy this gem
2776000	2780000	to decorate your avatar.
2780000	2781000	This is the avatar.
2781000	2784000	This is one of the ways to design your avatar.
2784000	2791000	It's like completing a journey every week.
2791000	2793000	After you complete it,
2793000	2795000	you can open this gem.
2795000	2797000	But this gem doesn't mean anything.
2797000	2799000	We'll actually give them money.
2799000	2801000	Every time you complete a journey,
2801000	2805000	the map behind it will be different.
2807000	2808000	On the left,
2808000	2810000	because it hasn't completed these tasks,
2810000	2812000	the map behind it hasn't been opened yet.
2812000	2813000	This one is already done,
2813000	2816000	so the map behind it will come out.
2816000	2820000	It has different styles.
2820000	2824000	I think the interface design is quite beautiful.
2824000	2830000	I can share the company of this app to you.
2831000	2844000	We use this design app to do experiments.
2844000	2848000	So it's mainly this data cube app
2848000	2851000	to do our experiments.
2855000	2856000	This is what I just said.
2856000	2858000	You can design your own style.
2858000	2862000	You can make the user more engaged.
2863000	2865000	But the most engaged way is to give them money.
2868000	2871000	We give them weekly payment for the user fee.
2871000	2875000	We'll also give them extra bonuses for the tasks we do.
2875000	2878000	So it's meaningful for them to make those choices.
2878000	2880000	It's not like they're done and that's it.
2880000	2883000	We really give them a corresponding reward
2883000	2886000	based on their choices.
2886000	2889000	So that's about it.
2912000	2913000	If no one has any questions,
2913000	2914000	I can ask one more question.
2914000	2915000	I'm sorry.
2917000	2918000	I don't think this is a question.
2918000	2921000	I don't know if you've read
2921000	2925000	the Noise book published by Daniel Kahneman last year.
2925000	2926000	I just read it.
2926000	2928000	I've heard of it, but I haven't read it.
2928000	2931000	I strongly recommend it.
2931000	2935000	I think this research sounds like
2935000	2939000	a term invented by him called Occasion Noise.
2939000	2941000	The difference in decision-making between people
2941000	2945000	depends on mood and physiological feedback.
2945000	2948000	He mentioned something called
2948000	2950000	Stable Pattern Noise.
2950000	2953000	He said that this is the biggest difference
2953000	2958000	in group decision-making.
2958000	2961000	But there are very few documents being reviewed now.
2961000	2965000	I just saw that you did age and gender.
2965000	2966000	You said there's a difference.
2966000	2968000	I'm curious.
2968000	2970000	When you were reviewing these documents,
2970000	2972000	how did you feel?
2972000	2975000	Why do you think
2975000	2977000	this demographic
2977000	2980000	is difficult to review
2980000	2982000	or study?
2982000	2983000	That's about it.
2984000	2986000	I think the difficulty lies in
2986000	2988000	the fact that this topic
2988000	2990000	has a long history.
2990000	2992000	So there are a lot of documents.
2992000	2995000	And the most difficult thing
2995000	2996000	is what I just said.
2996000	2999000	How do you define the so-called risk preference?
2999000	3001000	Risk preference is a very difficult thing.
3001000	3004000	It's a very abstract construct.
3004000	3007000	It's not like other things.
3007000	3008000	I don't know.
3008000	3009000	But I have to say
3009000	3011000	how do you say
3011000	3013000	this person's risk preference?
3013000	3015000	It's really hard to measure
3015000	3016000	with a single quantitative table.
3016000	3018000	So if you use different quantitative tables
3018000	3019000	to measure,
3019000	3020000	you might get different results.
3020000	3022000	Because what you might ask
3022000	3026000	is different from what other people ask.
3027000	3029000	And the so-called risk
3029000	3031000	has a lot of different domains.
3031000	3033000	There are a lot of different areas of risk.
3033000	3035000	I might be a person
3035000	3037000	who is very willing to
3037000	3038000	ride the cloud car.
3038000	3041000	But I'm actually very afraid of socializing.
3041000	3043000	For example, I may not dare
3043000	3045000	to publish a different opinion
3045000	3046000	in a company.
3046000	3048000	These two are actually risks.
3048000	3050000	But in fact, their areas
3050000	3052000	are very unrelated.
3052000	3053000	So I think
3053000	3055000	this is the most difficult part.
3055000	3057000	It's really hard to have
3057000	3061000	a unified risk preference definition.
3061000	3063000	In addition to what I just said,
3063000	3065000	in fact, this topic
3065000	3067000	has been studied
3067000	3069000	by economists, psychologists,
3069000	3071000	and psychologists.
3071000	3072000	People from different fields
3072000	3074000	have different research methods.
3074000	3076000	The thinking of different research methods
3076000	3077000	is very different.
3077000	3079000	Because this is a very cross-field
3079000	3082000	and very important research topic.
3082000	3084000	But everyone's research method is different.
3084000	3086000	And the face of concern is also different.
3086000	3088000	So it becomes that there are
3088000	3089000	documents everywhere.
3089000	3091000	There are a lot of documents.
3091000	3093000	It's just that it's really difficult
3093000	3095000	to have a single conclusion.
3095000	3097000	And there are a lot of...
3097000	3098000	For example, gender.
3098000	3100000	There are a lot of different conclusions
3100000	3101000	just about gender.
3101000	3102000	Even if there is
3102000	3103000	that kind of meta-analysis,
3103000	3104000	you will find that
3104000	3106000	there are actually a lot of
3106000	3108000	different conclusions.
3108000	3110000	So I think this is
3110000	3112000	a very difficult place.
3112000	3114000	I'm sorry.
3114000	3115000	I just...
3115000	3117000	In that book, it says
3117000	3118000	that there are very few documents.
3118000	3119000	But you just said
3119000	3120000	that there are a lot of documents,
3120000	3122000	but the conclusions are different.
3122000	3123000	Yes.
3123000	3124000	What do you mean by
3124000	3125000	very few documents?
3125000	3127000	Can you say that again?
3127000	3130000	Do you mean gender and age?
3130000	3133000	Gender and age are your research.
3133000	3137000	But Conleman said
3137000	3138000	that it should be considered
3138000	3141000	a difference in domain.
3141000	3143000	Do you mean different risk domains?
3143000	3144000	Yes.
3144000	3146000	I was originally a very risk-taking person.
3146000	3147000	I thought you said...
3147000	3148000	But suddenly...
3148000	3150000	If I were a judge,
3150000	3151000	I was very sensitive.
3151000	3153000	Then I suddenly saw this person.
3153000	3154000	I thought of my son.
3154000	3155000	I was very sensitive.
3155000	3158000	He was talking about this.
3158000	3159000	OK.
3159000	3160000	He said that
3160000	3162000	there is less research in this area.
3162000	3163000	Yes.
3163000	3164000	What do you mean?
3164000	3165000	Sorry.
3165000	3166000	I thought you just said
3166000	3168000	gender or that.
3168000	3169000	Because I think
3169000	3170000	this is more like
3170000	3172000	the difference in personal experience
3172000	3174000	for your risk preferences.
3174000	3175000	Personal experience,
3175000	3176000	or the so-called...
3176000	3178000	We actually want to find
3178000	3182000	environmental factors
3182000	3184000	to see if these environmental factors
3184000	3185000	affect you.
3185000	3186000	But in fact,
3186000	3187000	I think it's hard to study.
3187000	3189000	Because it's hard to measure.
3189000	3191000	It's hard to ask too many
3191000	3192000	personal questions.
3192000	3193000	In addition,
3193000	3195000	like we used to study,
3195000	3196000	there is very little
3196000	3198000	long-term research.
3198000	3199000	So without long-term research,
3199000	3200000	it's hard for you
3200000	3202000	to really capture
3202000	3203000	the events
3203000	3204000	that this person will encounter
3204000	3206000	in his life.
3206000	3207000	Because usually,
3207000	3209000	for the example you just mentioned,
3209000	3210000	it's a bit like
3210000	3212000	this event is very...
3212000	3213000	In fact,
3213000	3214000	it's quite unique.
3214000	3216000	It's very special.
3216000	3218000	It's like meeting your own child
3218000	3220000	and then being sentenced to death.
3220000	3221000	This kind of
3221000	3223000	personal life experience
3223000	3225000	is hard to know.
3225000	3226000	In addition,
3226000	3227000	it's hard to ask
3227000	3229000	such a private thing.
3229000	3231000	RRB also has to be saved for a long time.
3231000	3233000	So I think our researchers
3233000	3236000	try to work towards that direction.
3236000	3237000	It's just that
3237000	3240000	you have to do what you said.
3240000	3243000	It's really...
3243000	3244000	It's an event
3244000	3245000	for you.
3245000	3246000	This kind of
3246000	3247000	risk-benefit difference
3247000	3248000	is really
3248000	3251000	quite difficult to do.
3251000	3252000	But gender and age,
3252000	3253000	these two,
3253000	3254000	because it's a more
3254000	3255000	stable factor.
3255000	3256000	So many people
3256000	3258000	have done this research.
3258000	3260000	Got it.
3260000	3262000	Because it talks about
3262000	3263000	the environment.
3263000	3264000	For example,
3264000	3265000	the weather
3265000	3266000	seems to be
3266000	3269000	less than 10%.
3269000	3271000	And then
3271000	3272000	the personality
3272000	3274000	seems to be
3274000	3275000	higher.
3275000	3277000	It's about 20% to 30%.
3277000	3278000	So...
3278000	3280000	I'm sorry.
3280000	3281000	At the moment,
3281000	3283000	the related personality
3283000	3285000	has a higher
3285000	3286000	risk-benefit ratio.
3286000	3288000	Is the current research
3288000	3291000	relatively easier to do?
3291000	3294000	There are quite a few.
3294000	3298000	But I think...
3298000	3299000	I think it's mainly
3299000	3301000	like what I just said.
3301000	3302000	It depends.
3302000	3303000	If you are a psychologist,
3303000	3305000	you may not be so interested
3305000	3307000	in the personality.
3307000	3308000	So it depends
3308000	3310000	on who is doing the research.
3310000	3311000	Psychologists
3311000	3312000	may be very interested in this.
3312000	3313000	So...
3313000	3316000	There's another thing.
3316000	3317000	If you want to know
3317000	3318000	the risk-benefit ratio,
3318000	3319000	you need to know
3319000	3320000	the impact
3320000	3321000	of this risk-benefit ratio
3321000	3322000	on the next action.
3322000	3325000	What's the next action?
3325000	3326000	Everyone cares about
3326000	3327000	different things.
3327000	3330000	So...
3330000	3332000	To answer your question,
3332000	3334000	there are a lot of researches
3334000	3336000	on the personality
3336000	3338000	and risk-benefit ratio.
3338000	3339000	But what's the point
3339000	3341000	of this research?
3341000	3343000	It depends on
3343000	3346000	what you want to ask.
3348000	3349000	Okay, thank you.
3349000	3351000	So...
3351000	3353000	About the reference documents...
3353000	3354000	I don't think I saw...
3354000	3356000	I think you...
3356000	3357000	I think I posted it
3357000	3358000	on my personal website.
3358000	3361000	Is it not completed yet?
3361000	3362000	Because I want to...
3362000	3364000	You mean this research?
3364000	3367000	Yes, the reference documents.
3367000	3368000	If you want,
3368000	3369000	I can send it to you.
3369000	3371000	I've finished
3371000	3372000	a manuscript.
3372000	3373000	But...
3373000	3374000	This research
3374000	3375000	is...
3375000	3376000	I posted
3376000	3377000	Nature Communication.
3377000	3378000	After reviewing it,
3378000	3379000	it was rejected.
3379000	3381000	So I'm reviewing it now.
3381000	3383000	I hope to post the next one.
3383000	3384000	I want to change it.
3384000	3385000	I want to share
3385000	3386000	my manuscript
3386000	3387000	in public.
3387000	3388000	So I'm still changing it.
3388000	3390000	So I didn't...
3390000	3392000	At least on our lab website,
3392000	3394000	I didn't post it.
3394000	3395000	But if you want,
3395000	3397000	I can send it to you.
3398000	3399000	Okay.
3399000	3400000	Thank you.
3400000	3402000	That's about it.
3408000	3410000	I can put
3410000	3412000	my email
3412000	3414000	in my chat.
3414000	3416000	If you want,
3416000	3418000	I can send it to you.
3427000	3429000	I think there was a question
3429000	3431000	in the chat.
3431000	3433000	How to raise your hand?
3433000	3435000	Was the question answered?
3435000	3437000	I'm sorry.
3437000	3439000	I didn't notice the message.
3439000	3441000	Is that person still there?
3441000	3443000	Found it.
3443000	3445000	Is there anyone else?
3445000	3447000	Okay.
3447000	3449000	Thank you.
3449000	3451000	Thank you.
3451000	3453000	Thank you.
3453000	3455000	Thank you.
3456000	3458000	If no one has a question,
3458000	3460000	I'll ask the last question.
3461000	3463000	No one has a question?
3465000	3467000	Right.
3467000	3469000	Like...
3469000	3471000	In experimental economics,
3471000	3473000	if you want to control
3473000	3474000	the risk,
3474000	3476000	to see the impact of the risk,
3476000	3478000	or to control the risk
3478000	3479000	in the lab,
3479000	3481000	do you usually use
3481000	3483000	hold and load retax to test it?
3483000	3485000	You've seen so many tasks.
3485000	3487000	Do you think there is
3487000	3489000	a better alternative
3489000	3491000	or suggestion?
3492000	3494000	If it's based on
3494000	3496000	the teacher's idea,
3496000	3498000	the task I'm doing now,
3498000	3500000	it's relatively simple.
3500000	3502000	Because it controls one of the options.
3502000	3504000	Always is the same.
3504000	3506000	You just change it.
3506000	3508000	But you just said that
3508000	3510000	the numbers on both sides will change.
3510000	3512000	It makes the task easier.
3512000	3514000	So...
3514000	3516000	Maybe...
3516000	3518000	There won't be problems
3518000	3520000	caused by the task itself.
3520000	3522000	Because I know some researches
3522000	3524000	say that some tasks
3524000	3526000	are too difficult,
3526000	3528000	so they can't be calculated.
3528000	3530000	Our...
3530000	3532000	Our task
3532000	3534000	is designed differently.
3534000	3536000	One option is very simple,
3536000	3538000	and the other...
3538000	3540000	There's only one variable.
3540000	3542000	But...
3542000	3544000	I can't say that
3544000	3546000	it's the best option.
3546000	3548000	So...
3548000	3550000	I think...
3550000	3552000	Experimental economists
3552000	3554000	have been developing
3554000	3556000	new experiments.
3556000	3558000	So...
3558000	3560000	For us,
3560000	3562000	we want to simplify
3562000	3564000	the experiment.
3566000	3568000	Thank you.
3568000	3570000	Any other questions?
3570000	3572000	If not,
3572000	3574000	it's time to
3574000	3576000	say goodbye.
3576000	3578000	Thank you, Ziyun.
3578000	3580000	Thank you, everyone.
3580000	3582000	Let's...
3582000	3584000	Let's...
3584000	3586000	Let's...
3586000	3588000	Let's stop here.
