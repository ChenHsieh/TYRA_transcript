00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to the Taira Talk.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Taira stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
This is an area for young researchers in Taiwan.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
We hold the Taira Talk almost every week.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
The format of the talk is very free and diverse.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
We hope that Taiwan's academic researchers

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
can share their talk or practice online

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
according to their own needs.

00:44.000 --> 01:10.000
The topic of the next two weeks

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
will be more on astronomy.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
On July 2nd,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Liao Ying, a post-doctorate student from Central University,

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
On July 9th,

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
Lian Chuan-Ping, a post-doctorate student from University of Colorado Boulder,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
will share a topic on high-altitude wind turbines.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
This is a topic on aerospace and mechanical engineering.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
Today, we are very happy to invite

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Professor Wang Shu-Ha, a post-doctorate student from Taiwan University.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Professor Wang is interested in

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
privacy, immigration, children and family well-being.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
These topics will be covered in today's talk.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
The topic of today's talk is

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
Social Safety Net Feature in East Asia.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Julia, you can share your screen now.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Let me turn off my sharing.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Sorry.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Can you see me clearly now?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yes.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Can you hear my children crying?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Not yet.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
That's good.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Can I start now?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Let's give a round of applause.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
This is a small tradition of Taira.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Please turn on the microphone

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
and give a round of applause to welcome Julia.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Thank you.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Thank you, Theta, for inviting me to share my research with you.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Thank you, Theta, for your detailed introduction.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Today, I will talk about

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
the social welfare network

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
and its features in East Asia.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
We will cover the situation before and after COVID-19 pandemic.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I know that many of you

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
may not know much about social welfare.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Let me give you a brief introduction.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Social welfare can be divided into three areas,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
including social insurance, social assistance, and welfare services.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Social insurance is a risk factor in our lives.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Many countries use insurance to deal with it.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
However, there are also many countries that do not use insurance.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
In Taiwan, we have a social insurance system

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
for pensioners.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Employment insurance also includes unemployment insurance.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
National Insurance is also a social insurance feature.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
We need to contribute so that we can benefit in the future.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Another part is social assistance.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
In some cases,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
everyone may face risks.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
For example, if you become very poor and unemployed,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
and your job does not allow you to have social insurance,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
or if you encounter some changes in your family,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
you may need social assistance,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
including low-income households and middle-income households.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
In the U.S., we have food stamps,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
which are food-related relief measures.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
In the U.S., Section 8 of the Housing Assistance Act

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
uses housing vouchers to help people.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
There is also public housing in Taiwan.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
In addition, there are also measures to help families

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
who cannot afford to send their children to school.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
In addition to social assistance,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
there are also welfare services.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
For example,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
child abuse or elderly care services

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
may be needed.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Whether it's public or private,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
welfare services are provided by welfare agencies.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
So the social welfare sector is mostly related to Hanguas.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
I will focus on the social assistance sector today.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I will focus on the social assistance sector today.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
In the introduction of the document,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
we often compare the social insurance and social assistance

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
in the East Asian welfare system.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
In the East Asian welfare system,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
we often compare the social insurance and social assistance.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I will explain the terms first.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
The research I am going to share today

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
was initiated in 2019

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
by Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo was invited by the National University of Seoul

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
to give a lecture at their school.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
to give a lecture at their school.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo hopes to have more international cooperation.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I think organizing research teams

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
is a bit like making a movie.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
In my mind,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I want to do the research I am going to report in the future.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
However, it takes a lot of resources

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
to gather all the party members from all over the world.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
to gather all the party members from all over the world.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
After this meeting,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is a professor at Tokyo University in Japan.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is a professor at Tokyo University in Japan.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is interested in Korea.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Dr. Ying-Ho Khoo is interested in Korea.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I invited Dr. Irene from the National University of Singapore

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and Dr. Chen Hong and Dr. Zhao Hsieh

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
from the National University of Singapore.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
We organized a research team to study six places in East Asia,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
We organized a research team to study six places in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
We relate to projects on Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
We relate to projects on Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
We will compare and analyze tests on the six places we study.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
We will compare and analyze tests on the six places we study.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
There are thirty buildings with shrines in the north along theheir names.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
There are twenty buildings with shrines in the north along their names.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
We will compare and analyze tests on the these buildings together.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
We will compare and analyze tests on the these buildings together.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
