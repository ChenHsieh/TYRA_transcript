00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Our speaker today is Yang Yun-Pu, a Ph.D. student from UCLA's Center in Performance Studies.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
Her research interests include East Asian theater research, especially East Asian theater research on Taiwan and China,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
as well as gender and physiological gender research and digital culture research.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
Her paper is The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
She is also a Collegiate University Teaching Fellow

00:39.000 --> 00:51.000
and a Professor of Engaging Gender Performances in East Asian Theater through Digital Storytelling at UCLA's Digital Humanities Program.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
She is also the winner of the Professor's Prize in International Academy of Sciences.

00:56.000 --> 01:07.000
She is also a Ph.D. student in the Department of Theater Studies at Taiwan University of the Arts and a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chinese Studies at Taiwan University of the Arts.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
Today's topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Let's welcome Yang Yun-Pu.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I will now share my first video.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Here it is.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I think everyone can see it now.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
My topic is Gender Performances, The Eructicism of Peking Opera Functions Over the 20th Century.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate, so I am currently writing my paper.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
This topic is one of my papers.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
In today's presentation, I will divide it into two parts.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
In the first part, I will briefly introduce Meng Xiaodong, her performance style, her personal life, and her marriage.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
In the second part, I will focus on how the public views Meng Xiaodong.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
I will also talk about how the New York Times interpreted Meng Xiaodong from the 1920s to the 1950s.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Meng Xiaodong is a very special actress.

02:20.000 --> 02:30.000
In the U.S., sexual harassment, sexual violence, and death are all very sensitive topics.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
So, trigger warning.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
Later, we will talk about topics related to sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual violence, and death.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Everyone should be mentally prepared.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
This is Meng Xiaodong, who I will introduce today.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Meng Xiaodong was born in 1908 and passed away in 1977.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
If I remember correctly, she was born in Shanghai in 1908.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
In 1977, she moved to Taiwan and settled down in Taiwan.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
When she passed away, she was buried in a cemetery in Taipei.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I remember that someone on the Internet shared the location of the grave.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
If you are interested, you can go and take a look.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Meng Xiaodong is a very well-known female veteran in the entertainment industry.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
A veteran is someone who plays a male role on stage.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
There are many types of male roles.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
In short, a veteran is a mature male.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Meng Xiaodong is very famous for being a very good veteran.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
We call female veterans.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
There is a very important concept that I want to emphasize.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
It is easy to say that if a man plays a female role on stage or a woman plays a male role on stage,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
we generally say that this is a backstabbing.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
But in the play, the meaning of backstabbing is not like this at all.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
The meaning of backstabbing is that, for example, Meng Xiaodong has been a veteran since childhood.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
One day, he suddenly played a female role on stage.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
This is called backstabbing.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
If he plays a male role on stage, this is called the job of the job.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
The job is the job of the job in Japan.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
The job is the job of the job in Japan.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So don't mix up the backstabbing concept of the stage with the backstabbing in the play.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Another example is Mei Lanfang.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Mei Lanfang is a very famous veteran actor.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
So when we talk about Mei Lanfang,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
we don't say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
We say that Mei Lanfang uses her job to perform.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
But if Mei Lanfang plays a man on stage today,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
we will say that Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I hope this part can be clarified.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Meng Xiaodong's very famous part,

04:56.000 --> 05:08.000
I think it's still the best backstabbing woman in history.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
You may ask what kind of backstabbing woman is backstabbing woman.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Mei Lanfang is a backstabbing woman.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Backstabbing woman is Yu Shuyan.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Yu Shuyan is the person in the middle.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
She is the founder of backstabbing woman.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
She was born in 1890 to 1943.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Yu Shuyan has a very high status in the old generation.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
To this day, many Beijing opera actors

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
still say that they are learning from the Yu family.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
They think she is a teacher of the Yu family.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
They think she is a legend.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
A legend that cannot be surpassed.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
People like Yu Shuyan are proud all their lives.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
She has only received two students.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
We say that sometimes other young actors

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
may have learned one or two plays from her.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
But they are not formal backstabbing women.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Formal backstabbing women are those who kowtow to her,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
kneel down to her, and give her gifts.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
All famous actors come to witness

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
this kind of formal backstabbing women.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
We say that she is a real disciple.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
She has received two real disciples in her life.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
One male and one female.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
The male is Li Shaochun, the one on the left.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
He is also very famous.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The female is Meng Xiaodong.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Interestingly,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
according to Chinese culture,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
especially in the era of the Republic of China,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
where men and women are very important,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
or in the Qing Dynasty, where men and women were very important,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
it is very interesting that

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
people generally think that Meng Xiaodong

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
is a person who has really been passed down by the Yu family.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because Li Shaochun was too busy.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Li Shaochun had a family to support.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So whoever asked him to act, he did.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Making money is the most important thing.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yu Shuyuan is a very serious person.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
She is very...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I don't think it's natural.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I didn't teach you how to act.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
You act as Sun Wukong every day.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Aren't you embarrassing me?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Meng Xiaodong is different.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Meng Xiaodong,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
we will talk about her marriage later.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Basically, when she studied with Yu Shuyuan,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
she was single.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So she didn't have a family to support.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
She also had more time

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
to study with Yu Shuyuan.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So in the end, people actually think that

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
the person who really

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
got Yu Shuyuan's love

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
and was able to learn from Yu Shuyuan

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
was Meng Xiaodong,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
not Li Shaochun.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We will also talk about Meng Xiaodong's marriage.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The one on the left

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
is when Meng Xiaodong was 19

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
and married Mei Lanfang.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
The one on the right is Mei Lanfang.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
So the existence of this

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
little phoenix

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
became a very interesting topic

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
for gossip magazines at the time.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
They thought that

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
the girl's eyes were female,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and the man's eyes were male.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
The relationship between

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
the two sexes

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
made gossip magazines very popular.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
At that time, Mei Lanfang

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
was already a very famous star.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
A popular entertainment star.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
But later,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
she divorced Mei Lanfang

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
when she was

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
in her late thirties.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
She married another man,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
an old man.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
This old man may not look

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
very good,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
but don't think it's nothing.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Because this old man

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
is actually a very famous

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
young man in Shanghai

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
from the 1920s to the 1950s.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
His name is Du Yuesheng.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
In simple terms,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Du Yuesheng is a very famous

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
and high-ranking gangster.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Meng Xiaodong became his

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
fifth wife.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
This photo

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
is of Meng Xiaodong

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
when he played the role of

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Qing Dingzhu.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Before we talk more

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
about Meng Xiaodong's story,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I also hope to find

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
a small part of his

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
recording and let everyone

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
feel his singing.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But this singing

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
is not a very formal

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
recording.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
In the 1950s and 1960s,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
he lived in Hong Kong for a while.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
When he lived in Hong Kong,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
he recorded at home

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
when he invited

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
his piano teacher.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So there will be a lot of noise.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Please, Pei Xun, play it for us.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Do you have a way to play it?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Yes, I do.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Do you have a way to play it?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes, I do.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Do you have a way to play it?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Yes, I do.

12:10.000 --> 12:39.000
Thank you.

12:39.000 --> 12:49.000
I want to share the screen again.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
Thank you.

12:57.000 --> 13:23.000
This is a simple yearbook.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
This amazing actress,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
when she was 40,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
it was her last time on stage.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
After that,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
no one saw her perform.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
When she was 43,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
she married Du Yuesheng,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
who we just talked about,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
the boss of the underworld.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
A year later,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Du Yuesheng passed away.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Du Yuesheng was seriously ill at the time.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
In the 1960s,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
she moved to Taiwan.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
She lived in Taiwan for a few years

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and then passed away.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
This is a very brief yearbook.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
It's a brief overview of her life.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Before I talk more about

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
her relationship

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
with the gossip magazine,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I want to provide you

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
some background information.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
In the 1970s,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
the competition

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
between genders

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
was very interesting.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
In the 1970s,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
there were only male actors

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
on the stage.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
From 1970 to 1870,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
there were only male actors

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
on the stage.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
On the stage,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
no matter what the role was,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
it was all played by men.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It wasn't until 1870

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
that some female actors

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
joined the industry.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Although some female actors

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
joined the industry,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
in the society at the time,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
there was always a

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
discrimination

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
between actors and prostitutes.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
We can't say

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
it was discrimination.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
In the 1970s,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
1870s,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and especially 1920s,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
we could see

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
that some female actors

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
were already famous.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
They were good at singing and dancing

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and acting,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
so they switched to acting.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
We could also see

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
that some female actors

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
were also taking classes

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
other than acting.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
This was partly true,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
but it was also

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
a problem

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
for some actors.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
In this speech,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I'd like to bring you

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
to think about these questions.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
First,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
let's take a look at

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
how the gossip

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
from 1920s to 1950s

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
influenced

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Meng Xiaodong

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and how their

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
views on Meng Xiaodong

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
changed.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Second,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I'd like to discuss

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
how Meng Xiaodong

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
was full of

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
sexism.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I don't know

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
if you know what sexism is.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
To put it simply,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
sexism is

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
when a person's gender

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
is highlighted.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
For example,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Meng Xiaodong is a girl.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
There are a lot of gossip

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
about Meng Xiaodong's

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
gender.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Later,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
we'll have

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
more practical examples.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So, I'd like to discuss

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
how Meng Xiaodong

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
exercised his autonomy

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
to resist the sexism

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and misogyny of the gossip.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Third,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
let's take a look

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
at how Meng Xiaodong

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
finally found

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
a solution

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
to help himself

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
from the gossip.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Lastly,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I'd like to discuss

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
how Meng Xiaodong

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
is a legendary actress

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and is considered

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
to be the best

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
virgin in Chinese history.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
However,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
there are restrictions

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
on his status.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
His status is not

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
100% perfect.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
What are the restrictions?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
First, let's take a look

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
at a 2020 report.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
In 2020,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Meng Xiaodong was

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
around 10 years old.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I forgot.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
He was 13 years old.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
In the report,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
he wrote that

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
he wouldn't be affected

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
by gossips until he was 16 or 17.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Gossips mean

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
his throat was damaged

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
or his voice changed

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
when he was 16 or 17.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
He said he wouldn't be affected

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
by gossips until he was 16 or 17.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
In the future,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
gossips like

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
En Xiaofeng,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Xiao Lanying,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Chen Huifeng,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
etc.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We can see

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
two things here.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
First, the report

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
was highly anticipated.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Second,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Meng Xiaodong

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
was discussed with

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
other senior female students.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
In the future,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
female students

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
will discuss

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Meng Xiaodong with

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
female students

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and learn from him.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I just wanted to

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
show you

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
what the report looked like

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
at the time.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Most of my papers

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
are based on the report.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I read a lot of old newspapers.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
That's what I read.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
In 1926,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Meng Xiaodong was

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
living in Shanghai.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
In 1926,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
he decided to move to Beijing.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
At that time,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
people thought

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Shanghai made a lot of money

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
but Beijing was a good place

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
for an actor.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
However,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
after he moved to Beijing,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Shanghai newspapers

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
still liked to report his gossips.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
At that time,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
there was no Internet,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
so news could be verified.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Many fake news

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
like

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Meng Xiaodong's suicide

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
were published.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Some

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
vulgar news

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
like this

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
were published.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
When I read this news,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I was shocked.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I thought

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
people in the past

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
were not conservative.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
They could write

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
what they wanted to say.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
At that time,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
there was a civil war.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Many military officials

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
took a fancy to Meng Xiaodong

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and forced him

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
to move to his house.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Of course,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
he didn't just

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
invite Meng Xiaodong to dinner.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
He wanted to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
He said

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Meng Xiaodong

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
was not

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
his type.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
He had sex with Meng Xiaodong

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
every day.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
He felt

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
he was sick of it.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
He even

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
forced his family

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
In the end,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Meng Xiaodong died

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
in this situation.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It was a very exaggerated news.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
At the same time,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
there were

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
similar news.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
There were many

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
similar news.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
For example,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
let's look at

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
the following news.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Meng Xiaodong

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
was robbed

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
by a general.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
They said

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Meng Xiaodong

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
was too small

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
to have sex with Meng Xiaodong.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
After the robbery,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Meng Xiaodong was locked up

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
by a general

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and sent to

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
a hospital.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Meng Xiaodong's name

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
was used

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
to

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
show

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
the sexual behavior

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
between Meng Xiaodong

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
and the general.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
The 87-yuan coin

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
was the

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
size of Meng Xiaodong's

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
sex organ.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The 87-yuan coin

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
was the size of Meng Xiaodong's

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
sex organ.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Meng Xiaodong was

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
robbed by a general

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
and had sex with Meng Xiaodong.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In the end,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Meng Xiaodong was sick

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
and sent to a hospital.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
There were many

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
exaggerated news

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
about Meng Xiaodong.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
As I said,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
these news

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
constantly sexualized

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Meng Xiaodong.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
We call it

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
sexualization.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
It emphasizes

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Meng Xiaodong's gender

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
and sexual

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
behavior.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Of course,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
some commentators

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
couldn't stand it.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
For example,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Aowong

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
wrote many articles

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
about Meng Xiaodong.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
He was a fan of Meng Xiaodong.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
He was so surprised

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
that Meng Xiaodong

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
became a target

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
of gossip.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Meng Xiaodong

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
should imitate an actor

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
and marry a rich man

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
as soon as possible.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Then, no one

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
would gossip about Meng Xiaodong.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
At that time,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
many actresses

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
thought

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
it was impossible

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
to show off on stage.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
So,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Meng Xiaodong should find a time

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
to marry a rich man

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
and live a happy life.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
He shouldn't show off anymore.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
After all,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
it's easy to be sexually harassed.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
At that time,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
people still thought

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
public women

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
were relatively

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
uncivilized.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
For example,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
prostitutes were

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
public women.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
So were actresses.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I'd like to add

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
that

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
the idea of

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
public women

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
still exists

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
in the 60s, 70s,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
and even in the 70s and 80s.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
When I read

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
the records of Taiwanese actors,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I can see that

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
some actresses

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
are attracted by marriage

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
on the stage.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's a common concept.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
However,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
it's not the case today.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
As I said,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Meng Xiaodong was gossiped.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
So,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Meng Xiaodong

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
moved to Beijing

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
and married

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Mei Lanfang at the same time.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
However,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
it was well-hidden.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
No one knew about it,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
except close friends.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
No one knew about it.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Let's talk about

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Mei Lanfang's family.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Before Meng Xiaodong,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Mei Lanfang had two wives.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
The first wife was Wang Minghua.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
The second wife was

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Fu Zhifang.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Fu Zhifang was also an actress.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I heard that Wang Minghua was also an actress.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
However,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Wang Minghua passed away early.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
So, I couldn't find his photo.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Fu Zhifang was also an actress.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Then,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
she became the second wife of Mei Lanfang.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Wang Minghua didn't have children.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Then,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
from

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
1926,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
when Meng Xiaodong moved to Beijing,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and many gossips started to talk about him,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
to 1929,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
basically,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
no one knew

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
about Meng Xiaodong's whereabouts,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
suicide,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
marriage,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
or sexual abuse.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It was a maze.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
You could find different stories in newspapers.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
until now,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
for example,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
this news report

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
was published in

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
1929,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
and was published in

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
February, 1929.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
They said that

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
they published

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
these four photos

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
and discussed

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
where Meng Xiaodong was,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
who he was,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and what he said.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm afraid it's a problem,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
but not a problem.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Some people said that

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Mei Qi,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
which means Mei Lanfang,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
was about to give birth.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Mei Qi's son

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
used a mirror.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Then,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
as you can see,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
these four photos

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
were taken

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
from right to left

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
and ordered,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
asking kiss

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
and being kissed by others.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
They were also giving advice for

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
sister and Sister Ning.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
So,

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
they published

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
gossips photos

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
to discuss where Meng Xiaodong was and

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
finding it very interesting.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
We mentioned that

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
gossip reporters

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
always wanted to find Meng Xiaodong,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
but at the same time,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
how could these photos

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
be posted on Beiyang Newspaper?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Did they

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
deliberately

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
take photos of Meng Xiaodong?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
We don't know.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
At the same time,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
on February 9th,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
a few days later,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
there was another photo.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
This is a photo of Mei Lanfang.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
On the right, it says,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
What are you doing there?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
On the left, it says,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm taking a photo here.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
On the right,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
it says,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
This is a photo about

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Mei Meng.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
On the right,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
it says,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Meng Xiaodong.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
On the left, it says,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Mei Lanfang.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Do you think

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
these two words

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
are written by different people?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
To me,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
these two words

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
are used to discuss

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
the relationship between

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
We say that

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
are getting closer

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
and getting married.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
can they live a happy life?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Maybe not.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Because we just talked about

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Mei Lanfang and two wives,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Wang Minghua,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
and

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Fu Zhifang.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Fu Zhifang is described as

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
a very jealous person.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I didn't live in that era.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't know them.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
So I don't know if Fu Zhifang

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
is really jealous.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But the report said

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Fu Zhifang regards Mei Lanfang

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
as his own

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
exclusive mate.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
He doesn't allow

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
anyone to get close to Mei Lanfang.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Another report said

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
everyone

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
hopes that

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
can get back together.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
At that time, there were a lot of gossips.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Some said they were divorced.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Some said they were together.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
The report said

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
everyone wants Mei Lanfang

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and Meng Xiaodong to be together.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
They are a perfect couple.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
But

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Fu Zhifang doesn't want

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
them to be together.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Because he thinks

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Mei Lanfang is his exclusive mate.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So he doesn't allow anyone

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
to get close to Mei Lanfang.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
So

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
when these two

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
use exclusive mate

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
to describe Mei Lanfang,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
it shows

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
that

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
in the drama,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
in the sexual scenes,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
the female actors' power is obviously weaker

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and they are more likely to be harassed.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
They are more likely to be sexually harassed.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
They are more likely to be involved

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
in the gossips.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
However,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
in Mei Lanfang's home,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
we can see another

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
sexual dynamic balance.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
It's not as traditional

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
as we think.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
It seems that

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
men have more power.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
On the contrary,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Fu Zhifang seems to have more power.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Moreover,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
when they

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
describe Mei Lanfang

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
as their exclusive mate,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
it seems that

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Mei Lanfang is also

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
being sexually harassed

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
by Fu Zhifang

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
as her exclusive mate.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
They describe Mei Lanfang

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
as a piece of meat.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
It's a piece of meat

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
that everyone wants.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
So we can see

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
that Mei Lanfang is also

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
being sexually harassed by Fu Zhifang.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
In this news article,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
some people

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
describe Mei Lanfang

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
as a piece of meat

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
that everyone wants.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
that everyone wants.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Basically,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
to perform in the 1920s.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
In this news article,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Mei Lanfang came to the U.S.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
to perform in the 1920s.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
When she came back to China,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
she was very popular.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
She was very popular.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
She was very popular.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
On the other hand,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
her mother

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
died at the same time.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Mei Lanfang was very sad.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
The worst part of this news article

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
is that

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Mei Lanfang not only

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
felt sad for her mother's death,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
but also wanted to

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
deal with the two beautiful wives.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
deal with the two beautiful wives.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
The two beautiful wives

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
are not Wang Minghua,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
but Fu Zhifang and Meng Xiaodong.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Meng Xiaodong is the one

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
who is fighting for the two women.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Mei Lanfang is very sad.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Mei Lanfang is very sad.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
The gossip media

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
likes to show these things.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
The gossip media likes to show these things.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
The way these articles are reported

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
is very meaningful.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
is very meaningful.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
It's not just about

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's not just about

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
discussing their family affairs.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
discussing their family affairs.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Then,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Then,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
in 1932,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
in 1932,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
officially divorced.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
their relationship is always very good

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
their relationship is always very good

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
me and Wanhua

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Meng Xiaodong said

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
we also have no need to bother many people with separating

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
we also have no need to bother many people with separating

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
he meant that it's good to be separated

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
he was very polite

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
he meant that it's good to be separated

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
it's also mentioned on a report

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
about their divorce

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
so

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
then

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I will show you

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
what I circled

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
what I circled

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Meng Xiaodong's key difference

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
before that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
he said it's good to be separated

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
in 1933

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
so you can see

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
in 1932

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
he said it's good to be separated

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
in 1933 he got angry

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
because

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
the news wrote many awful things

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and it's very serious

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and it's very serious

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
some even said

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Meng Xiaodong was cheating or something

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
in 1933

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
there was a warning

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
and at the same time

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
a lawyer said

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Meng Xiaodong

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Meng Xiaodong

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
hired me to be his lawyer

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
hired me to be his lawyer

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
so if anyone

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
dare to write nonsense

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
we will sue you

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
so Meng Xiaodong

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Meng Xiaodong

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
started to use the newspaper

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
as a counterattack

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
to his independence

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
this is a warning

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
to his independence

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
so

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
let me read it

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
let me read it

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
the warrior, Meng Xiaodong,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
was a child and very good at study

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
he was not very good at reading

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
he was not very good at studying

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
and he never learned

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
and he never learned

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and he never learned

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
and he never learned

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
so

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
this is a warning

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
he can't stand it

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Meng Xiaodong thought it was annoying

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
he wanted to stop telling gossips

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
he wanted to stop telling gossips

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
but the interesting thing is

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
when I was looking for newspapers

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
when I was looking for newspapers

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I didn't find so many gossips

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I didn't find so many gossips

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I think one possibility is

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
that those newspapers are gone

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
they didn't stay until today

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
the second possibility is

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
maybe those gossips

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
are not published in the newspapers

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
they are more like a

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
gossip

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
gossip

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
gossip

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
gossip

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
gossip

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
gossip

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
gossip

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
gossip

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
gossip

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
gossip

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
gossip

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
gossip

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
gossip

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
gossip

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
gossip

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
gossip

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
gossip

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
gossip

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
gossip

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
gossip

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
gossip

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
clip

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
clip

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
clip

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And then after he published

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
that warning

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
he

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Later on, he began to worship

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I'm sorry to worship Yu Shuyan as a teacher

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Then here we will

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
It will be involved in how he

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
turn that is the actress

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
in the drama circle

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
status

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
So when I read the magazine

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I will also see a very interesting phenomenon

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
is that they discuss the actor

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
They call her Mingling

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
The male actor is called the female spirit

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
But why is the male actor not the male spirit

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Or the female actor is not Mingling

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Just this way of classification

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
In fact, it has already shown the society at the time

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
He is the whole

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
is the sexual imagination

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
The male actor is the famous Mingling

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
The actress is a female actor

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Then

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
He

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Mo Xiaodong

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
One of the ways to turn this way

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
It's very

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Very ironic

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
His way

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
His way of sarcasm is

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
How do you turn a girl

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
In the drama circle

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
First of all, you have to have a super famous

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Male teacher

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
You can't go to a female teacher again

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Because the actress has already been looked down upon

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
What's the use of going to a female teacher

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
You must find a famous male teacher

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And this male teacher must be respected by everyone

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
And then on stage

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
How does he show himself

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
You can't play yourself

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
You can't play your own style

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Because no one cares about your style

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
You have to play Yu Shuyuan

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You have to play Yu

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You are not

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
For example, you are playing Zhuge Liang on stage today

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
You are not playing Zhuge Liang

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
You are playing Zhuge Liang

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Only through this way

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
To make others feel

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
You are a good actor

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Because you are better than those other male actors

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
There is a way

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Like Yu Shuyuan

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
So like Yu Shuyuan

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Is a very important point

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
So in this whole

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Within the scope of gender performance

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Meng Xiaodong, he blurs

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
The boundary between the male spirit and the female spirit

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
He

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
He is no longer just a female spirit

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
He is also a male spirit

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Because he is better than male actors

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Can perform Yu's Zhuge Liang

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Zhuge Liang

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Then we said

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Before

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
When he was 13

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
The report said

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
If he grows up to 16 or 17 years old

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
He will definitely be like these women

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's the same

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
But

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
This situation is

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
After he lost to Yu Shuyuan

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
There are very different changes

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
For example, there is a report that says

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
There is a special case

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
He is Meng Xiaodong

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
All female actors

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Anyway, female actors are female actors

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
But there is a special case

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
He is Meng Xiaodong

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Or they will

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Keep talking about Meng Xiaodong's voice

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Then say

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Meng Xiaodong's voice is

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Better than Tan Fuying

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Better than Ma Lianliang

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Better than Yan Jipeng

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Better than Wang Youzhen

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
All these

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Sorry, Wang Youchen

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So all these names

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
All these names

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Are very famous male students

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
So when they put Meng Xiaodong

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
This name and other famous male actors

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
When comparing

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
It means he can already succeed

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Can't say it's a complete success

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But at least he challenged

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
In the industry

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Gender rights

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Then another one

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
This report

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Just show you the title

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Worth a compliment

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Compare with Xiaodong

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
We just talked about

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Yu Shuyuan's life

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Two disciples

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
One is Li Shaochun

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
The other is Meng Xiaodong

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
From this title alone

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
We can see

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Obviously this commentator

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
He thinks Meng Xiaodong is better

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Because if

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
He thinks Meng Xiaodong is worse

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Why take Li Shaochun and Meng Xiaodong

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
To compare

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
He can say

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Li Shaochun's Qi Yuanbao is worth a compliment

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Much better than Meng Xiaodong

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
He doesn't need to compare with Meng Xiaodong

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Of course it's because Meng Xiaodong's performance is better

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
So Li Shaochun is also very good

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
But not as good as Meng Xiaodong

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So I have to compare with Meng Xiaodong

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
So again

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
We have seen

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
When he was in his 20s

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
When people talk about actors

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Talking about female actors is talking about female actors

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Talking about male actors is talking about male actors

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
The age and age of women are not related

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
But now he broke that boundary

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Then

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
In 1943

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
When he studied with Yu Shuyuan for about six years

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Unfortunately, Yu Shuyuan passed away

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Then he wrote in the newspaper

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
A report

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
This is my English translation

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
This is my English translation

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
But the original text is

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Then there is no way to complete the teacher's training and guidance

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Then

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
The second

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Then the fourth line

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
He wants to say

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Fortunately, I still have a lot of male colleagues

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Senior and junior

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
They will continue to perform

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
They will continue to perform

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Then they will

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
They will pass on the style of Yu Shuyuan

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And me

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I have no achievements

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I have no achievements

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
We just talked about

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
We just talked about

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
He is blurred

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
The boundary between male and female actors

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
The boundary between male and female actors

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
But in this report

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
He blurs himself very much

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think this

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I think this article is actually a very interesting thing

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I think this article is actually a very interesting thing

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Meng Xiaodong is a bit

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
He is a bit cynical

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
He is a bit cynical

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
So when he said

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Unfortunately, I am a woman

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I just can't do it very well

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Fortunately, I have a lot of seniors

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
He really feels that way

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
He really feels that way

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I'm not very sure

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm not very sure

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
What is he thinking

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
But this way of writing

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
You can feel

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
He is a woman

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
He is a woman

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
But he wants to learn the fish

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
But he wants to learn the fish

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
He has some resentment

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
He has some resentment

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Not so simple emotions

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
He has some very complicated things in it

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
These very complicated emotions

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Including the one in the drama

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Including the one in the drama

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Gender and then

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And all the time

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Everyone thinks that female actors

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Everyone thinks that female actors

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Because I feel that what conditions are born

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Because I feel that what conditions are born

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Will make them unable to play well

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Will make them unable to play well

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Although Meng Xiaodong is very

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Although Meng Xiaodong is very

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
He said he had no achievements

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
But in fact, in the later newspaper

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
A lot of people describe it

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
A lot of people describe it

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Fish succulent

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Or I would say

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Fish succulent is dead

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
The only way we can hear

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
The only way we can hear

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
The only way we can hear

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's only Meng Xiaodong

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Meng Xiaodong

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Meng Xiaodong

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Meng Xiaodong

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I went out to envy

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
This happened in Shanghai

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
He said no

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
He said I was not angry

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
He said I was not angry

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I don't want to break the tradition

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
My teacher never taught me

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I have to come out to admire

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I have to come out to admire

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
There is a very interesting point

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
There is a very interesting point

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
You must come out to admire

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You must come out to admire

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
You must come out to admire

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Who invented this

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
It's Meilanfang

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
It was started in Shanghai

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
It was started in Shanghai

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
When Meng Xiaodong said

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
When Meng Xiaodong said

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It was a new trend

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
It was a new trend

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But at the same time

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
It may be to a certain extent

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Back then

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Back then

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Back then

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Upset

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
I thought it was a matter of course

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I thought it was a matter of course

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
The last point

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Let's talk about

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
The style of the fish

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
The style of the fish

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
What kind of restrictions did Meng Xiaodong bring

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Let him get a lot

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Let him get a lot

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And a lot of viewers love him

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And a lot of viewers love him

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Both Meng Xiaodong and Meilanfang

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Will perform at the birthday party

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Will perform at the birthday party

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
So the gossip reporters started to move

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
So the gossip reporters started to move

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I want to see them perform together

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I want to see them perform together

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
So

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
The point here is

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
He became a very good performer

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
He became a very good performer

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
The performance was worth it

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I even feel that after Yu Shuyan died

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I can only rely on Meng Xiaodong

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
But you can't control these things

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
But you can't control these things

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Don't talk about his gossip

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
These things

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
These things

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Don't let everyone talk about his gossip

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
There are some more detailed stories

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
There are some more detailed stories

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I won't say anymore

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I won't say anymore

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
As we say, he's in his 20s

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Some unconsciously

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Some unconsciously

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
2017

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Although he's not like before

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Although he's not like before

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
However, these things

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Are not able to completely avoid

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Moreover, this will also hurt

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
It feels that

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
His realization is to learn from others

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
His realization is to learn from others

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
He's not able to create his own ranks

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
But I think this is a

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
In this era, sometimes there will be some

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Unnecessary restrictions

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
You can't ask a person

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
To completely

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
To completely

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
To completely

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
To completely

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
To completely

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
To completely

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
To completely

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
To completely

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
To completely

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
To completely

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
To completely

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Time is almost up

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I quickly tell you

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I hope that everyone remembers

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I hope that everyone remembers

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
What we discussed

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
From 1920 to 1950

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
The public

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
The public and gossip

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
About what happened to Meng Xiaodong

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
We just said

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
From the beginning

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
He was considered as a woman

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And was constantly misinterpreted

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
After he lost to Yu Shuyan

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Everyone saw

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
His achievements in the art of fish

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And see him in the art of fish

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And we have to recognize one thing

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It's because he lost to Yu Shuyan

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
It's because he learned fish well

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
So everyone recognizes his achievements

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
If he lost today

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Any excellent female teacher

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Maybe everyone won't think so

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Then

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So all the way we can see

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Everyone gossip

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
From misinterpretation

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
To respect

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
To see him as a good artist

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
To see him as a good artist

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
But at the same time

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
But at the same time

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
It's not like

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
We will discuss the art of fish

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
We will discuss the art of fish

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It's not like that

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
There are some restrictions

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
There are some restrictions

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Then

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
How did Meng Xiaodong

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Resist those

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Misinterpreted reports

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Misinterpreted reports

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Mainly

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Mainly I answer this question

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I'm using

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Meng Xiaodong's report on the police

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Meng Xiaodong's report on the police

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's gossip news

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
He also uses newspapers to respond

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
These reports

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That is to say the newspaper as a public space

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
That is to say the newspaper as a public space

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Then you can use it

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
To attack you

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
The third point is

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
How did Meng Xiaodong

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Find a way

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
To get him

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
To get him

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
To get him

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
To get him

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
In this way

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
I personally think

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Because he worshiped Yu Shuyan

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
He worshipped Yu Shuyan and studied very hard

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Let the public think

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
He is the male version of Yu Shuyan

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
He is the only one who can be considered

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
He is the only one who can be considered

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
He is the only one who can be considered

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
He uses a male teacher

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
He uses a male teacher

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
To be the shield

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Of course he did well

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
To draw these gossips

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
The last point we said

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
He performed

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Actually, it's all about performing his teacher

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
What are the restrictions on the teacher?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
On the one hand, of course

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Perform your teacher

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Don't let those gossips

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Completely away from you

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
As long as there is an opportunity

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
The gossip media will still be

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
The reporter will still be active

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
The second is that you perform your teacher

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
But what you perform is always his style

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
You can't create your own style

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Yes, and finally

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I want to show you

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
A trailer

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Then ask Pei Xuan to prepare

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Help me broadcast this trailer

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
This trailer is a movie

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Mei Lanfang

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
2008 movie

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Mei Lanfang is played by Li Ming

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Meng Xiaodong is played by Zhang Ziyi

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
To be honest, it's not a particularly good movie

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Because the family had a lot of

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Because the family had a lot of

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Rebellion and unhappiness

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
How can you write my ancestor like this

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
So some parts of this movie

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
It's pretty beautiful

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Especially inside

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
There is a

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Mei Lanfang's

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Friend is Qi Rushan

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
He later came to Taiwan and became

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Taiwan is very famous

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Famous people in the cultural world

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's also very serious

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because I think it's with the Kuomintang

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Anyway

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Anyway, it's fun

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
If you are interested in knowing more

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
You can also watch this kind of movie

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Then if you are interested

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
If you know more, you can

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Google different things on the Internet

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Please help me broadcast this documentary

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Thank you all

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It's not a documentary, it's a movie

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Miss Meng

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Mei Daye

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
See you on stage

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Who destroyed her lonely dream

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
You dare

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
It's for Mei Lanfang

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Know

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
What do you have

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Just say it

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
It turned out to be this sentence

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Meng Xiaodong will never meet Mei Lanfang again

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Say it again

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Meng Xiaodong

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Let go

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You dare to lie to me

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Because you can't leave Mei Lanfang

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Who is your sister

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Tang Xiaohong

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
You dare

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Thank you

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Thank you

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
My speech ends here

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Thank you all

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Thank you Yunpu

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Thank you for his wonderful speech

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Now it's time for Q&A

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Does anyone have any questions?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Does anyone have any questions?

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
If not

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I'll ask the first question

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I'll ask the first question

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I want to ask

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
In that era, including the small newspaper

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Who is the main target?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Who is the main target?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Who is the main target?

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Who reads newspapers today?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Who reads newspapers today?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Because most people

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Because most people

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
They read the newspaper

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
They read the newspaper

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Can't completely say

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Can't completely say

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Not a real literate

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Not a real literate

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Not a real literate

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
He read the dictionary

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
He read the dictionary

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
He doesn't want to be a poet

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
What green-daisy history poems

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
What green-daisy history poems

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
What green-daisy history poems

57:15.000 --> 57:15.000


57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I remember, just

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I used to read Poetry Dream

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
It was for example that their

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It was for example that their

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
It was for example that their

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
poetry

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
this is the people more or less

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I think

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
first of all, the Red Dragon dream was passed down

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
primero, la playa comprehensivamente

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
gradually collapsed, there is a relationship

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
so

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I don't know what to say about them

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I believe it is

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
There must be some people like the Red Dragon dream

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Anyway, the family is

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
After the family comes to the middle

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Then come to see those gossip

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
right

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
But to say

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
In the end

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
In the end

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Who is the one who sees it completely?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I think

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I think the people who see it

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
It's very wide

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
It's from

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Very wide, but not to everyone

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Because after all, many people are literate

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
But the problem is that you are really

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
The kind of high class is really

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
The kind of literate

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
More aristocratic

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Then they are quite ignorant

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I want to ask a question

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
That is to say

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
So Meng Xiaodong is in that era

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Is the first person to worship Nanlaoshi as a teacher?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Is there anyone else doing this in the future?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I think I see it now

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I see it now, I think he is

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
The first person to worship Nanlaoshi so formally

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
It wasn't before

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
But everyone might just learn a play

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Or say a few words

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
So that probably doesn't count

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Is the real worship

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Then is there anyone after him?

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Because there are still a lot of female teachers today

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Can't say a lot, there are still female teachers in the drama world today

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Yes

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Thank you

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
May I ask

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
If you have any questions

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
You can ask now

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Or if you want to post it in the chat room

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I can also help you

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Ok

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
There is a question in the chat room

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Is it qualitative research?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Or can it be quantified?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I think I should be considered qualitative research

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
After all, it is file research

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Then analyze

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Some articles

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Can it be quantified?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
This is a good question

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Because I did a digital paper before

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Then I have put a part of

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
The file I collected

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Is it quantified?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
But I think

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
That quantification is still very shallow

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
It's more like

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
All about these gossips

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
For example, in different cities

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Then there are a few

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Then there are a few different newspapers

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Some cities are also more popular

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
But this algorithm

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
There are still some problems

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Because you say where the newspapers are the most

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Of course, Beijing and Shanghai are the most

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
But can this explain

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Can it be said that it is not popular in Wuxi?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Because it is also very popular in Wuxi

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But the newspapers in Wuxi are not as many as those in Beijing and Shanghai

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
It can be quantified

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But there are many traps to be careful

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
In addition to gossip newspaper

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Are there any other sources?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
About this

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I use gossip newspaper

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
But some of my other articles

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
For example

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Female actors wrote their own memoirs

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Something like this

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Then some will

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
There is one thing I think I can

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Just clarify

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Why is most of it gossip newspaper?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Because the newspaper did not want to write them

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Just these people

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Just these people

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
They want to discuss more serious things

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
He didn't want to write these gossips

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So this is why I found

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Most of them are gossip newspaper

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Or what kind of newspaper

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Source

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Then I have a question

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It may be related to this

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
So at that time, the newspaper

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Will not discuss at all

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
These

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Artistic things

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Or they will discuss other forms of art

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
But they feel that the newspaper is not enough

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Or why?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
For them

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
This is not art at all

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
For them, this is like today

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
For example

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Will Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen say it is art?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It doesn't seem to be

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It's just a popular entertainment

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I seem to be a little disrespectful to Jay Chou and Tsai Ing-wen

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Sorry

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Anyway, in that era

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
The newspaper is a popular entertainment

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You don't think it's art

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Popular entertainment is like

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Like today's stars

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Who is in a relationship with who

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Who got married and divorced

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Just this feeling

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So do you think Jay Chou will discuss these things?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Maybe a lot

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Especially

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I didn't talk about it in this speech

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Probably

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Around 1930

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
There was a shooting case

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's also related to Meng Xiaodong

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Anyway

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
The gossip is widely spread

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
What do you say about Meng Xiaodong's admirer

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Then I'm not happy that Meng Xiaodong is married to Mei Lanfang

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And then I'm going to shoot Mei Lanfang

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It's about shooting

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Of course, the newspaper will report it

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
For gossip

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But in general

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
They may publish a lot

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's a drama advertisement

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
You can see

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
What kind of play was played today

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But they won't

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Write some exaggerated gossip

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So I mean

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
So these newspapers won't write about

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Artistic comments on the drama

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Or do they actually have any

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Artistic comments are not included in the newspaper

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
According to the newspaper of that era

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
They will write artistic comments

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But they almost only comment on male actors

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And it's very serious

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That kind of comment

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
For example

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
For example, he said

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Someone played Si Lang Tan Mu

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Then he based on that Si Lang Tan Mu

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
How to sing each sentence

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And then make a super detailed comment

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
So even in Meng Xiaodong

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
It's like

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It's considered

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The first person in the old god

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Even after the first person

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
These shocking newspapers

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I still don't want to comment on his drama

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I remember that

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I have seen some

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Not so many

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
More actually appeared in a newspaper

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Called Beiyang Newspaper

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That Beiyang Newspaper is basically

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Meng Xiaodong's fans

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I can't say that the whole Beiyang Newspaper is reporting Meng Xiaodong

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But the editor-in-chief of Beiyang Newspaper

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Sha Dafeng and several comments in it

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
They are all Meng Xiaodong's fans

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So they reported a lot about him

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Whether it's gossip

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But because they are fans

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So their gossip won't be that bad

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
They will

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
There will also be some positive news

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
About his performance

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But first of all, the fans' eyes

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Are all with rose filters

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So they may also write more

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
You know

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It will be more beautiful

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Thank you

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Does anyone else have other questions?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Or do you think

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I don't speak clearly

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Want me to clarify again

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
How to determine

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Gossip newspaper

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Is it exaggerated

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
How to determine

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
The topic you discussed today

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The impact on the aftermath

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Okay, first of all, I think

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
We can't be sure if the gossip newspaper is exaggerated

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Because after all

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
We are not from that era

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And even if we are from that era

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Everyone will have a different opinion on one thing

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I think the only thing I can do

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Is to compare different gossip newspapers

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
To discuss

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
What they present

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
What is it

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So I'm not going to comment

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
What the gossip newspaper writes is true or false

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
That's not important

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
What I want to discuss is how the gossip newspaper discusses Meng Xiaodong

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And the topic I discussed today

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
The impact on the aftermath

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Should refer to contribution

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I think

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
What I care about the most

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Is the right to speak in history

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And the competition between genders

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So what I'm going to discuss

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So what I'm going to discuss today

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
To be honest

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I don't care about Meng Xiaodong's story

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Whether it's true or false

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Whether those comments are true or false

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
The point is that I want to know

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
In that society

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Through a story like Meng Xiaodong

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Their contribution between genders

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And the whole country

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
From the country to the Beijing Opera

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
To the family

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
How is their gender

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Interaction between power and language

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
This is what I want to know the most

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And then I want to know through this story

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
To understand that period of time

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
How the language of the whole society

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
How does the right to speak work

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I hope this answers your question

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Then I have another question

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
If the audience still has you

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
That is to say

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
In the process of speaking

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That is to say

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That's the second wife in the south

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
When she reported to her husband

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That is to say

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Then you mentioned

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
It seems that this power relationship

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's a bit convoluted

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I think it seems

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'm not sure

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
My doubt is

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Many times

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
You only call one person

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
It should be said that many times

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Kindness seems to be a

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Special attack on women

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It doesn't sound like

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
A power relationship computer

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
But a

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
A special way to target women

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Because

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Continue

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I just want to say

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I want to say

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I hardly hear anyone say

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
A man is kind

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
But you often hear people like to comment on women

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So this is a

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I'm repeating

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's a way to target women

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Instead of a power relationship computer

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I think you're really good at this

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I think it's here again

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Showed

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I think it's about gender

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The dynamic and power relationship

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I think he seems to be

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It's hard to say

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's fixed every time

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That is to say

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
There may be a general trend

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
But if you look closely

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It can be divided into a lot of things

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And I totally agree

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
The kindness of women

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Kindness is a plan

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
But at the same time

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
They can target this matter

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Is to make a big article

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
For example, they never talk about Wang Minghua

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Kindness, they only talk about Fu Zhifang

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I think this matter actually reflects

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Fu Zhifang at home

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
He does have power

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Because you go to see other

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Other is the actor

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The relationship between them is that private life

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You hardly see anything like Fu Zhifang

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Almost all

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
What do you want to do

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
If you want to have an affair with someone, have an affair

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Then their wife is in the position of the victim

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I will add another example

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
He is not in the Republic of China

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
He is in

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Dorothy Cole

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I suddenly forgot

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Anyway, it was during the Ming and Qing dynasties

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Everyone usually thinks

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
The status of women

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
It feels like it's all over

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Suppressed by men

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But there are also scholars

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
They will do some research

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
If you look closely

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The relationship in the family

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
You will find that the male owners

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Men are fighting outside

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
As an official

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Then stay away from home

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But actually at home

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Daughter and son

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Support the whole family

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So their status

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
May not be as low as everyone imagines

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
He used this method to discuss

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Sexual power sometimes

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Not so absolute

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It's like a man

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Thank you

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Is there any audience

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Any questions

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
If not

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I will turn off the recording first
