00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today we are very honored to invite Dr. Liao Ying to talk about his research.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Today's topic is Mission ACE.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Before we start, let me briefly introduce Dr. Liao Ying.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Dr. Liao Ying graduated from the University of Bern, Switzerland.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Dr. Liao Ying specializes in space and astrophysics.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
He is currently a professor at Tsinghua University,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
teaching space exploration theory and practice.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Our tradition is to mute everyone,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
so that the speech will be more smooth.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
But before we start, please unmute yourself,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
so that the speaker can hear our applause.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's welcome today's speaker with a round of applause.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Thank you.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
I will probably speak a little faster.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
My master's degree is in astrophysics.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
After that, I went to Switzerland to study.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
We are still in the physics institute.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Our school has three branches.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
One of the branches is called Space Science and Planetary Research.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
In Chinese, it stands for 太空與新興科學.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
The entire branch focuses on things like NASA and JPL.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I did a two-year postdoc at the University of Macau.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Then I came back to Taiwan for COVID-19.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
I have been teaching at Tsinghua University since last year.

02:00.000 --> 02:11.000
I teach space exploration theory and practice.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I teach in English.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Tsinghua University does not teach space science,

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
so I thought this would be a good place to start.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
I am interested in solar systems,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
such as comets, asteroids,

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
and space mission design.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
In 2019, I took part in a competition called

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
CubeSat Mission Design Contest.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
I am interested in space mission design.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
I saw the competition in early 2019,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
so I decided to take part in it.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
I found two of my teammates.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
We designed a mission together.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
We were lucky to win first place.

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
Since then, I have been doing research on space mission design.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I can't say it is a rigorous research.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
The topic I am going to talk about today is still a proposal.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
My name is Ace.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
It is a very preliminary proposal.

03:50.000 --> 03:58.000
If you know a little bit about space mission design,

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
space mission design is very complicated.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
It requires a lot of manpower and time to do different things.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I will explain it later.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
This is a proposal from our team.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
This is for another international space mission design competition,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Mission Idea Contest.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
This is a proposal for this competition.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
We advanced to the finals, but we did not win.

04:39.000 --> 04:49.000
I would like to briefly explain Mission Idea Contest.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
It is an international space mission design competition.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
It is organized by a non-profit organization called Unisec.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It is a non-profit organization.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
It is organized by universities around the world.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
It is organized by universities around the world.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It is organized by universities around the world.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Each country has a local chapter.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Taiwan has a local chapter.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Professor Zhuang is in charge of it.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
This competition is held once a year.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
This competition is held once a year.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
There are three stages in this competition.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
The first stage is to vote.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
After the judges have finished voting,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
they will enter the next stage.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
The last stage is to submit a verbal report.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
After submitting the verbal report,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
the judges will choose two candidates.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
This competition is quite tough.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
The judges are mostly professors.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
The judges are mostly professors.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
We had a host of the competition that year.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
We had a host of the competition that year.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Their judges are very strict.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I recommend this competition.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
The judges are different every year.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
2020 and 2021 are being held.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
2020 is scheduled to be postponed for a year.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
The definition of deep space is

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
the space beyond the moon.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
However, they also included the mission of the moon in the Deep Space.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
So, you can design a space ship to go to the moon.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
This year and next year,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
we will return to the Earth orbit mission design.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
This is a 6U cube satellite design.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
However, it requires a constellation.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
You can send a lot of stars at once.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
They will have different positions.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
It's a bit like GPS satellites.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
This is a link.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
If you are interested in space mission design,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
you can go to their website.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Their website is complete.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Last year, they had a talk.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Deep Space Mission Design is a difficult topic.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
They had a talk with professors from the University of Tokyo.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
They recorded the talk and posted it on their website.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
They also posted some PDFs.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
You can check them out.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
I would like to talk about the background of space mission design.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
First, you need to know about the spacecraft.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Spacecraft is the soul of space mission design.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm sorry.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
I'm not used to speaking in Chinese.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I usually speak in English.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So, I might speak slowly or pause.

09:18.000 --> 09:28.000
This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
This is a picture of the spacecraft.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
This is the attitude control.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
This is the power.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
This is the internal computer.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
This is the command.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
This is the communication.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
This is the structure of the body.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
This is the orbit.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
This is the orbit.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
You can connect the spacecraft to humans.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
For example, the computer is like our brain.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Our brain receives, processes, and releases various commands.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
We have a body.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Our body is the head and limbs.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Our body is the head and limbs.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Power is like food.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Power is like food.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Power is like food.

11:06.020 --> 11:11.000
Everyone uses a rough metaphor.

11:11.000 --> 11:20.000
It's called understanding space.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Use freedom as a metaphor.

11:23.000 --> 11:31.000
There are six main functions.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
There are six main functions.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
There are six main functions.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
The first one is the body part.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
The first one is the body part.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
In English, we call it the body.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
This is a spaceship or a satellite.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
This is a spaceship or a satellite.

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
In English, we call it a frame.

12:07.000 --> 12:16.000
In English, we call it a cube.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
In English, we call it a cube.

12:23.000 --> 12:33.000
In English, we call it a cube.

12:33.000 --> 12:43.000
In English, we call it a cube.

12:43.000 --> 12:53.000
In English, we call it a cube.

12:53.000 --> 13:03.000
In English, we call it a cube.

13:03.000 --> 13:13.000
In English, we call it cmdh.

13:13.000 --> 13:23.000
In English, we call it cmdh.

13:23.000 --> 13:33.000
In English, we call it cmdh.

13:33.000 --> 13:43.000
In English, we call it cmdh.

13:43.000 --> 13:53.000
In English, we call it at2.

13:53.000 --> 14:03.000
In English, we call it at2.
