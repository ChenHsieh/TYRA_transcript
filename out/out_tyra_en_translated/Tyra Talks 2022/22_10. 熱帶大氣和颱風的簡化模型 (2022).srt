00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech on April 16, 2022.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The speaker we invited today is Jian Muhua.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Atmospheric Engineering.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
After graduation, he explored his own interests in Taiwan for a few years, such as running a super marathon.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In 2016, he went to the University of New York to study mathematics.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In 2018, he continued to study at the University of New York's Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
His speech today is on the simplification model of hot air and typhoons.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are looking forward to his speech.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
According to TAIRA's tradition, please turn on your microphones.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's applaud and welcome Jian Muhua.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now I will give the floor to Jian Muhua.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you, Shi-An.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I am very happy to be able to come to TAIRA to share my own research.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is my current research topic.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because there are some relatively professional parts in the content.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I just saw that many participants are actually people in our field.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I still maintain the original way of speaking.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you are interested, we can discuss it later in the message.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I am Jian Muhua.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am Jian Muhua.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I am a program student at the Department of Atmospheric Science and Technology at the University of New York.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This program mainly deals with atmospheric or ocean topics related to application mathematics.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will start.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let me introduce myself.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I am a son of a person.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My mother is also listening.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I recently became a father.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I am a child.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I recently took care of my son in Taiwan.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I also ran a super marathon.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am also a PhD student at NYU.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I am also engaged in relevant initiatives on Taiwan issues.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I studied at a university in Taiwan.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I also studied at NYU.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I also took part in activities in Taiwan community.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I also took part in our school community meetings.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The following are the activities I have held.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have been to many of these events.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will start today's topic.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Today's topic is the atmosphere in the heat wave.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What can we see in the heat wave?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know what to see.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I found a photo from NASA first.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It is a photo taken from space to the earth.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We can see a lot of clouds.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is the first thing to see.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The second thing is that we can see a hot air balloon in the photo.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or everyone thinks this is a typhoon.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think as an atmospheric researcher,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It is inevitable that we must bring this issue to our living environment.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is related to climate change.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My question is related to climate change.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How will the heat wave change when the climate changes?

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or what kind of impact will the change have on us?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Because my topic is not about the impact.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I will talk about what kind of impact it will have.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The emergence of extreme weather events is directly affected by climate change.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, if the climate changes, the background environment will change.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When the environment changes, the typhoon may become stronger.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In the past few years, we have felt drought or extreme rainfall in Taiwan.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Extreme weather events may increase.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is my own view.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I think we have studied this topic for a long time.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For example, we have studied this topic for a long time.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But in fact, there are still some uncertainties in understanding this issue.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There are still many uncertainties in forecasting or understanding this matter.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We can give an approximate situation.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Most of these uncertain factors come from the clouds we see in this photo.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That is, the impact of water vapor in the physical system.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So my topic today is actually about water vapor.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you are in our field, you will know that this is probably the part of atmospheric thermodynamics.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Today is a simple introduction.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Before the next video, I think what I want to say is a bit like this.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We want to know the impact of extreme events on us.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We have to understand our original state first.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Or what is the physical structure behind it?

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or what is the mathematical structure?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We can say how many degrees we have changed today.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How will the climate change?

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you don't have a background knowledge, you know what its original state is.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or what is the physics behind it?

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can't know what it will become after it changes.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So today's speech will focus on its background state.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Before we start, we know what the background state is.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is stability? What is instability?

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Stability is what we can observe.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We can know what it is without artificial influence.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or what it is like in the original physical structure.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I found a simple concept on the Internet.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What is stability? What is instability?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
First, we can imagine it as a bowl.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There is a ball in the bowl.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When you put the ball in, the ball will roll to the lowest point of the bowl.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How do you move? You push the ball a little bit.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Or you give it a certain range of force.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It won't leave the bottom of the bowl too far.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then we will call this state stability.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you put the bowl in the opposite direction,

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Or you put the ball on a slope,

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The ball will roll to a far place.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then this situation is not stable.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The third situation is neutral.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is a neutral state.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The ball can roll anywhere.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It may be relatively stable in any place.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think what I want to say is that our climate is more inclined to this state.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We have a stable state.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But in the case of climate change, we may become another situation.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It will have a new stability.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Another stability can be more stable.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But this is from point A to point B.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There may be more extreme events.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Or fewer extreme events.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Or a certain extreme event, such as more droughts.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Or there will be more rainfall.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We still need to do more research.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But before all this, we can still understand the stability of state A.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What is the material behind it?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So today's story will probably focus on what our atmosphere is.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, let's start the topic now.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The first point after entering the topic is what we want to talk about.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The first point is buoyancy.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When I was in middle school, buoyancy was a difficult topic.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
At that time, the teacher gave a big concept.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That is, buoyancy equals gravity.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is gravity?

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If we see a object floating on an object,

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The object floating on the object can hold its weight.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So this buoyancy can hold its weight.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Of course, it can also be said that we can dig out the original fluid.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then it can replace its weight.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then it can extend to the second and third layers.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If I have an object sinking in the middle today.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or it happens to float in this fluid.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then we know that the density of this thing or the weight of this thing is equal to the weight of the buoyancy.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That is to say, the density of these two things is basically the same.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The next situation is that the density of this thing is relatively large.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then it will sink to the bottom.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So buoyancy can't support the original weight.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That buoyancy is equal to the weight of the fluid in this space.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What about the concept of buoyancy?

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How do we apply it to the atmosphere?

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is a participant in this experiment.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Come and listen to this speech.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How do we know that the density distribution is in the vertical atmosphere?

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because if we know the density distribution, we know that the object will sink down or float up.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
In a direct way, we measure its temperature and air pressure.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We can know that the density of the ideal gas equation.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course, we can't measure it at every height.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The simplest way is to close a balloon and let the balloon fly up.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
In the process of flying, it will record the temperature and air pressure at each height.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then we can know the density of each layer of air.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then we know the density of each layer of air.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We can know the desitny of each layer of air.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Before we do this, we can do another thing.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Before we do this, we can do another thing.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We know that the surface temperature is higher when flying.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It is reduced with height.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
However, the pressure is reduced with height.

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The pressure is reduced with height.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
On the left chart,

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
On the left chart,

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When standing on the floor, it may be a little 30-40 degrees.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
More than 1,000 times roaring.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
More than 1,000 times roaring.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It may be negative 10 to 40 degrees.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It may be 100 times roaring.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We know that most of the time the atmospheric is stable.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is the anti-intuition thing.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is the anti-intuition thing.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The temperature is getting lower.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The temperature is getting lower.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
However, the density is getting smaller.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The deeper the water water boils,

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The deeper the water boils,

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The deeper the water boils,

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The deeper the water boils,

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The larger the temperature,

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The larger the temperature of the lower ?

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The lower the temperature of the lower channel.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The lower the temperature of the earth's heat,

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The lower the river is.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is an interesting thing.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is an interesting thing.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The altitude of the heat that is atmospheric

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How do we know that

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How do we know that

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The stable atmosphere we just thought about

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How do we discuss

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How do we discuss

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We won't be putting balloons in the next page.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To measure this atmosphere,

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
To measure this atmosphere,

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Just use the imagined way

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Just use the imagined way

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Just use the imagined way

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I�e balloons

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For example, the height here

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
For example, the height here

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I put a balloon

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I move it somewhere else

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And see when

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I move it somewhere else

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When, at a specified height

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Will the balloon move up

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Or down

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And say

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And say

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is the atmosphere stable

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is the atmosphere stable

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is the atmosphere stable

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Will that be strange

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We often have birthday parties

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or sometimes when there's a party

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Or sometimes when there's a party

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Balloon

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's usually inside

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The balloon

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's usually floating in the air

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We can put that

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Relax

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The balloon will float up

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040
That

237
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
The process of floating up the balloon

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The higher the effect

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If we are outdoors

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The garlic will explode

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Will it break

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She just

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Have you wondered why

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The reason is because

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The pressure on the environment changes

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
After you put the balloon on

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That means your balloon

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The original air will get more and more

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Expansion

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
After the expansion

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The outer layer of yours

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No way

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Support you

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When the pressure

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The balloon will explode

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That means

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What I just said

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If we move the A balloon to the B balloon

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's not actually

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A to B

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's like this

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
In the process

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It will slowly expand

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is the principle of expansion

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oops

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The principle of expansion

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's actually the first law of thermodynamics

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That is

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The first law of thermodynamics

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In another idea

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Our heating will be equal to the change in temperature

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Plus

276
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh, plus

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Uh, heating is equal to temperature change

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you are a gas

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because it will expand

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So you have to add

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The effect of expansion

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Uh

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That

285
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The balloon we just talked about

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That balloon

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's actually not heated

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So in this process

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's actually

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The temperature reduction in the process of ascension will be equal to

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Uh, the change in pressure

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Look at this picture on the right

294
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We assume that there is a 25

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The balloon of degree C

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That balloon

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because it is

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because it is a balloon

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So it won't have a quality exchange with the outside world

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You won't have

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Uh, the air outside runs in

302
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You won't have

303
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The air inside runs out

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then it won't have heat exchange

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I won't pass the heat out

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Go outside

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And the heat outside

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Won't pass in

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This balloon

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
In the process of rising and falling

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In the process of rising

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It will

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Its temperature will decrease

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Its volume will expand

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If the balloon moves down above

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It is

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The balloon will be compressed

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then the volume will shrink

320
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then the temperature will rise

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is a

323
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is the atmosphere

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Theorem or we use this concept to push us

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
To understand that

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey, what is this atmosphere like?

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Uh, I just talked about

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What I just said is that

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Hey, our atmosphere is actually layered

331
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That is, each layer of atmosphere

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In fact, it has

333
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It has a temperature

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So how do we measure this temperature?

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Uh

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Uh, is the atmosphere stable?

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Integrated

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh, the atmosphere

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Assuming it is stable

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then integrate the first law of thermodynamics that we just used

342
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We can actually deduce

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A thing called

344
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Uh, it's right here

345
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And this thing on top is

346
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I was given

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was shown to my friends

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I was shown to people who were interested in the equation

349
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Then I won't go into the equation room to talk too much

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why is this value important?

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We can see that it is the middle line

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This cloud

354
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oops

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
His concept is that our atmosphere is stable

358
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If it goes up by 1 km

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Down 9.8 degrees

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's a bit like saying

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If we have a 30 degree C balloon on the surface today

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Then this balloon

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
When we move it to 2000 meters

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It will drop 20 degrees

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So it's 10 degrees

366
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When it goes up to 4,000 meters

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It will drop another 20 degrees

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So he is

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Negative 10 degrees

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's it

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uh, vertical distribution

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's what we just talked about

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The first law of thermodynamics tells us

374
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The result is that in the same process

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The balloon

376
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's going up 2,000 meters, going down 10 degrees, and then it's going to explode

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And then it goes down

378
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It will go up another 2,000 meters, it will go down another 20 degrees

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And then it will explode again

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What about the idea he told us?

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's the other two

382
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That is, uh, if I say

383
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Today's temperature drops slower

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
For example, this case on the left

385
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's 30 degrees on the surface

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's 15 degrees at 2,000 meters

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That means this case is stable

388
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Because if I put

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
30 degrees of this

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's the balloon at 30 degrees on the surface

391
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you move it up 2,000 meters

392
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It will be 10 degrees

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So it will be colder

394
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But my environment is

395
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Uh, 15 degrees

396
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So the colder air

397
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Relatively hot air

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It will sink

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So the case on the left is stable

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because you move 30 degrees to 2,000 meters

401
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It will be 10 degrees

402
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So the environment is 15 degrees

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So this air will sink

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's relatively stable

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Then we are more interesting

406
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Of course it's the case on the other side

407
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's the temperature it drops

408
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's every 2,000 meters

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The drop in temperature is more than 20 degrees

410
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's the case on the right

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's 30 degrees to 2,000 meters

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It will drop 25 degrees

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Then go back to this value reduction rate

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Just the middle line

415
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I found out that this is

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
10 degrees

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But if I drop 25 degrees

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It means 25 degrees

419
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That is

420
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The air I moved up

421
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In fact, it is relatively light

422
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So it will continue to run up

423
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What about this structure

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's actually unstable

425
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That means

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Uh, if I

427
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Over this value reduction rate

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's the temperature that drops more

429
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's unstable

430
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Um, let me think about it

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uh, here we are

432
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's the idea of stability and instability

433
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This idea is in the atmosphere

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If we only consider dry air

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It has a dry straight line

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The one in the middle is my reference state

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a relatively stable state

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then you just have to be

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
More stable than reference state

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's more stable

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's more stable than reference

442
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It will be adjusted to

443
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's reference state

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's go to the next page

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Next page

446
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Here is a more common one

447
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a common concept in the atmosphere

448
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's called temperature

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's actually

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If it's in a more common field

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In a more common scientific field

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We will use

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's the natural

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That natural injury

455
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But here we don't have to talk about

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How to reverse injury operation

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The concept we want to use is

458
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If we don't give

459
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If we don't heat up our system

460
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Then his injury will be stable

461
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
that

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We say temperature or injury is stable

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh, conservative

464
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In fact, it means

465
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Hey, we didn't heat it up

466
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No quality exchange

467
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
In fact, it is conservative

468
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then you can go back to the picture of that page

469
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Just the picture of that page

470
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
After we calculate its temperature

471
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In fact, you can get a

472
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A simpler concept is

473
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If my temperature

474
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
On each vertical layer

475
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's all

476
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If it's a constant

477
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Then the air on this layer is stable

478
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's neutral

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's neutral

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Then if its

481
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Temperature increases with height

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For example, the one on the left

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It was 30 degrees, 15 degrees and negative 5

484
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It is 303 308

485
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And 313

486
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Its absolute temperature increases with the water

487
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It means that this layer is stable

488
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's the other side

489
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's on the right

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Its temperature decreases with height

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's not stable

492
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay, this one

493
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is a

494
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's kind of a good idea

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We can know right away

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that

497
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The atmosphere is

498
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That is, if we know its temperature

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We can know right away

500
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That is, if we know its temperature

501
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We can know right away

502
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The whole thing is stable or not

503
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That

504
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We are in

505
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
In everyday life

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Or when we just observed the balloon

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We just know

508
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We're going to convert it back to its temperature

509
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Most of the time

510
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The air is stable

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because it's all

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's the middle or the left side of this case

513
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because if it's unstable

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It will have a flow and then let

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The hot air goes up and the cold air comes down

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Then it will go back to

517
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Stable state

518
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is a bit like

519
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
As long as

520
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
As long as we have bad guys

521
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then the bad guys will be

522
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Be

523
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Everyone is trained to be a better person

524
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In this way, in the end

525
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In our environment

526
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You'll see more

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's all stable

528
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This state

529
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it is good

530
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
it is good

531
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Wait a minute

532
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, this one

533
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I want to ask a question

534
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I want to ask a question

535
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay, I think I think

536
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I think this is a good one

537
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think this is a good one

538
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That cutting point is

539
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you have any questions here

540
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you have any questions here

541
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think we can

542
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Pause

543
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Pause

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay, I'm just asking a very

545
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Okay, I'm just asking a very

546
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It should be

547
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is the professional field

548
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I think it's a boring question

549
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is the 303 you talked about

550
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
308 313k

551
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is SETA

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is SETA

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
OK

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Sorry

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is the so-called temperature, right?

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, it is the so-called temperature

557
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But actually we are in

558
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This is what we often use in the field

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Using kelvin

560
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Use absolute temperature to express

561
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
This why I use absolute temperature

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The reason is because

563
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It can be different from the temperature

564
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Such

565
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Its unit is

567
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Use

568
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes

569
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Use temperature to express temperature

570
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
OK

571
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it is good

572
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Just up

573
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Just up to this point

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The concept is that it is

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Uh

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not

577
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not water

578
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
it is good

579
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
After the water is involved

580
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The problem will become more complicated

581
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then we can know that

582
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
In the balloon just now

583
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If we catch it now

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In the air of the earth

585
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It will have gas oxygen carbon dioxide

586
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Then it will also have water

587
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's why

588
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
For example, people living in the United States

589
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It will feel that the air is dry

590
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Because its water may be less

591
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
People in Taiwan

592
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I feel that there is more water

593
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is the abundance of water

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In fact, in addition to affecting the comfort of our life

595
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
In addition

596
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It will also affect the stability of the atmosphere

597
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The picture on the right

598
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It was also caught by me in Wikipedia

599
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This thing is

600
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This story is like this

601
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Uh

602
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We are in the process of atmospheric vertical movement

603
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In the process of atmospheric vertical movement

604
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The temperature will be

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The temperature will be reduced

606
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In the process of temperature reduction

607
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He will encounter a situation

608
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The temperature is low

609
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The water will freeze

610
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's a bit like we're in the air

611
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's a bit like the state of fog

612
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that is

613
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If the air cools down quickly

614
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That water

615
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Uh

616
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The water is the water

617
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The frozen water pressure is on the right

618
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Will

619
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Will

620
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Will let the steam

621
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Become

622
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Atmospheric water

623
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That process

624
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Uh he

625
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He is not linear

626
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He needs a more complicated formula to calculate

627
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Then this process is actually more

628
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's more difficult to capture

629
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's more difficult to understand

630
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's it

631
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So when we think about water

632
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Just mentioned earlier

633
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The process of stability

634
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There is a new one

635
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There is a new interpretation

636
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That is, when water becomes steam

637
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
When it becomes steam

638
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It will release some heat

639
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What about the first law of thermodynamics we just learned

640
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There will be one

641
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There will be a heating on our right

642
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
On the right

643
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So our up and down adjustment process

644
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Also add

645
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The adjustment of the heat of the water

646
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then we can get another one

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's the ratio of cooling

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's the ratio of cooling when there's water

649
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He usually calls us this

650
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's called visual heat reduction rate

651
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That is, you can imagine that he is

652
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Moisture lapse rate

653
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
When there is water

654
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We have another cooling rate

655
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Then his cooling rate is more

656
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Smaller

657
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's just dry

658
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It drops by 9.8 degrees per kilometer

659
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But when you have water

660
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It only drops by about 6 degrees per kilometer

661
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then there is a thing here

662
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Just a little reminder

663
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Uh 9.8

664
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Just that 9.8 degrees

665
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because the formula he calculated is a constant

666
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So

667
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Uh

668
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It won't change with the height

669
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That visual heat reduction rate

670
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This 6.5 is a estimate value

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's a non-linear value

672
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So you can think about this company is so complicated

673
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Then it will change with the height

674
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So 6.5 is a kind of estimate value

675
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Then follow

676
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
With different heights

677
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It has different

678
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The gradient

679
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Then in the process

680
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We can at the same time

681
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Define another temperature

682
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Is related to

683
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Water

684
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This temperature is called

685
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Uh, relative temperature

686
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Relative temperature

687
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Relative temperature is also

688
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can think of it as a wet temperature

689
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
After adding water vapor

690
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
He can get the result

691
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That

692
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because the water vapor is really complicated

693
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Then we can see that

694
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's wet

695
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The relative temperature equation is here

696
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Then I don't have to explain

697
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What's in it

698
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But he

699
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It is a fairly complicated value

700
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Very complicated calculation

701
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But if we calculate

702
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
After this relative temperature value

703
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
He actually

704
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The concept of application will be quite simple

705
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
it is good

706
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it is good

707
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Then

708
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Next we want to introduce

709
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Is that we want to introduce

710
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
When there is water vapor

711
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The atmosphere will have a

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Another state occurs

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It is called

714
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Unstable condition

715
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That

716
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Uh, what about this picture

717
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If we don't look

718
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't look at this part of the unstable condition

719
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Just look at this

720
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The part of the dry heat dissipation rate

721
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We can go back to just

722
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Just review

723
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The result we just got

724
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
If our cooling rate

725
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Uh, this gamma is its cooling rate

726
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
must

727
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
that is

728
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
This symbol is upside down

729
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That is, we are lower than the temperature

730
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If the temperature of the dry heat dissipation rate is more than

731
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Or if our temperature is

732
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If the water level is low, this

733
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
This is our atmosphere

734
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Unstable

735
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Then what if

736
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Uh, the other condition is

737
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
If our atmosphere is

738
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
More than this

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If the cooling rate is lower

740
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It is stable

741
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So on the other side

742
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Relatively stable

743
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Uh, this side

744
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it is good

745
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But when we have water vapor

746
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
After considering

747
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What about

748
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What about

749
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We have another condition

750
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Unstable occurrence

751
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The situation in the unstable condition is

752
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Uh, it's in the cooling rate

753
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's in

754
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Uh, let me see

755
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's in the middle of negative 9.8 to negative 6.5

756
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because there's a negative sign here

757
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So it's

758
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm easy to get this wrong

759
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I was right

760
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I just

761
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Ten minutes before the start

762
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Ten minutes to change the first film

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I changed it wrong

764
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So here's a condition

765
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The unstable situation is

766
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
In the middle

767
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Its atmosphere is actually

768
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Unstable

769
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Then it will adjust to

770
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
To this stability

771
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That is to say

772
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If it has water vapor

773
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Or if it has

774
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If it has water vapor

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It will be

776
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Unstable conditions

777
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It will produce flow

778
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
What about the formula for its judgment

779
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
In fact, you can see

780
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Imagine that it is the temperature

781
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Is increasing with the height

782
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But its

783
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Relatively low temperature is decreasing with the height

784
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's the case

785
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In fact, it meets

786
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Unstable

787
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The conditions

788
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Uh

789
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Uh, good

790
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm going to

791
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm going to

792
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm going to

793
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm going to

794
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm going to

795
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm going to

796
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm not sure if this is a very complicated

797
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The idea

798
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But we go to the next page

799
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This idea will be relatively useful

800
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ok, now we finally have to see

801
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What is the heat generation

802
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
What about the heat generation

803
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh

804
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Its situation is

805
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If we are on a ocean

806
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This ocean will absorb radiation from the sun

807
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then it will heat our surface

808
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And then there's another thing

809
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
When a object has temperature

810
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It will have long-wave radiation

811
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
A lot of radiation

812
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The radiation goes out

813
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Will send the heat out

814
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So it will produce a

815
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Is

816
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
System

817
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Then there will be heat coming in and heat going out

818
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And then

819
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Uh, we only rely on radiation

820
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Its heat cannot be adjusted to a stable state

821
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So it will have a flow to help

822
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The whole atmosphere is adjusted

823
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That's our

824
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Uh, the story

825
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Simplified, simplified, simplified version

826
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Of course, in the atmosphere

827
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It will have

828
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The difference in the ocean

829
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And then it will have different

830
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Uh, background

831
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Atmospheric circulation

832
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And then it will have

833
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Maybe there are a lot of people doing air glue

834
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Uh, there will be different physical phenomena

835
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Will affect

836
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's the change of the heat generation

837
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But what I'm talking about here is a bit like his

838
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Is that you can do everything

839
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Ignore the parts that can be ignored

840
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What you can get is

841
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This system I just talked about

842
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That right

843
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This is a picture from the textbook

844
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What it describes is

845
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Its y-axis is the height

846
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Then its x-axis is from 90 degrees south to 90 degrees north

847
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it's a

848
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Uh, I put every

849
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The upper temperature of the latitude is

850
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Average value

851
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So this is the latitude above

852
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Then the following is the latitude

853
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then we can see the latitude value

854
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's just that it's not very clear

855
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But its latitude

856
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
In fact, it is increased by the height of the water, so it means that

857
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We are in the channel or in the heat generation atmosphere

858
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The temperature is increased by the height of the water

859
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Which

860
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Uh, in line with what we just saw

861
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This condition

862
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The temperature is increased by the height of the water

863
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
What about the following picture

864
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Is quite low temperature

865
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Then we can see that in the heat generation area

866
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
In fact, it's all the same value

867
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It means

868
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
In the heat generation atmosphere

869
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Its relative temperature is actually

870
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A constant is a constant with the height

871
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That means most of the time it is maintained

872
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In a state that has just been adjusted

873
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Or it's a neutral state

874
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There must be a process

875
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
In the process is

876
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Uh, solar heating or other non-thermal processes

877
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Put

878
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This atmosphere becomes unstable

879
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then it is adjusted by the flow

880
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Stable

881
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then this picture tells us that in fact

882
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This flow is in

883
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It is very common in the heat generation atmosphere

884
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's just that it's a very common phenomenon

885
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That's why

886
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
My research is to study the process of wet flow

887
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
How is it

888
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
it is good

889
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The next page is

890
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Uh, this page is

891
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I call it magic step

892
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Just

893
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Uh, we want to understand this system

894
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But the atmosphere system is actually very complicated

895
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just said

896
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If you want to consider everything

897
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You want to consider

898
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You want to consider

899
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Uh, water, you want to consider B, you want to consider rain, you want to consider radiation

900
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
All this process you will

901
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You will write out a super complicated

902
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Mathematical model

903
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Then you will

904
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
A super complicated fluid model, you have to consider the density, you have to consider all kinds of changes

905
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But I actually went back to it

906
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm in the traditional flow problem

907
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Plus

908
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
A simplified state equation

909
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
To describe that if today

910
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Produce

911
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When it is saturated

912
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
How will its heat release change?

913
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
This simple equation

914
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Replaced by a very complicated thermal equation

915
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Or replaced by a very complicated

916
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The process of microphysis is to simplify everything

917
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Simplify to me

918
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's only saturated and then it's unstable

919
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
In this state

920
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
To write out

921
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This equation

922
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Give

923
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Give

924
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's just a little bit more information

925
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This time it's not a fluid

926
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's just that it's simplified like this

927
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Then it is driven by buoyancy

928
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The whole system

929
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Then we

930
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Uh, this

931
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
This, this is to use the temperature and the relative temperature to adjust its buoyancy

932
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That

933
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's not it

934
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is not

935
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
This is not the original form in my original paper

936
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But it's very close

937
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We can look at that form

938
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then he also

939
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
For super super good people in thermodynamics

940
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is not a very exact

941
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This is not

942
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
A very exact equation

943
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and so

944
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
If you need more details

945
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's what we'll discuss later

946
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Then why can we do this

947
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Why can we do this equation

948
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Can help us understand

949
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It should be said

950
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Or what kind of simplification did I do?

951
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's what we just said

952
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The atmosphere is actually on the ocean

953
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Then he has the top of the fluid

954
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Then he is

955
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There is no lid on the top of the fluid

956
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But I put the fluid in two lids

957
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Oops

958
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Put it in two lids

959
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then I add

960
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Plus the process of condensation

961
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then I add the unstable

962
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This fluid

963
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Unstable conditions

964
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This condition is not a condition

965
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Unstable condition

966
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This state

967
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I gave him a relatively low temperature

968
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then he is

969
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The low temperature is greater than zero

970
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Give him this condition

971
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Then if it meets some conditions

972
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It will produce

973
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
That is, it will be saturated and release heat

974
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Simply put

975
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Inside my model

976
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If it is saturated, it will go

977
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Its buoyancy is determined by its relative low temperature

978
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So it is unstable

979
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
If I say my model

980
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I judge it is

981
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It is stable without saturation

982
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So this

983
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
To some extent

984
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It meets the condition of instability

985
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This state is

986
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Stable without saturation

987
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Stable with saturation

988
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Then this

989
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What about such a fluid

990
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
In fact, it will

991
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It needs a distribution

992
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It won't be a

993
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's me today

994
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Just pull a balloon up

995
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I know that there is saturation here

996
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
There is no saturation here

997
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It will be a

998
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It is

999
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It will be a

1000
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Distribution

1001
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Some places have flow

1002
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Some places have no flow

1003
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It is going down

1004
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Some places are going up

1005
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Then there is an animation on the bottom page

1006
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This is my simulation animation

1007
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Then I think this animation can give you some

1008
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The idea is to know

1009
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What is this flow

1010
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's the same as if

1011
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is the same as what we know

1012
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The atmosphere model is quite similar

1013
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Or if it is

1014
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A little bit like the weather phenomenon we know

1015
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
At the beginning I gave some

1016
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Just random perturbation

1017
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Then after a while

1018
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It will have a flow

1019
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
In this process

1020
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
By the way, let me describe

1021
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What is my model

1022
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
This is my

1023
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The equation above me just now

1024
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Is to use

1025
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Uncompressible package

1026
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Uncompressible program to

1027
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Solve the above equation

1028
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Then this

1029
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The program is

1030
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Can have

1031
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Is adaptive mesh

1032
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm not sure what to say

1033
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It can be mesh

1034
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Detailed to

1035
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Can have dynamic mesh

1036
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Then it is in

1037
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Ccse developed by Perkin Lab

1038
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then if

1039
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
For those of you who have studied the numerical method

1040
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It is the numerical method of

1041
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The

1042
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Then

1043
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Solve

1044
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Under the condition that it is uncompressible

1045
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We use approximate projection

1046
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Is to use a method to solve

1047
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Just

1048
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Solve this limitation of uncompressible flow

1049
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Then we can see

1050
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
This is the addition of rotation

1051
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So

1052
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So after a while

1053
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Numerical simulation

1054
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Then the random flow we just talked about

1055
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Will become

1056
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like a typhoon

1057
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
This kind of spiral

1058
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What about this spiral

1059
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
In fact, it is

1060
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
There are many similar places to typhoons

1061
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Then it will

1062
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It will also die

1063
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Then it will grow a new flow

1064
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then it has

1065
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Is that it has an upper and lower layer

1066
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We can talk about the upper layer area

1067
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The upper layer area is the typhoon

1068
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That lower layer area is

1069
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's just that there is no water here

1070
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The place is its lower layer area

1071
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That

1072
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This simplified model

1073
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm not sure if I can convince everyone

1074
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It is to some extent

1075
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Captured a lot of atmospheric features

1076
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That

1077
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
We use

1078
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
To understand this simplified model

1079
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
To understand that

1080
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The original atmosphere

1081
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Or what is the atmosphere

1082
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Come

1083
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Come and do further research

1084
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That

1085
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's go to the next page

1086
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I haven't jumped to the next page yet

1087
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Then we have some more

1088
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Simple

1089
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It should be said that it is not simple

1090
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Anyway, it is more

1091
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Uh

1092
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
A more static picture to see

1093
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Look at what my simulation results tell us

1094
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Or

1095
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What are these things

1096
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Is related to atmospheric

1097
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Similar

1098
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That

1099
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The two on the left are

1100
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Uh

1101
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
A time screenshot

1102
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That left

1103
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Uh

1104
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
What about this A picture

1105
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It is not

1106
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
No rotation

1107
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The right one has rotation

1108
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Then we can see that there is no rotation

1109
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It will have

1110
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Is the ascending area

1111
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There are some currents in

1112
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
In

1113
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
In

1114
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Inside my simulation area

1115
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Then there is another place

1116
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Is the descent area

1117
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This way

1118
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Then the other side of the picture is

1119
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I put the rotation into my

1120
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
In the simulation conditions

1121
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It will produce a vortex like a typhoon

1122
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Good

1123
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You will see a few

1124
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Several such

1125
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Vortex

1126
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Okay, then I put these vortexes

1127
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Go to the mirror

1128
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Is to do

1129
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Along its

1130
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Half into the average

1131
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We can see a lot

1132
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Some features like typhoons

1133
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let's take a look at the above

1134
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
This picture

1135
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It is

1136
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It is

1137
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The color is the vertical speed

1138
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So it will have

1139
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The speed of the center rise

1140
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It will also have

1141
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There is a descent in the center

1142
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's a bit like a typhoon

1143
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Typhoon eye

1144
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The other one

1145
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Is contour

1146
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Its horizontal line

1147
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Is

1148
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The content of liquid water

1149
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So it rises in the center

1150
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
There are more liquid water

1151
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So this is like us

1152
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't understand typhoons

1153
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We have also seen the satellite image of typhoons

1154
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Is in the center of the typhoon

1155
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There will be a lot of clouds

1156
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
There will be a lot of water and a lot of rain

1157
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So this is to some extent

1158
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Close to our understanding of typhoons

1159
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
What about the next one

1160
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Is

1161
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Uh, it's a typhoon

1162
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Mirror wind and oblique wind

1163
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Is

1164
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There is a lower layer

1165
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That

1166
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The color is the mirror wind

1167
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It has

1168
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The lower layer is from the outside

1169
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Into the typhoon center

1170
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The wind

1171
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Then it will decrease with the height

1172
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It will fly out from the upper layer

1173
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The upper layer flows out

1174
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Then this is accompanied by

1175
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Is the oblique wind

1176
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That this

1177
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
In the atmosphere

1178
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It meets some

1179
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Uh, what is this

1180
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Is the slope wind

1181
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The slope wind

1182
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What is the slope wind

1183
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is the slope wind

1184
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The

1185
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The

1186
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The model is like this

1187
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What about the third picture

1188
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It is

1189
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Uh, it's quite unsteady

1190
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
With its angular momentum

1191
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That in

1192
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
There is a famous paper in the atmosphere

1193
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It has a narrative

1194
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Say it is

1195
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
A narrative

1196
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Uh, an ideal spiral

1197
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Its angular momentum

1198
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
With its relative unsteady

1199
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
To some extent

1200
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Just his

1201
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The line must be relatively parallel

1202
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That

1203
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
In this result

1204
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
In this part

1205
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It is also relatively parallel

1206
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So it means that this spiral

1207
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It is with

1208
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It is quite similar to the ideal typhoon model

1209
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it is good

1210
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
it is good

1211
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is the last picture with information

1212
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This picture is also a little bit complicated

1213
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But

1214
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Uh, I think the reason I want to show this picture is because

1215
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because we talked about so much in the front

1216
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Wei Wen talked so much about injury

1217
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That this picture is actually the concept of application injury

1218
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
To divide my level

1219
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That is, I put the injury of each level

1220
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Every block of different injuries

1221
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Collected

1222
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then go and say

1223
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
My

1224
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The atmosphere of my different injuries

1225
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
In the end, the blocks of different injuries

1226
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
How is it distributed

1227
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Okay, what about this one above?

1228
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The above one is

1229
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Uh, its distribution

1230
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
There is a white line here

1231
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
If you can see it, it is

1232
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It is

1233
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Uh, the condensation line

1234
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That is, if I am in

1235
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The upper right of this line represents these air

1236
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Is condensed

1237
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
These blocks are condensed

1238
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Then there is no condensation below

1239
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Then we can find out

1240
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
In

1241
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
If there is no rotation

1242
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Inside the case is

1243
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Uh, this

1244
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
This kind of

1245
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Under this state

1246
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Most of it

1247
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The air is not condensed

1248
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Then there will be a small part of it

1249
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Is condensed

1250
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Uh, the condensed air is relatively small

1251
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Then

1252
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
In addition, if there is a spiral

1253
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It has more

1254
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Less proportion

1255
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
There will be an upward spiral

1256
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Then there are more parts of the lower layer

1257
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So its upper layer

1258
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The upper and lower layers are more open

1259
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
This is the lower layer area

1260
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Then this is the upper layer area

1261
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Then there is no

1262
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The upper layer area without rotation is here

1263
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So its upper and lower

1264
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The upper and lower areas can be separated

1265
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Then below this is a

1266
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
In uh

1267
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
A fairly low temperature

1268
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It can distinguish its upper and lower

1269
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What is it like in a vertical movement

1270
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
that

1271
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Uh, when there is a rotation

1272
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
His upper body is

1273
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
More will not be

1274
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Uh environment to

1275
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Mix is if he

1276
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It should be said that his upper body movement is better protected

1277
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So his upper body

1278
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's just that his heat transmission efficiency is

1279
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
More effective

1280
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Then this

1281
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This way of analysis is actually

1282
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Is a

1283
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I think it's a bit smart

1284
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No, it's not

1285
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Because this is not my way

1286
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
This is my boss's way

1287
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He provided everyone with a

1288
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Provided everyone with a

1289
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
To understand from the point of view of injury

1290
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hey, what about our big team

1291
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that

1292
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Cut back on the idea at the beginning

1293
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Just when i have

1294
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Something with a bigger benefit

1295
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Or something with a bigger injury

1296
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
When the block is running up

1297
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That

1298
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The smaller block of the injury is running down

1299
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But he has one

1300
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Is relatively wet

1301
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
The air block has more potential to run up

1302
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Relatively dry block

1303
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He just runs down

1304
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
This picture tells us to some extent

1305
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
This thing

1306
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Okay, today

1307
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I think my sharing is probably here

1308
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Then there are a few things to remind everyone

1309
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Is lapse rate

1310
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Is

1311
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The value reduction rate is directly affected

1312
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Directly related to our climate change

1313
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Is if you

1314
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Just said

1315
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If these things don't make sense to you

1316
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Then we can still go back to one thing

1317
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That is, lapse rate is actually

1318
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Our background

1319
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Our

1320
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Stability

1321
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Our physical structure is there

1322
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
He won't change because of climate change

1323
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Add two degrees

1324
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That

1325
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So

1326
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Lapse rate is really

1327
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Directly related to climate change

1328
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Then the second thing is

1329
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Uh

1330
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Just now we talked about heat and air

1331
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Is a relatively complex process

1332
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Is that he has

1333
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Various things

1334
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Then the stability of light is so complicated

1335
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You can imagine

1336
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If we consider all kinds of different physics

1337
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
For example, consider radiation

1338
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Consider microphysics

1339
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Consider gas

1340
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
How complicated it can become

1341
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Then I will

1342
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
My research is counterproductive

1343
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I will take all these complicated things

1344
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Take it all

1345
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Then

1346
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
After simplifying this mode

1347
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Then use numerical simulation

1348
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
To solve

1349
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
To

1350
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
To solve this equation

1351
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
To understand that this

1352
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Rise and fall

1353
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
How to distribute

1354
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Then this mode

1355
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
He has another advantage

1356
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Is that he can make it soundless

1357
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The analysis becomes simpler

1358
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That

1359
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Of course I don't want to talk about this today

1360
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This part

1361
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But it is

1362
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Is a simplified mode

1363
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Then he can give us a lot

1364
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Different information

1365
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Then the last one

1366
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Take home message is

1367
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Uh, wet flow

1368
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The thing is

1369
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Wet things go up

1370
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Dry things come down

1371
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That uh

1372
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In case this

1373
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This sentence doesn't make sense

1374
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It doesn't make sense to everyone

1375
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is that we have a cloud

1376
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The place is rising

1377
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Then there are many places

1378
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's downstream

1379
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's downstream

1380
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The place is much more than the place that rises

1381
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Then this is a feature of wet flow

1382
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That

1383
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Uh, maybe some friends who do flow

1384
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He will say

1385
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
His flow is

1386
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The rise and fall are symmetrical

1387
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That wet flow is

1388
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's not symmetrical

1389
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And the wet flow has a very clear boundary

1390
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Cut up the rise and fall

1391
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The more you cut

1392
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Your wet flow

1393
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Then my speech is here

1394
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Then thank you very much

1395
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Thank you for coming

1396
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Then thank you very much

1397
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Friends who helped me watch the video

1398
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
such

1399
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Thank you for your speech

1400
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Thank you

1401
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Is there anyone here who wants to ask questions?

1402
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Anyway, everyone can ask directly

1403
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You can chat directly

1404
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yes yes yes yes yes

1405
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I have a question

1406
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Hello

1407
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Hi

1408
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That you just said

1409
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
This thing

1410
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
With your temperature

1411
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
In the case of climate change

1412
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Um

1413
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Is it that it won't change?

1414
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Wet flow will not change

1415
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's kind of like you're getting warmer

1416
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But your wet flow rate is still there

1417
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That is, it

1418
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The wet flow rate comes from the physics equation

1419
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It won't change because of your temperature increase

1420
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's kind of like

1421
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Like first derivative

1422
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That is, you are dividing

1423
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
To determine its gradient

1424
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's it

1425
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is my understanding

1426
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I don't know

1427
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I instinctively think

1428
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't quite agree with this sentence

1429
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
because

1430
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Our atmosphere

1431
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Unless you are an ideal atmosphere

1432
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's dry

1433
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Of course it's dry and hot

1434
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yes

1435
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Especially in hot areas

1436
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
There is water

1437
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
The water will change as the climate changes

1438
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes

1439
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So you are in the atmosphere

1440
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The distribution of water will also change in the atmosphere

1441
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes

1442
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I think I think

1443
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
When there is wet

1444
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The thing when it's wet is

1445
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's different

1446
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I agree

1447
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That is, if there is

1448
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The process of water

1449
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This thing is completely different

1450
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yes

1451
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yes

1452
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It should be said that this is why

1453
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
This is why

1454
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Wet flow is very complicated

1455
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So why

1456
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Why do I want to simplify this model

1457
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
To see

1458
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
If I only look at

1459
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Only look at

1460
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Only look at the simplified

1461
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The buoyancy structure

1462
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What will it be

1463
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Will

1464
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
What are the different things

1465
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
OK

1466
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Then I think this sentence should

1467
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Your take-home message

1468
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The first sentence should be

1469
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The dry

1470
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Left side

1471
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Dry right

1472
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It won't change

1473
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yes

1474
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's a major issue

1475
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yes

1476
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So it's dry

1477
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It won't change

1478
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But if it's visual

1479
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If it's hot

1480
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes

1481
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It will change

1482
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yes

1483
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That's right

1484
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
No change

1485
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Then we can go back to your

1486
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Is that the projection of the simplified model just now?

1487
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
it is good

1488
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Come here

1489
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yes

1490
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Ah

1491
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So your model is

1492
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Assuming

1493
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In a

1494
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
In an unstable environment

1495
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That's right

1496
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Then

1497
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Ah

1498
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
If

1499
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
In the process of a block rise

1500
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
As long as it

1501
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Fluid

1502
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
As long as its water reaches

1503
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The amount of water that can hold its temperature

1504
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yes

1505
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It will be condensed

1506
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes

1507
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
When the condensation occurs

1508
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Ah

1509
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
In fact

1510
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
In fact

1511
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's not that complicated

1512
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm just thinking

1513
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm just thinking

1514
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This is the 1960s

1515
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That

1516
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That

1517
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You know that very simple

1518
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That one

1519
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What's the difference in flow parameters?

1520
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I

1521
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think

1522
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I think it's a bit

1523
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'll just talk about my concept

1524
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's just

1525
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's actually a little bit simpler than you just said

1526
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I think

1527
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I think it's a little bit simpler than what I just said

1528
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Because my

1529
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I give my

1530
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The upper and lower boundaries are actually in a state of saturation

1531
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Then

1532
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Ah

1533
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Then

1534
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
There is a condition that I just mentioned

1535
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
If it is saturated

1536
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
There is a buoyancy below

1537
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This equation

1538
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
In fact, it is

1539
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It is

1540
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If it is saturated

1541
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It is the visual heat

1542
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If it is not saturated, it is the dry heat

1543
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The process of dry heat

1544
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So it's actually

1545
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It's actually not that I

1546
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It makes it easier to judge the saturation

1547
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's so simple that there's only one maximum to judge this thing

1548
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So

1549
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Then

1550
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Then what do I want to do?

1551
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Then

1552
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Because the boundary conditions are fixed over there

1553
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's not like I'm giving it

1554
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's not like the traditional atmospheric mode

1555
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm giving the temperature to the humidity

1556
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The volume to decide

1557
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Hey, my atmospheric mode is exactly what I gave

1558
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
How many

1559
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Things are in the mode

1560
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
In fact, it is

1561
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I

1562
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's a bit like I'm giving

1563
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm giving

1564
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then I give

1565
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
In fact, I am giving benefits

1566
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It was originally written with benefits

1567
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
This is why I want to do benefits in the first page

1568
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It is

1569
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Use benefits to drive the whole mode

1570
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Then I give the volume of benefits to decide

1571
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Hey, it's not stable

1572
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And then in the case of instability

1573
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
How do I distribute things

1574
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You've already published this result, haven't you?

1575
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Hey

1576
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
In the province

1577
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I got minor revision

1578
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So

1579
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
OK

1580
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Maybe I'll have to look for it later

1581
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
To understand the details

1582
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah, I think we can

1583
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Hey, will you go to that?

1584
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Hurricane Conference

1585
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Which one is it?

1586
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Hey

1587
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
May

1588
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The beginning of May is the Tropical Meteorology

1589
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay, let's talk about it then

1590
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
OK

1591
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Thank you

1592
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah, this one

1593
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This

1594
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I think it's

1595
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
He simplified

1596
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Too many things

1597
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
With

1598
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
He even

1599
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
He even

1600
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Should be

1601
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Just

1602
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
He is much more simplified than the cloud

1603
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
such

1604
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Is there any problem here?

1605
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If not

1606
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can ask

1607
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Just on this picture

1608
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
why

1609
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I want to understand

1610
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This is Tropical Meteorology

1611
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Why are the upper and lower boundaries saturated?

1612
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You have to calculate it as saturated

1613
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Calculated as saturated

1614
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Isn't it raining already?

1615
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Hey

1616
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Hey

1617
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Hey

1618
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Hey

1619
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Isn't it raining already?

1620
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Hey

1621
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Hey

1622
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Hey

1623
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Hey

1624
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Hey

1625
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Is it Rainy here?

1626
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Hey

1627
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Hey

1628
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Hey

1629
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Hey

1630
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Hey

1631
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Hey

1632
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The floor

1633
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Hey

1634
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Hey

1635
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Hey

1636
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's raining

1637
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So it's a bit like

1638
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Because it can simplify a little bit of the problem

1639
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So let it become a little bit more simplified

1640
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Then

1641
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Another more practical reason

1642
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is that we found out in the previous research

1643
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
If the lower boundary is saturated and the upper boundary is not saturated

1644
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Its stability is actually relatively stable

1645
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It will be stable in the end

1646
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Then its simulation is relatively boring

1647
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It won't have a stable flow

1648
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So why do we set the upper and lower boundaries to be stable

1649
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
One reason is that it can produce a more interesting result

1650
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Then another reason is that it can simplify

1651
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It can simplify what we are doing

1652
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It can reduce a variable when it is analyzed five times

1653
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Sorry

1654
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because I don't understand at all

1655
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So what I want to understand is

1656
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
This is more in line with the actual physical situation

1657
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The bottom is the sea

1658
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Then the top

1659
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The bottom sea is saturated

1660
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This I seem to understand

1661
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yes yes yes

1662
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Then the top

1663
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's actually not that consistent

1664
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
To be honest, it's not that consistent

1665
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But

1666
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I should say that I can add a little more

1667
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
The reason it is consistent is

1668
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
If you look at this cloud

1669
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
If it goes up to the top

1670
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
To some extent

1671
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
If there is a cloud, it is still relatively saturated

1672
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So if the upper boundary is saturated

1673
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It didn't lose too much

1674
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Is related to what we originally assumed

1675
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If there is still a cloud on it

1676
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It is basically saturated

1677
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Of course, in the real atmosphere, it is the top of the stream

1678
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Its water volume is relatively difficult

1679
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Through the top of the stream to the bottom of the stream

1680
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Of course, you should say that in this situation

1681
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
If there is a lot of water on the top of the stream

1682
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
There are a lot of clouds like this

1683
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
In fact, it is not too far from the saturation

1684
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So in fact, having a cloud means that it is already close to saturation

1685
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It should be said that there is a cloud

1686
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In fact, it is called that it is over-saturated

1687
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It will produce clouds

1688
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
The process of the water vapor that I just omitted is

1689
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
When I reach the saturation condition

1690
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
In fact, many times

1691
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Its water droplets will not freeze

1692
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It still needs to freeze

1693
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Water will freeze

1694
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Drops

1695
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then we have here

1696
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
In fact, there is an assumption that I did not mention

1697
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It is assumed that

1698
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Water is produced as soon as it reaches saturation

1699
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
In fact, this is done

1700
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Many people in the micro-physical process

1701
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
They will not make this assumption

1702
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh understand

1703
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Then I still have one more thing to understand today

1704
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I'm sorry, I have a lot of questions

1705
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Recently all asked

1706
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Because my question should be more obvious

1707
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll ask him first

1708
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
The first one is why

1709
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Your atmospheric simulation is incompressible fluid

1710
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
In fact, this is also a very good question

1711
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Because in atmospheric

1712
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
When we just talked about the cloud mode

1713
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It actually does not use incompressible

1714
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But it will use an elastic

1715
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It will make the density vertical

1716
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
This situation

1717
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That is

1718
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But it is basically incompressible

1719
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
If you do

1720
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
When that compressible analysis

1721
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You will find that the compressible amount

1722
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
In the system

1723
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Can

1724
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The contribution is very small

1725
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So it contributes less than

1726
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
10-2

1727
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So this result is what we do

1728
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Because when you do

1729
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
When you go to do compressible fluid

1730
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The price you need is very high

1731
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
For example, your time step will become very small

1732
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Then what you can solve becomes a lot less

1733
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So rather than

1734
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Spend a long time

1735
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
To do

1736
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Compressible to do that simple calculation

1737
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Why don't we take this compressible

1738
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
We can do a longer time

1739
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So a lot of atmospheric

1740
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
These discussions

1741
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Are all using incompressible

1742
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Gas?

1743
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
They have

1744
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
This is also a good question

1745
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
When doing incompressible

1746
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
In fact, there are different levels of incompressible

1747
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Some people's incompressible

1748
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Is divergent u is equal to 0

1749
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Then some people's incompressible

1750
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Is

1751
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Divergent rho u is equal to 0

1752
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is that it puts density

1753
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Vertically distributed

1754
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
This phenomenon

1755
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
What is u?

1756
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
u is

1757
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Speed is its three-dimensional speed

1758
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Its speed

1759
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Has

1760
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The density has

1761
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
This is the second

1762
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Relatively complicated

1763
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Then there is

1764
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
There is also

1765
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Divergent u is equal to

1766
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Its

1767
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Incompressibility

1768
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Related to the release of heat

1769
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
This is a little more complicated

1770
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Then there is

1771
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If you say

1772
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Its

1773
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Related to heat

1774
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
This is usually called pseudo-compressible

1775
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So it will have different levels of simplification

1776
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Of course, the more you consider

1777
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The more difficult your numerical model is

1778
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Never thought

1779
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Gas can use incompressible

1780
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
To consider

1781
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It has a little bit

1782
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It should be said that if you really use compressible

1783
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You can do a lot of things

1784
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Then

1785
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In fact, after talking about compressible

1786
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It has more simplification

1787
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
If your model is

1788
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Hydrostatic

1789
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Accurate

1790
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
If you do it

1791
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Will simplify more

1792
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The time you can simulate is longer

1793
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
But of course it is

1794
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You take this advantage

1795
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You have to sacrifice something

1796
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Then in my question

1797
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Its problem is not very good

1798
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It is a large area of ​​level

1799
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But its vertical movement is very important

1800
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So this is why

1801
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Choose such a simulation

1802
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It will choose

1803
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
For example, its horizontal grid

1804
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Is 1km x 1km

1805
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But its vertical may be a few hundred meters

1806
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
The last one I want to know

1807
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Why

1808
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Stable

1809
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Corresponds to

1810
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
There is a video in front of you

1811
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Adiabatic process

1812
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It means it is stable

1813
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Do you want to talk about this?

1814
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
This

1815
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Adiabatic

1816
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
My understanding is thermal

1817
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
What does it have to do with stable?

1818
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let me think about it

1819
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
If it is

1820
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
In fact, we have

1821
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Equation

1822
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We put hydrostatic plus

1823
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Adiabatic process

1824
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
We deduce the lapse rate

1825
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
If you have hydrostatic plus

1826
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Hydrostatic plus

1827
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Add that

1828
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Adiabatic

1829
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You will get this dry lapse rate

1830
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
In dry lapse rate

1831
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Your block can move up and down

1832
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Then it won't

1833
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Its movement is the same as the adiabatic process

1834
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Is consistent

1835
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
If your vertical distribution

1836
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Is the distribution of the adiabatic process

1837
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Then it is up and down

1838
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
In neutral state

1839
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I moved block A to block B

1840
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I found that these two blocks are the same

1841
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It means it won't

1842
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Change position

1843
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It won't run away

1844
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It means it is relatively neutral

1845
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But if you run to stable

1846
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
In stable case

1847
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You exchange blocks

1848
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It will return to its original position

1849
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It means it is stable

1850
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Dry lapse rate is a

1851
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Criterion

1852
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If you are more than dry lapse rate

1853
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It will become more unstable

1854
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So

1855
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
If you are less than dry lapse rate

1856
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It is relatively stable

1857
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So lapse rate is like

1858
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Stress hole

1859
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
If you are less than this stress hole

1860
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It is unstable

1861
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It is stable

1862
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So you mean

1863
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
When in a stable case

1864
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You just

1865
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Take a piece of air from the sky

1866
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Its

1867
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It will float

1868
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It is the same

1869
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
If it is dry lapse rate

1870
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It is the same

1871
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You have a profile

1872
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
If it is dry lapse rate

1873
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
If you take a normal air

1874
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Because it is stable

1875
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So you take an air from the sky

1876
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You wrap it with a balloon

1877
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Because when it comes down

1878
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It will compress

1879
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It will compress into a smaller air

1880
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
When you bring it to the ground

1881
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Because it passed the cooling process

1882
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Its cooling will be more

1883
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Because it is stable

1884
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
The air will float

1885
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The air will float

1886
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You mean

1887
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
The condition is

1888
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You

1889
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You put

1890
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
15°C

1891
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Put it

1892
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
200

1893
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
2 km

1894
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Its buoyancy is equal to 0

1895
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
These two things are the same

1896
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
This can be inferred

1897
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yes

1898
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
If

1899
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Let me think

1900
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
If you are on the lapse rate

1901
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
The whole block

1902
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Its buoyancy is equal to 0

1903
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It will not

1904
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It is not very good

1905
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It is trying to stabilize

1906
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Its buoyancy is equal to the weight of the block

1907
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yes

1908
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
This is quite interesting

1909
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You can look it up

1910
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Yes

1911
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
If

1912
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
If your institute has a book

1913
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You can refer to it

1914
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It is called atmospheric thermodynamics

1915
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
The series of books

1916
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
My question is finished

1917
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Thank you

1918
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Is there any professional question here?

1919
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
No?

1920
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I will turn off the recording

1921
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Thank you

1922
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Thank you
