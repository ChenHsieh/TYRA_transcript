00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today is October 8th, 2022, Taira Talk.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The speaker we invited today is Ms. Zheng Huaijie.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The topic she will talk about is

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Jupiter Hub, a mini studio,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
an open science cloud base.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me briefly introduce Huaijie's background.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In 2010 and 2013, Huaijie obtained a master's and a master's degree in Taiwan University.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In 2015, she went to Cornell University

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for a PhD in Earth and Atmospheric Science.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In 2021, Huaijie joined a research team at the University of California, Berkeley.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She is now working as a post-PhD researcher

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
on the Jupiter-Meet-the-Earth project.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today, Huaijie will teach us about Jupiter Hub.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She also mentioned that you don't need any background knowledge or program design skills to participate in this talk.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
However, if you want to store Jupiter resources at the same time during the talk,

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you must prepare a Google or Microsoft account.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please prepare for the third part of the talk.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's all for my introduction.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's give the floor to Huaijie.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, Shi-An.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Thank you for your introduction.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's an honor to be able to invite Tara to give a talk.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My last talk was in January this year.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I would like to share with you what I am doing at UC Berkeley.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Instead of sharing, I would like to focus on Jupiter Hub.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I would like to share with you what Jupiter Hub is

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and why we call it the cloud base of open science.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How it can transform our practice of open science.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's get started.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I would like to share with you what I am doing at the moment.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I would like to add a little bit.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My field of expertise is earth science.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To be more precise, I am studying earth physics,

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
rock science,

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
meteorology,

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and astrophysics.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What I am doing at the moment is

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
using a lot of satellite data

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and model analysis

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to monitor and understand the changes in ice and snow.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For example,

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you can see a satellite here.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It orbits the earth

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and emits green light.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When it hits the ground,

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the satellite will receive the reflected light.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Based on the reflected light,

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we can calculate the distance between the satellite and the earth,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and convert it to the height of the earth.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If we can do this repeatedly for an ice cube,

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we can get an ice cube

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
with the time passing by,

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the height of the surface,

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
or the thickness of the ice.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then we use some physical models

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to analyze

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the factors

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that affect the thickness of the ice cube.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It sounds cool,

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and I like it.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
However, most of the academic activities

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that I am doing now

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
are similar to what you are doing.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We need to study

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and explain our research

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
to others,

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
including colleagues

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and people

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
in different fields.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In addition to research,

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
we also have teaching activities

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
where we write software

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
for others.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have done some of these.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Here are some pictures

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
of what I have done

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
in the past few years,

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
including developing a software

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
called KARS.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I also wrote a website

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
called GMT Tutorials.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In short,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I teach others

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
how to draw pictures

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
using GMT software.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The picture in the lower right corner

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is from a paper

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I published in 2019.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
At that time,

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I discussed with the paper publisher

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
how to make some materials

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that can be more efficient

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and faster

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to convey

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
some new knowledge

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
of the paper

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and make it

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
into a news article.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Back to our topic today,

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we are going to talk about JupyterHub.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How can we change

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the academic activities

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
we do every day?

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Before we talk about JupyterHub,

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
let's talk about

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the concept of Jupyter.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If I were to explain

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
what Jupyter is,

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I would say that

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Jupyter is an open

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
data science...

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sorry. Jupyter is an ecosystem

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
composed of open data science tools

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and a community

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
of open data scientists.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There might be some professional terminology here,

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
so I'll explain a little more.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The so-called tools here mean

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that if you want to complete

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
a task,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the tools you use...

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
For example,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Photoshop

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is a tool

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for video editing.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Matplotlib

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is a tool

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
used in Python

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
for scientific mapping.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Something like that.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
As for the word

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
open,

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
it's a little vague.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To be honest,

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
many different aspects

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
are considered to be open.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
For example,

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
it can refer to the tools you use.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The source code

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
may be public,

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and anyone can modify it.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
On the other hand,

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
the way you collaborate

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
allows as many people

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
as possible to participate

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and contribute and discuss.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Anyway,

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the core concept of

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the word open

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
is

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
not to be excluded,

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but to allow as many people

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
as possible to participate

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in what you are doing now.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So we have a lot of tools.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Some tools are software,

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
some tools are hardware,

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and some tools

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
are used to describe

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
how software and hardware

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
interact with each other.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
These tools are different

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
from other tools.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Think about it.

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you put a tool under a tool,

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
a screwdriver may be used to lock the screw,

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and a crowbar may be used

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to twist the wire.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
These tools are independent.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In data science,

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the so-called tools

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
often rely on each other.

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For example,

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
if you want to use Matplotlib today,

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you have to install Python first.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After installing Python,

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you can install Matplotlib,

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and it will work.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you draw the interdependence

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
between different tools,

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you will see a picture

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that looks like a network,

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
or a food chain.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So we tend to

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
call the interdependence

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
between tools

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and their interdependence

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
an ecosystem.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
An ecosystem like Jupyter

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is not very old.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The concept of open science

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
has only appeared

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
for about 20 years

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
so far.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You may feel shorter.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In the first ten years,

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
it was in the early stages.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not many people

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
were completely exposed

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to this concept.

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
One of the most likely

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
time to accept this exposure

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
is 2015.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
At that time,

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Lego released

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the first gravity wave observation

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
in human history.

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It shocked the world.

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They won the Nobel Prize

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
in 2017 or 2018.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Lego

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
did more than

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
this.

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Of course,

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
they are very good

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
at writing articles

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and building observatories.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But they also have

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
an open science department.

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This department

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
has compiled all the data

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
about the gravity wave observation

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and posted it on the Internet.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Everyone can

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
go to their website

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and click on their link.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You can re-execute the code

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and draw the same picture

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
as in their paper.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will share

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
my video later.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can click on the link

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to see what it is.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After 2015,

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
if you use Twitter,

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
you may see

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
more and more people

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
on Twitter

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
saying

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
how great the open science department is.

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It can make me do things

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I couldn't do before.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
For example,

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
this person used his phone

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to analyze the data

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
of CIMIP-6 on the train.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you don't know what CIMIP-6 is,

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
it is a global

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
climate simulation database.

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It generates

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
TBG data every day.

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The data

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is huge.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It is not easy

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to analyze the data

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
on the train

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
with a smart phone.

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's more,

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
NASA has announced

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
that

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
next year, 2023,

262
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
will be their open science year.

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They have a big project

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
called TOPS,

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Transform to Open Science.

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Starting from next year,

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it will take about 4 to 5 years.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They will

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
manage and

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
publish the data

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in a big way.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
After next year,

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
they will

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
adopt a new model,

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
a more open science model,

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to manage and publish

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
their data

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
work flow

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and research results.

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is a trend.

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We can see this trend.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Everyone is talking about it.

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Of course, thanks to the development of technology,

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
we now have

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
different ways

286
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to practice

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
open science.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Here is an example.

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We know that open science

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is a very common term.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are many

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
different ways to practice it.

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Here is an example.

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can see

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
these pictures.

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's say there is a researcher

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
named Jim.

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He just wrote a cool paper

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and published it.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He wants

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
more. He wants to say

302
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that he wants this paper

303
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to be

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
supported by

305
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
other people.

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He wants everyone

307
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to be able to

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
see his paper,

309
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
check for errors,

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and even

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
re-examine his experiment,

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and even

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
improve

314
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
his calculations

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in the paper.

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What can he do?

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Here is a method.

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He can use

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Jupyter Notebook.

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
In this file,

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
he can put all the details of the research,

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
including narrative text,

323
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
including city code,

324
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
including

325
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
many interactive

326
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
or non-interactive icons,

327
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
as well as more background resources,

328
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
such as primitive data,

329
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
multimedia,

330
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and software, etc.

331
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After he has

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
this Jupyter Notebook,

333
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
he can put it in a

334
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
network storage

335
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
so that everyone can read it.

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A more popular storage is

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
GitHub.

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He can put it on GitHub

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
so that everyone can see it.

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
After uploading,

341
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
he does more things

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to make

343
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this storage

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
called

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Finder Ready.

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Simply put,

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
he can provide additional information,

348
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
such as

349
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
what kind of software

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you need

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to run the notebook

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in this storage,

353
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
such as Python,

354
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
R,

355
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Julia, or Matlab.

356
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He can provide

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
background information

358
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and make a

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
set of files.

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He can arrange

361
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the files.

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When all these things are ready,

363
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
we can use

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
a tool called

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Docker

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
to

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
make this entire storage

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
into

369
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
an

370
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
independent

371
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
image.

372
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's like

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
a mini

374
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
execution environment.

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
In this environment,

376
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you can

377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
use the same environment

378
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to run these programs.

379
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now, all you have to do is

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
share this Docker image

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to other people around the world.

382
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Then other people

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
can perfectly reproduce your research

384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
without

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
additional installation of

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
many beautiful softwares.

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The above is

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
one of the examples

389
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
of open science.

390
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It allows people to

391
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
quickly save

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
their own research materials.

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How does JupyterHub

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
contribute

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to

396
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
data science process?

398
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If I were to

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
explain what JupyterHub is,

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I would say that

401
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
JupyterHub is a tool

402
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that provides

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
convenient data science environment

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
on a shared computer.

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What is a

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
shared computer?

407
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Simply put,

408
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
suppose you have

409
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
a computer in your lab,

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and everyone can log in

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and do something on it,

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
such as

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
writing articles, processing data,

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
writing papers, and so on.

415
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The server

416
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
you can log in to

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and store

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the CPU or GPU

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
resources in it

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
is called a shared computer.

421
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Traditionally,

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I guess some of you

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
may have used it,

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
such as SSH,

425
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to a remote server and do something on it.

426
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Of course,

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
you have to install a lot of things

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
in order to do

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
what you want to do on the server.

430
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
JupyterHub

431
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
eliminates these steps.

432
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It provides some pre-set

433
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
configurations

434
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
so that you can

435
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
go to the server

436
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
without doing anything

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and start

438
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
your data science analysis.

439
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Here is a picture

440
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of the concept

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of JupyterHub.

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can imagine

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
that there are a lot of people here.

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They are going to store

445
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
a machine like this.

446
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
JupyterHub is running on the machine.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Everyone has to pass a verification first.

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When they successfully

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
log in to the machine,

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
JupyterHub will provide

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
several standard interfaces

452
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
for them to choose from,

453
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
such as the Jupyter Notebook interface.

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Then they can start

455
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
storing the computing resources

456
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
in the machine

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
through this interface.

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Note that the computing resources

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
are separate from JupyterHub.

460
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
JupyterHub

461
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
can also prepare several

462
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
different computing environments.

463
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
For example, it can prepare

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
a Python environment.

465
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If I need it,

466
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can log in to JupyterHub

467
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and call the Python environment

468
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and say I want to use Python this time.

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
At the same time,

470
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
JupyterHub can also prepare

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
another environment

472
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that is completely built

473
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
on different tools.

474
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If others want to use it,

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
they can call it out at any time.

476
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So JupyterHub

477
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is a layer of disassembly

478
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
of such a work structure

479
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to make it easier

480
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
for open science and cooperation.

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Here is another example

482
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to explain

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
how JupyterHub

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
can achieve

485
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the goal we want,

486
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
that is, the goal of sharing the environment.

487
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let's say there is a professor

488
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
named John.

489
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He is now leading

490
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
a large-scale research project.

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This large-scale research project

492
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
has already

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
pre-configured

494
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the software he wants to use.

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
For example, he may want to use Python

496
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
for the first time.

497
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He says this is the environment I want.

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How does JupyterHub

499
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
tell others

500
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
to use this environment?

501
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We provide a method

502
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that allows JupyterHub

503
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to cooperate with

504
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the IT staff of the school.

505
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
JupyterHub will send

506
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
an application form

507
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
to the IT staff

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and say

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
this is the environment

510
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I want to design.

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the environment I want to provide.

512
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
These environments

513
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
will be configured

514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
in a configuration file

515
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
for the IT staff.

516
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
After receiving this file,

517
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
JupyterHub will

518
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
refer to the settings

519
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and open

520
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
a thing called Workspace Manager.

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
In this example,

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Workspace Manager is JupyterHub.

523
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I call it JupyterHub.

524
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The IT staff will open JupyterHub

525
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
in the computer of the school.

526
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
JupyterHub will read

527
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the file provided

528
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and configure

529
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the work environment

530
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
you need,

531
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
including Python,

532
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
etc.

533
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Finally,

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
JupyterHub will run

535
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
on the cloud server

536
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
of the school.

537
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
After it is configured,

538
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it will generate

539
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
a Docker file.

540
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's a bit like...

541
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If I talk too much

542
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and you don't understand,

543
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
please ask me later.

544
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It will generate a Docker file

545
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and

546
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a URL.

547
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
After

548
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
getting this URL,

549
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
you can send it

550
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to anyone

551
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
including students

552
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and their collaborators.

553
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They can connect to

554
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the JupyterHub login page.

555
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
As long as

556
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
they can verify their identity

557
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and log in,

558
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
they can save

559
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the JupyterHub

560
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
running on the cloud

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and all the

562
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
environment configuration

563
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
are ready.

564
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No need to install anything else.

565
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This is the concept of

566
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
sharing the environment.

567
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's all for the introduction.

568
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Since this is a mini workshop,

569
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
let's try

570
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
what JupyterHub is.

571
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The JupyterHub we want

572
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
is

573
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
a Kalisto

574
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
organization.

575
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Kalisto

576
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
has

577
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
two

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
non-profit organizations

579
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
in Canada.

580
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Their main goal

581
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
is to

582
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
provide

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
high school teachers

584
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in Canada

585
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
with sufficient resources

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to teach students

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
how to do

588
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
data science

589
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and

590
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
various teaching modules.

591
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Their

592
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
own JupyterHub is called

593
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
KalistoHub.

594
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
JupyterHub is the name

595
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
of the tool.

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The tool

597
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
is used to

598
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
connect the tool

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to the cloud.

600
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
KalistoHub

601
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
is the Kalisto

602
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
organization.

603
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They use JupyterHub

604
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to connect

605
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the Kalisto

606
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
organization

607
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to the cloud.

608
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is

609
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
my video link.

610
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is Kalisto's

611
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
website.

612
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I will continue to share my screen.

613
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Can you see that I am

614
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
on Kalisto's page?

615
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes.

616
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Can you hear me?

617
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

618
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Thank you.

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There is a KalistoHub

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
icon in the upper right corner.

621
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Click it.

622
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You will see

623
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that you can

624
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
log in.

625
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Log in with your account.

626
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It will ask you

627
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
if you want Google or Microsoft.

628
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You can choose what you want.

629
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I have Google.

630
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This is my

631
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Berkeley account.

632
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I will show you.

633
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
When you log in,

634
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
you will see this screen.

635
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You are preparing.

636
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, this is not what I want.

637
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let me do it again.

638
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I want to log in a new one.

639
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Log in.

640
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Log in with my Gmail.

641
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
OK.

642
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
After you log in,

643
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
you will see a page like this.

644
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This page is

645
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
one of the standard

646
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
interface of

647
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Kalisto.

648
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We usually call it

649
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Notebook interface.

650
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is everyone OK?

651
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Do you need to wait?

652
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I am OK.

653
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Is BlueJeans

654
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
available?

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Can you show me

656
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
if you need

657
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
more time?

658
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He can raise his hand.

659
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But I am not sure

660
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
what will happen.

661
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, OK.

662
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh, Weiwei.

663
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Let me pull out the chat window.

664
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now you can use the chat window

665
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
to let me know where you are.

666
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But I don't know how to pull it out.

667
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Anyway,

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
let's continue.

669
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
When you see this page,

670
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
it means you have successfully logged in

671
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
to Kalisto Hub.

672
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You have successfully logged in

673
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to Kalisto Hub,

674
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and you have started using

675
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
the computing resources provided by them.

676
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There will be a

677
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
file list here.

678
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You will see a file called

679
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Getting Started.

680
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You will see a page

681
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
like this.

682
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This is how

683
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Jupyter Notebook

684
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
looks like

685
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
under the Notebook interface.

686
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You can see that

687
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
this is a Notebook file.

688
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It looks very diverse,

689
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but if you click twice

690
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
on each block,

691
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
you will see their

692
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
original information.

693
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The original information

694
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is actually some words.

695
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
These words

696
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
are written in Markdown format.

697
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So when you are in editing mode,

698
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you can edit as you like.

699
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
For example,

700
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I can type blah blah

701
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
under this block.

702
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Then,

703
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
when you click Run,

704
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
it will re-

705
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
change this block to display mode.

706
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like this.

707
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You can see blah blah

708
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
under this block.

709
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
As I said,

710
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
this is a Jupyter Notebook,

711
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
so you can also

712
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
compute directly on it.

713
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
For example,

714
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
we can add some blocks

715
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
under this Notebook

716
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
by clicking Add.

717
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We can click

718
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
a block

719
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and type

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hello World.

721
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
In the upper right corner,

722
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you can see

723
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
what is the core

724
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
of this Notebook.

725
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Here it says

726
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Python 3,

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
which means that

728
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
when you click Run,

729
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Notebook will run

730
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
these programs

731
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
in Python.

732
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
For example,

733
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I can type

734
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
hello world

735
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and

736
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
print a.

737
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
After typing,

738
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
if you click Run,

739
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
it will run this program

740
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
in Python.

741
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If you want to add

742
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
more columns,

743
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you can also

744
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
change the block type

745
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
from Code

746
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
to Markdown.

747
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You can type here

748
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
like

749
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Today is

750
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Ira's speech.

751
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
After running,

752
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it will become

753
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the narrative text

754
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
in your Notebook.

755
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What I like

756
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
about Python Notebook

757
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
is the narrative text

758
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The Markdown

759
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
supports LaTeX,

760
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
so you can type

761
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
mathematical formulas here.

762
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
For example,

763
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I can type

764
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
what?

765
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Q

766
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
equals

767
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
OK

768
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
times

769
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
partial T

770
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
partial X

771
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This is a

772
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Parallelism.

773
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Then a Parallelism

774
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
will appear.

775
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you traditionally use LaTeX,

776
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it's hard to mix and match like this,

777
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
especially when

778
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
there is Chinese in your article.

779
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Traditionally,

780
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
LaTeX is very difficult to process

781
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Chinese content,

782
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but

783
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
in Jupyter Markdown,

784
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
because it

785
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
originally supports UTF,

786
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you can perfectly

787
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
mix these two things together.

788
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's very convenient.

789
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Is it OK so far?

790
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Should we pause or continue?

791
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm OK.

792
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Do you have any questions?

793
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Although there may be something to trouble you,

794
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I always look at the chat box,

795
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
so if there are any questions

796
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
in the chat,

797
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
can you interrupt me a little?

798
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
OK.

799
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Or if you see someone raising their hand,

800
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
you can interrupt me at any time.

801
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I will help you pay attention to these.

802
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You can continue.

803
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Thank you.

804
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We just talked about

805
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Jupyter Notebook and Core.

806
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
These two things are separate.

807
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Depending on the user's needs,

808
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
we can switch between different cores.

809
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So let's switch to a different core.

810
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's try not to use Python now.

811
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
If you move the mouse

812
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
to the menu above,

813
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
then select Kernel.

814
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then,

815
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
at the bottom of the Kernel,

816
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
there is a Change Kernel.

817
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You will see that

818
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
there are two cores in Callisto Hub.

819
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
One is Python, the other is R.

820
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let's try R.

821
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Now,

822
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
this Jupyter Notebook

823
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
is running R,

824
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
not Python.

825
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
If we re-run

826
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Hello World,

827
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
it will...

828
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, this part is still useful.

829
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Because there is also this part in R.

830
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But the syntax of R itself

831
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
is like this.

832
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This part of Python

833
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
cannot be executed.

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Something like this.

835
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Run.

836
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It will execute

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
this part of the program

838
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
in the way of R.

839
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
If you draw a picture on it,

840
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
for example,

841
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
let's quickly make an X.

842
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This is the program of R,

843
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
so if you don't understand,

844
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
you are welcome to ask me anytime.

845
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But now,

846
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I have to set five data points.

847
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then draw these five data points.

848
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then I can press

849
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Shift and Enter

850
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to run this program.

851
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Then it will call the jpg in R

852
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
to draw this thing.

853
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
For the jpg in Python,

854
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the jpg in Python

855
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
is also similar.

856
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Now,

857
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
we change the kernel

858
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
back to Python.

859
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Change.

860
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Then we bring it to the bottom.

861
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Let's try it.

862
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Use Python to draw.

863
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
In Python,

864
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
you have to enter some jpgs first.

865
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
For example,

866
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
here,

867
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I call

868
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
matplotlib and

869
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
numpy

870
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
to do things for me.

871
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Then,

872
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
roughly like this,

873
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you can draw a picture of Sine.

874
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You can see that these two pictures

875
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
look very different.

876
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
To some extent,

877
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
they are actually two different jpg sets.

878
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The one above is R.

879
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The one below is Python.

880
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Of course, if you want,

881
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
you can also save this picture.

882
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We can add one more command,

883
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and we call it

884
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
test.png.

885
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
After drawing,

886
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
after re-executing,

887
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
test.png

888
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
will appear in the file list.

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
If we go back to the file list,

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
File,

891
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
File, then Open,

892
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
you will go back to the file list screen.

893
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You will see that

894
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
a new file called test has appeared.

895
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Open it,

896
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
you can see this png file.

897
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You can also select it,

898
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and then download it.

899
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The download button is

900
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
here,

901
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
this part of the top row.

902
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You can download it to your own computer.

903
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The above is a simple

904
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
way to operate

905
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
the notebook interface.

906
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You can find that we are really using

907
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
JupyterHub,

908
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
the computing resources provided by Callisto

909
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
to help you do some scientific analysis.

910
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Of course, it also has

911
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
some traditional

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
4-in-1 operating modes.

913
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If you move the mouse

914
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to the New

915
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
on the list,

916
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
press it,

917
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you will see several options.

918
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You can open a new notebook.

919
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You can also open other types of files.

920
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There is a file here

921
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
called Terminal.

922
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
After pressing it,

923
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you can turn on

924
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
a traditional terminal,

925
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
and then operate

926
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
what you want to operate,

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
such as LOS or

928
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
PWD, etc.,

929
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
anything you want.

930
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What I want to show you here is

931
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the so-called installation settings.

932
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This command needs to wait,

933
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
because it uses

934
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Conda,

935
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a settings software,

936
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
to install the settings.

937
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's a software,

938
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and sometimes it takes a long time.

939
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But...

940
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It looks like there's still some time.

941
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But...

942
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, I'm out.

943
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You can see that

944
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it's already pre-installed.

945
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There are a lot of settings pre-installed,

946
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
including...

947
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
For example, in Python,

948
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
because I'm more familiar with Python,

949
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you can see that

950
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
there are

951
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Dask,

952
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
a set of parallel algorithms,

953
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and then, for example,

954
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
there's Geopandas,

955
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
a set of geospatial data,

956
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
and then, for example,

957
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
there's also

958
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
HDF5,

959
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a set of HDF files,

960
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
as well as

961
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
a variety of

962
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
other kinds of

963
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
settings.

964
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Of course, there's also Matplotlib here,

965
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and other different

966
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
visualizations, such as

967
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I think it should have Cborn installed.

968
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Cborn is

969
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
probably here.

970
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Scientific analysis is more common,

971
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
like SciPy,

972
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
or non-Python files.

973
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
As you can see,

974
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
if someone can help you

975
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
pre-install these settings,

976
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
then you don't have to

977
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
spend so much effort

978
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
to install the settings,

979
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and deal with the problems of

980
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
each other's reliance.

981
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Sometimes these problems

982
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
will greatly hinder

983
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
the progress of a research.

984
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So, is it still OK here?

985
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If it's still OK,

986
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we'll move on to the next stage.

987
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm OK.

988
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
OK, OK.

989
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OK, let's go back to

990
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the file list.

991
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
In this file list,

992
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
we just talked about

993
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Notebook Entry,

994
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
which is a traditional

995
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Github interface.

996
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I want to introduce

997
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a relatively new

998
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
interface called Lab.

999
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The way to save it is

1000
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to cut off the tree

1001
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
in the file list,

1002
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and change it to Lab.

1003
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then,

1004
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
enter it.

1005
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
When you do this,

1006
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
you will enter

1007
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
another interface

1008
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
called Lab.

1009
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
If you need

1010
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
some information,

1011
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
you can go back to our video.

1012
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There should be steps

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in the following videos.

1014
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The interface of Lab

1015
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
looks a little different

1016
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
from that of Notebook.

1017
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The biggest difference is

1018
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
that the interface of Lab

1019
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
consists of many different small panels.

1020
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
For example, the left panel

1021
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is for file browsing,

1022
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and the right panel

1023
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
is for test.png.

1024
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You can click twice

1025
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and the right panel

1026
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
will show the test.png.

1027
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Of course,

1028
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the Notebook is already open

1029
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and you can see the information

1030
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
is still there.

1031
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So they actually

1032
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
store the same server,

1033
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
but with different interfaces.

1034
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What can we do

1035
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
with the Notebook?

1036
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You can see

1037
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a blue plus sign in the upper left corner.

1038
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Click it

1039
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to open the start page.

1040
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
In the start page,

1041
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you can choose

1042
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
what kind of content you want to start.

1043
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You can start a notebook

1044
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
with Python as the core,

1045
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or with R as the core.

1046
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Or you can

1047
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
start a terminal

1048
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and do the same thing as before,

1049
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like start with S.

1050
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
As I said,

1051
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the best selling point of Lab

1052
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is that it has different panels

1053
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
for window browsing.

1054
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The advantage of doing this

1055
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
is that you can compare the two.

1056
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
For example,

1057
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
if you go back to the iPad and Notebook

1058
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and move to the bottom of the page,

1059
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and click the right button

1060
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
to see the list,

1061
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
you can see that there are a lot of lists.

1062
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
One of them is called

1063
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Create New View for Output.

1064
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Click it.

1065
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This picture will move to a new panel.

1066
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You can move it around.

1067
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It's like

1068
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
many powerful software

1069
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
these days.

1070
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You can compare it with different pictures.

1071
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
For example, I can re-draw one.

1072
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'll change it to Cosine.

1073
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Re-draw.

1074
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, this is also a comparison.

1075
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But I can change it.

1076
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Copy.

1077
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Do the same thing.

1078
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But here I want to make it Sine.

1079
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Re-draw.

1080
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Then you can compare this picture

1081
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
with this picture.

1082
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And so on.

1083
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
JupyterLab

1084
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
also supports a lot of other

1085
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
not only Notebook,

1086
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but also a lot of other file display modes.

1087
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
For example, if you click the PNG file,

1088
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it will jump out of the PNG file.

1089
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
If you click the CSV file,

1090
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
it can also display the CSV file

1091
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
in a display way.

1092
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And so on.

1093
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It also has

1094
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
some more gorgeous settings.

1095
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
For example,

1096
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
if you move to the

1097
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
list above,

1098
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
there is a list called

1099
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Settings.

1100
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The first one is Scene.

1101
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Here you can choose

1102
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
whether to use

1103
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
bright colors or dark colors.

1104
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The default is bright colors.

1105
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But I prefer dark colors.

1106
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So I'll change it to dark colors.

1107
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Let's see what happens.

1108
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's dark colors.

1109
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
In addition,

1110
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
you can do more customization.

1111
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
For example,

1112
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
if you open Settings,

1113
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
there is a Language.

1114
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But at the moment,

1115
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
there is only English language.

1116
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
But we can install Chinese language.

1117
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
For example,

1118
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
if we go to Terminal,

1119
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and use pip,

1120
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
to install...

1121
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What's the name of this package?

1122
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's called

1123
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
JupyterLab

1124
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Language Pack.

1125
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Chinese.

1126
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Taiwan.

1127
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Something like that.

1128
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Install.

1129
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Then it will start to install.

1130
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's right.

1131
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You are now installing

1132
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the package you want on

1133
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
a server called CallistoHub.

1134
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
After installation,

1135
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
you need to re-organize this lab.

1136
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Just click on Re-organize.

1137
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Then the whole lab will be re-organized.

1138
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So,

1139
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
if you go to Settings,

1140
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Language,

1141
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
you should see Chinese.

1142
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You can choose Chinese or Taiwanese.

1143
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Go in.

1144
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Then Reload.

1145
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The JupyterLab with Chinese version

1146
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
will appear.

1147
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Maybe it's not that perfect.

1148
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You can see some of them are not translated.

1149
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Because the JupyterLab

1150
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
translation project

1151
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
is still in progress.

1152
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They are all public projects.

1153
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So if you are interested in contributing,

1154
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you can ask me.

1155
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I can send you the link.

1156
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But you can also google

1157
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the translation project link.

1158
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So far, I don't know if you have any questions.

1159
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
OK.

1160
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't see any questions.

1161
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
That's great.

1162
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It seems that everyone is very

1163
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
into the situation.

1164
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I don't know.

1165
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Does everyone follow?

1166
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm following.

1167
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It doesn't matter.

1168
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
OK.

1169
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because if you want to repeat it later,

1170
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you can refer to my first video.

1171
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There should be some details in the video

1172
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
to explain how to do these things.

1173
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The last part,

1174
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I want to share with you

1175
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
some of the functions of Hub.

1176
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So if we go to

1177
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
the menu,

1178
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
File,

1179
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and then the second one,

1180
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
you should see the Hub control panel

1181
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
or Hub control panel.

1182
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If you don't know how to install Chinese,

1183
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it's called Hub control panel.

1184
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Click it.

1185
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
A control panel will pop up.

1186
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Wow, it's so bright.

1187
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
If you don't mind,

1188
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'll turn on a light.

1189
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because it's getting dark here.

1190
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'll be right back.

1191
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
OK.

1192
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
On this control panel,

1193
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
you should only see two options.

1194
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The first option is

1195
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
to stop

1196
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
the server just now.

1197
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Now,

1198
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
click it.

1199
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Let's try to click

1200
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
this dot.

1201
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Now the server has been stopped.

1202
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
If we go back to the previous page,

1203
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
you can see

1204
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the server is unavailable or unreachable.

1205
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Because the server has been stopped.

1206
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But we can restart it.

1207
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So,

1208
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
we can click here

1209
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
to restart.

1210
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Or we can go back to the previous page

1211
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and click Start My Server.

1212
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's up to you.

1213
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Let's restart it.

1214
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
OK.

1215
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's done.

1216
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The preset interface will be

1217
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the notebook interface.

1218
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But you can see

1219
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
the generated files are still there.

1220
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The test.png is still there.

1221
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
However,

1222
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
if you switch to the lab interface,

1223
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you may find something

1224
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
different.

1225
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Let's take a look.

1226
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
OK.

1227
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
If you click

1228
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
the menu,

1229
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you may find the Chinese file is gone.

1230
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Why?

1231
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Why is the file still there,

1232
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but

1233
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the Chinese file is gone?

1234
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Here,

1235
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'd like to use this observation

1236
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
to explain the full line

1237
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
of JupyterHub.

1238
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
If you are a JupyterHub

1239
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
administrator,

1240
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
you can set the files or structures

1241
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
in JupyterHub

1242
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
which parts can't be changed by the user,

1243
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and which parts can be changed by the user.

1244
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
However, when you finish this server,

1245
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
it will reset.

1246
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The file we installed just now

1247
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
has been reset.

1248
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
If you want to re-install JupyterHub,

1249
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you have to install it again.

1250
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
However,

1251
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the administrator can also decide

1252
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
which parts can be saved

1253
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
by the user forever.

1254
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
In other words,

1255
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
if you just generate the files

1256
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
in those places,

1257
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you can save these files.

1258
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Every time you restart JupyterHub,

1259
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
these files will not disappear.

1260
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
For example, the test.png

1261
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
will always be saved

1262
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
in this server.

1263
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
As far as I know,

1264
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
there is a time limit

1265
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
in Kalisto.

1266
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
If you don't log in

1267
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
for more than 10 days,

1268
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
your file will be deleted.

1269
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Every hub

1270
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
has its own rules.

1271
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
For more details,

1272
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you can refer to their settings.

1273
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
If we go back to the Control Panel,

1274
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
you will see a Token.

1275
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
In the upper left corner,

1276
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
there is a Token.

1277
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
If you click on it,

1278
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you can see some

1279
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
complicated things.

1280
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Most of the things here

1281
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
are used by the administrator.

1282
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
However, I want to talk about

1283
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
the things below.

1284
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
For example,

1285
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
if you click on the

1286
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
OAuth application,

1287
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
JupyterHub

1288
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
is compatible

1289
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
with OAuth.

1290
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
This means that

1291
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
according to the administrator's

1292
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
own ideas,

1293
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
they can use

1294
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
third-party account information

1295
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
to enter

1296
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
JupyterHub verification.

1297
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
For example,

1298
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Kalisto Hub

1299
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
uses your Google account

1300
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
or Microsoft account

1301
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to verify.

1302
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
However,

1303
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
JupyterHub

1304
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
in our team

1305
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
uses GitHub account

1306
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to do third-party verification.

1307
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The advantage of doing this is

1308
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that the administrator

1309
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
can save a lot of time

1310
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
in managing users and their accounts.

1311
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Because you are

1312
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
distributing this responsibility

1313
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
to third-party groups.

1314
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I personally think it's good

1315
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
because you can imagine

1316
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
that almost every researcher

1317
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
has Google

1318
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and GitHub.

1319
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If you can use these accounts

1320
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
to log in to GitHub,

1321
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
it is very convenient.

1322
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
OK.

1323
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's about it.

1324
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
In the same video,

1325
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I will also put

1326
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
some screenshots.

1327
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Let's take a look.

1328
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Notebook Entry,

1329
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Web Entry.

1330
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
If today

1331
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
JupyterHub is running on a large

1332
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Google cloud

1333
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
or Amazon cloud,

1334
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
it may provide

1335
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
an option

1336
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
when starting the server.

1337
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It may say

1338
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
how many CPUs do you need

1339
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
for this server?

1340
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You can choose

1341
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
to run a large server

1342
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
or a small server.

1343
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Kalisto is a free hub,

1344
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
so it provides

1345
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
all users

1346
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
with one CPU.

1347
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That is,

1348
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
you can only use one CPU

1349
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
to do things.

1350
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
This screenshot is

1351
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
taken from my research hub.

1352
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You can see that

1353
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
we can open up to 64 CPUs.

1354
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
In fact, there are 64 CPUs

1355
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
plus GPU options.

1356
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's more luxurious.

1357
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The other screenshot

1358
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
is only

1359
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
seen by the manager of the hub.

1360
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You can see

1361
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
some

1362
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
If you are a manager,

1363
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
you can see

1364
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
how many people are using this hub,

1365
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
who are using it,

1366
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and who haven't used it for a long time.

1367
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You can

1368
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
stop it.

1369
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
If you find any abnormal usage,

1370
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
you can turn off their hub.

1371
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Then they can't continue to use it.

1372
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Something like that.

1373
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Let's take a look at

1374
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
the manager's interface.

1375
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There is a problem here.

1376
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's almost an hour,

1377
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
so I want to stop

1378
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
to see if there are any questions.

1379
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I have a question.

1380
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
If Kalisto

1381
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
is a user,

1382
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
how should you use it?

1383
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Good question.

1384
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
If we go back to the hub,

1385
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
you can see

1386
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
in the Getting Started

1387
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
notebook, there are some links.

1388
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You can click on these links.

1389
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
For example,

1390
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
you can click on

1391
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Kalisto Jupyter and Python Basics Notebook

1392
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
in Preparation.

1393
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Then

1394
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
this hub will start

1395
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
retrieving the resources

1396
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
stored on GitHub.

1397
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Then copy a copy to the hub.

1398
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
After they are done,

1399
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
your hub space

1400
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
will have more resources.

1401
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
These resources

1402
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
are the resources you can use to learn.

1403
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's out.

1404
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This is the new notebook I just retrieved.

1405
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
This notebook teaches you

1406
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Python.

1407
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
There is a YouTube video

1408
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
here.

1409
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You can watch it.

1410
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
You can watch it like this.

1411
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
There are some other things

1412
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
at the bottom.

1413
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You can add text statements

1414
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and run these programs.

1415
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Let's see what happens next.

1416
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, there is a video.

1417
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'd like to watch it, but I'll watch it another day.

1418
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So it's like a teaching hub.

1419
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's a teaching hub.

1420
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There are various teaching websites.

1421
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yes, it's a teaching hub.

1422
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
If we go back to the

1423
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
previous lab interface,

1424
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
you can see

1425
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
if you click on Reorganize,

1426
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you can see

1427
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
a new folder.

1428
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
If you click on it,

1429
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
you can see a lot of things in it.

1430
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This is what you just downloaded.

1431
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
In addition to the previous notebook,

1432
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
there are many other notebooks

1433
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
that you can refer to.

1434
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
In short,

1435
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
it's a large-scale resource

1436
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
that is provided to

1437
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
elementary and junior high school teachers

1438
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
for their use of data science.

1439
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You can see

1440
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
what modules have been created.

1441
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
In addition to using this method to browse,

1442
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Calista also provides resources.

1443
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There should be another Calista Learning Module.

1444
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
If you click on it,

1445
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you will be connected to another page of Calista.

1446
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
There are a lot of learning modules at the bottom.

1447
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So if you are a teacher today,

1448
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
you can say,

1449
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
which module do you want your students to learn today?

1450
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Just click on it.

1451
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Then the content of the module will be directly

1452
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
retrieved to JupyterHub.

1453
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Or you can ask your students to click on it themselves.

1454
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Students can use their account

1455
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
to directly execute

1456
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
what's on it.

1457
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
There are many other resources here.

1458
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
One of my favorite resources

1459
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
is that they have

1460
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the content of

1461
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
cooperating with indigenous people in North America.

1462
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
For example,

1463
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
if you click on it,

1464
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
there is a trap.

1465
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You can use data analysis

1466
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
to see

1467
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
which side of the trap

1468
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
is the best for catching fish.

1469
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It is a learning module,

1470
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
so when you click on it,

1471
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
it will be retrieved to your hub.

1472
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Then you can start

1473
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
doing these interesting data analysis.

1474
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Oh, I'm done.

1475
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Okay, it's here.

1476
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Then you can see

1477
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
what's here. Let's try it.

1478
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Oh,

1479
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
there is a map.

1480
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
This is an interactive map.

1481
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You can drag and drop here.

1482
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
This is

1483
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
a fishing ground near Vancouver.

1484
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And so on.

1485
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So Callisto

1486
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
provides a lot of teaching resources

1487
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
to help you familiarize yourself

1488
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
with data science.

1489
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Of course, for you,

1490
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
there is JupyterHub.

1491
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It looks cool.

1492
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
These data

1493
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
are all

1494
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
going through

1495
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Callisto.

1496
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Is it an organization?

1497
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Do they need to be certified?

1498
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
How do you decide

1499
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
whether or not to upload these data?

1500
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Callisto is a kind of project.

1501
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It is a project of cooperation between two organizations.

1502
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Two

1503
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
non-profit organizations, NPO.

1504
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It is a cooperation project.

1505
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
These two organizations

1506
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
have a team

1507
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
to maintain Callisto.

1508
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
All the modules

1509
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
are written by them.

1510
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But the data they use

1511
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
should be from somewhere else.

1512
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
For example, the fishing data

1513
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
is from the local

1514
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
tribe.

1515
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Then it is imported.

1516
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
In addition,

1517
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
there are also a lot of public data on science.

1518
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
They should use those public data

1519
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
to show

1520
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
how data science works.

1521
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I see.

1522
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Thank you.

1523
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Actually, there is one last part.

1524
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
If you are satisfied,

1525
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
we can stop here.

1526
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's okay.

1527
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We can continue.

1528
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Really?

1529
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
If you

1530
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
think it's okay,

1531
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I will talk about the rest of the video.

1532
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The last part

1533
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
is

1534
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
to provide you with more resources.

1535
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
In addition to

1536
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Callisto Hub,

1537
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
there are many

1538
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
other Hubs.

1539
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
For example, a commonly used Hub service

1540
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
is Binder.

1541
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Binder

1542
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
is used to

1543
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
turn a GitHub

1544
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
storage into

1545
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a Hub that can be executed

1546
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
immediately.

1547
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
For example,

1548
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
this is an article I posted

1549
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
last year.

1550
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Its

1551
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
supplementary information

1552
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
is

1553
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
a

1554
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
GitHub page.

1555
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You can find a link

1556
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
on this GitHub page.

1557
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Let me see if I can

1558
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
switch to that page.

1559
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Oh,

1560
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
this GitHub page

1561
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
is the supplementary information

1562
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
of the article I just posted.

1563
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
There will be a link

1564
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
to Binder below.

1565
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
If you click on it,

1566
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
you can start something called Binder.

1567
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It will take you to a place

1568
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
similar to Jupyter

1569
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
on the GitHub page.

1570
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You can

1571
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
review the information

1572
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
in this article,

1573
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and then

1574
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
re-create

1575
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
each image in this article.

1576
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
There are

1577
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
many details to explain.

1578
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
This is Binder,

1579
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
another service provided by GitHub.

1580
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It looks like this.

1581
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This is

1582
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
related to earth science.

1583
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's called Pangeo Cloud.

1584
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It's kind of

1585
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
semi-public.

1586
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
As long as you are doing earth science,

1587
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
you can use their service.

1588
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
After registration

1589
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and review,

1590
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
you can start using their

1591
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
JupyterHub deployed on

1592
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Google Cloud and Amazon.

1593
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You can directly save

1594
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
cloud computing resources

1595
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
on JupyterHub.

1596
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's cool.

1597
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Of course, there is Callisto.

1598
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
We won't talk about it.

1599
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
If you think

1600
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Callisto Learning Module

1601
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
is a bit complicated,

1602
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
or you want a quick

1603
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
learning resource we recommend,

1604
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
there are two.

1605
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You can refer to them.

1606
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You can directly

1607
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
go to the hub

1608
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and enter the terminal,

1609
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
or you can enter any of them.

1610
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
You can enter any of them.

1611
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
These two are actually

1612
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
the storage on GitHub.

1613
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You can put all the

1614
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
content on the hub.

1615
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
For example,

1616
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
let's use League

1617
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
as a reference.

1618
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Copy and go back to the hub.

1619
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Open the terminal.

1620
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Paste it.

1621
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
After you paste it,

1622
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you can see

1623
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
a demo JupyterGit

1624
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
in the main folder.

1625
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
There are a lot of things

1626
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
when you click on it.

1627
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Let's take a look.

1628
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
There is an ip1v here.

1629
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is an iPython notebook

1630
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that can be executed.

1631
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Other notebooks should be

1632
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
in the folder,

1633
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
such as intro Jupyter.

1634
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You can see all kinds of

1635
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
introduction to Jupyter tools.

1636
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
In short,

1637
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
there are a lot of learning resources here.

1638
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You are welcome to

1639
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
try it out

1640
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
at any time.

1641
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
In the last two or three videos,

1642
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I want to briefly explain

1643
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
that if you really

1644
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
like JupyterHub,

1645
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and you want to

1646
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
install JupyterHub for your

1647
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
research team,

1648
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
what should you do?

1649
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
First of all,

1650
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
JupyterHub provides

1651
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
two standard versions.

1652
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
One is called The Littlest JupyterHub.

1653
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
This version

1654
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
is specifically for

1655
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
small teams,

1656
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
between 0 to 100 people.

1657
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
In short,

1658
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it is simplified.

1659
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
You don't have to spend

1660
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
a lot of effort.

1661
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You can install it on your

1662
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
lab server

1663
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
for your colleagues or students.

1664
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
The other version is

1665
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
JupyterHub on Kubernetes.

1666
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
This version

1667
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
is specifically for

1668
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
large cloud

1669
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
installations.

1670
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
For example,

1671
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
JupyterHub installation

1672
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
on Amazon

1673
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
or Microsoft Azure.

1674
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
This version is for

1675
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
hundreds or thousands of people,

1676
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
or JupyterHub installation

1677
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
on a supercomputer.

1678
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
If you want to install it,

1679
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
choose one

1680
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
that suits you.

1681
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Even so,

1682
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
you may still feel

1683
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
that the technical performance

1684
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
is too high.

1685
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
After all,

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
most people are not

1687
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
good at it.

1688
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Of course, we also see this difficulty.

1689
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
In 2019,

1690
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
some of us

1691
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
in the Jupyter team

1692
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
at Berkeley

1693
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
established a non-profit organization

1694
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
called 2I2C,

1695
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
or the International Interactive

1696
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Computing Collaboration.

1697
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The purpose of

1698
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
this non-profit organization

1699
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
is to provide

1700
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
various open science

1701
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
and technology services.

1702
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
One of the most

1703
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
developed services

1704
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
is to provide

1705
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
research teams or organizations

1706
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
to install and manage

1707
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
their JupyterHub.

1708
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Most of their

1709
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
funding comes from

1710
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
the John Zuckerberg

1711
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Initiative,

1712
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
the one on Facebook.

1713
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
However,

1714
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
they also receive

1715
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
funding from

1716
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
the International Interactive

1717
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Computing Collaboration.

1718
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
The Callisto

1719
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and Pangeo

1720
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
hubs we just saw

1721
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
were set up

1722
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
by 2I2C.

1723
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
However,

1724
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Binder and our own

1725
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
research hub are not.

1726
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Our own research hub

1727
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
is more gorgeous

1728
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
because we have to test

1729
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
a lot of things.

1730
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Our hub looks like this.

1731
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Let me show you.

1732
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It should be here.

1733
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I don't think I can start.

1734
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Looks like I have to wait.

1735
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'll come back later.

1736
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So,

1737
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
what we want to achieve

1738
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
through 2I2C

1739
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
is that

1740
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
one day in the future,

1741
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
as a researcher,

1742
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
all your research activities

1743
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and academic activities

1744
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
can take place on the cloud.

1745
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Your own research team

1746
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
will collaborate on the cloud.

1747
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You have to save

1748
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
HPC computing resources

1749
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and use JupyterHub

1750
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
to log in.

1751
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The school itself

1752
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
may have a JupyterHub.

1753
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
When you have a lecture

1754
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
or a lecture,

1755
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
you can use their hub

1756
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
to give others

1757
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
what you want

1758
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
them to learn.

1759
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Even if you attend

1760
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
an international conference,

1761
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
this conference

1762
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
may have a hub

1763
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
for the participants

1764
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
to log in

1765
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
and learn new skills

1766
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
through the hub.

1767
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
That's about it.

1768
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Finally, I want to say

1769
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
that all the progress of open science

1770
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
is not done by ourselves.

1771
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
There are many

1772
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
community members.

1773
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
For example,

1774
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
what I can share with you today

1775
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
is a tribute to

1776
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
our entire research team

1777
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
at Berkeley,

1778
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
JupyterMeteors.

1779
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I put all their people here

1780
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and let you know

1781
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
what the JupyterMeteors

1782
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
project is doing.

1783
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Thank you very much.

1784
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
If you have any questions,

1785
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
you can contact me

1786
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
by text message

1787
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
or via ZXL.

1788
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You can contact me anytime.

1789
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
This is my last video.

1790
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Thank you.

1791
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Thank you, Huaijie.

1792
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
If you are interested,

1793
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
you can turn on the microphone

1794
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and give Huaijie a round of applause.

1795
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Let me

1796
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
find the

1797
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
POAP code.

1798
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Let me find it.

1799
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
If you have any questions,

1800
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
you can ask now.

1801
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Thank you for your applause.

1802
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Thank you for your applause.

1803
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Let me write down

1804
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
the POAP code.

1805
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Thank you for your participation.

1806
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Thank you.

1807
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I have a question.

1808
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
For your first video,

1809
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
do you want to

1810
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
share it on

1811
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Tyra's website?

1812
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Otherwise,

1813
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
your sharing

1814
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
should be only temporary.

1815
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Let me think about it.

1816
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I can share it

1817
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
to the participants.

1818
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Absolutely no problem.

1819
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
This video will be released soon.

1820
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
But I don't know if I can share it on the website.

1821
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I will contact you later.

1822
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
No problem.

1823
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Also,

1824
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I have a question.

1825
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Many

1826
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
quantum computing

1827
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
companies

1828
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
do similar things,

1829
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
such as

1830
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
sharing their

1831
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
computing resources

1832
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
on the cloud.

1833
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Do you

1834
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
write the code

1835
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
on Python

1836
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and upload it to their server?

1837
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
They will run the code for you.

1838
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Their hardware is different,

1839
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
but they will run the code for you.

1840
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Actually, this is a more traditional way.

1841
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
A more traditional way

1842
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
to use a supercomputer

1843
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
is that there is

1844
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
something like a work processor.

1845
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You have to

1846
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
upload your

1847
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
code to the

1848
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
work processor.

1849
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The work processor

1850
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
will deploy

1851
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
and decide

1852
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
how many computing resources

1853
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
to run your code

1854
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
at what time.

1855
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Finally,

1856
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
the result will be packed

1857
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and sent to you.

1858
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
This is a more

1859
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
traditional way.

1860
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
The way we promote now is

1861
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
to save

1862
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
the part of the work processor.

1863
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
JupyterHub itself can be used as a work processor.

1864
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
As long as you use the right

1865
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
structure, such as Kubernetes,

1866
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
the actual

1867
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
technical details are a bit complicated.

1868
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I will make it simple.

1869
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
As long as you use

1870
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
the structure of Kubernetes,

1871
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
you can

1872
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
use JupyterHub

1873
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
as a scheduler.

1874
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
As a work processor,

1875
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
you can decide

1876
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
how many resources

1877
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
you want to use

1878
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
at the beginning of your script.

1879
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
You can use several nodes,

1880
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
several clusters,

1881
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and then you start running.

1882
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
JupyterHub

1883
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and Dask,

1884
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Dask is a suite of parallel algorithms

1885
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I just mentioned,

1886
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
with Dask's

1887
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
external components.

1888
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
As long as you use Dask,

1889
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
you can

1890
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
open a few

1891
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
control panels

1892
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
in JupyterHub

1893
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
to monitor

1894
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
how many CPUs

1895
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
you use

1896
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
when running

1897
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
these program codes

1898
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
in real time.

1899
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
If you have questions,

1900
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
you can ask me

1901
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
in the chat room.

1902
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Thanks for watching.

1903
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It seems that

1904
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
the gun has disappeared.

1905
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
It's okay. Let's wait for it.

1906
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
If you have questions,

1907
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
you can ask me

1908
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
in the chat room.

1909
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
If you have questions,

1910
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
you can ask me

1911
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
in the chat room.

1912
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Thanks for watching.

1913
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Thanks for watching.

1914
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Thanks for watching.

1915
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
武藤阿輝是甚麼意思
