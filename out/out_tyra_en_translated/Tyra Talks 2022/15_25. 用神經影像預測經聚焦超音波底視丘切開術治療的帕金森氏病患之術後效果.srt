00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
TARA is an organization for young researchers in Taiwan.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have a TARA Talk every week on the weekends.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The format and content of this talk are very diverse.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Academic researchers can come here to share their research results,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
practice giving presentations,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or get to know potential future collaborators.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Next week and the following week,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we will have a presentation on quantum physics and machine learning.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you are interested, you can sign up for our presentation announcement.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000

or use the link in the chat.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We have a special Slack channel for TARA members.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We will share various activities, work opportunities,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or new information in the relevant fields.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You are very welcome to join us.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In today's event, we will also issue a TARA badge.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is the NFT blockchain.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The TARA badge looks pretty good.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will put the relevant information in the chat later.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can take a look at it.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At the end of the presentation, we will announce the receipt of the badge.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It requires a password.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We will announce it at the end of the presentation.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If your phone cannot install the POAP app we use,

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you can leave it after the presentation.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We will discuss how to solve it.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's get back to the topic.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Today's speaker is Lin Shujing.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shujing completed her university and master's degree in Taiwan.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She studied medical imaging and brain science

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
at Zhongshan Medical School and Yangming University.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
During her university days,

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
she trained as a clinical radiologist.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
During her master's degree,

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
she studied fMRI analysis in the brain function group of Dr. Long.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
During her master's degree,

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
she studied neuroscience at UBC University in Canada.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
During her master's degree,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
she studied the connection between functional neuroimaging

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and the cognitive functions of neuropaths.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She focused on neural network analysis.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Currently, she is a research fellow

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
at Montreal Neurological Institute in Canada.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She is on a business trip in Germany.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Based on Chaira's tradition,

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
please turn on your microphone

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and welcome the speaker.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you ready?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
3, 2, 1.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I will stop sharing the screen.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The stage is yours, Shujing.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hi, everyone.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm at the hotel in Munihae.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I hope the internet connection is stable.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I hope there won't be any problems.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If there are any problems,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will try again later.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please bear with me if there are any problems.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Today, I'm going to talk about

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
neuroimaging.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is neuroimaging?

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is neuroimaging?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is neuroimaging?

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What I'm going to talk about today

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is a paper in MNI.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This paper was accepted

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
last year.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will mainly talk about the main points.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will also talk about some details.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I will put the reference in the end.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can read it if you are interested.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Or we can discuss it later.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My title is a bit long.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Neuroimaging can predict

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the effect of a patient's treatment.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's take a look at the topic.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a bit slow.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
First, I will talk about

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the general background information.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is not related to

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
what I'm going to talk about today.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's mainly for the general concept.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The main point is

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
what I'm going to talk about today

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is an application.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's an application using multivariant.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why do we use multivariant

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
instead of univariant?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Univariant is a more traditional method.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It can indeed increase your statistical efficiency.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But it's too simple.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can't know much about it.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are many new evidences.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There are many different diseases.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Neuroimaging, neuroinflammatory,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and other diseases

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
are not caused by a single factor.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you use univariant,

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you can't see the other important details.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The advantage of using multivariant

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
is that you can see the multidimensional association.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can find a comprehensive effect

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
instead of a single number or variable.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In this way, you can know more precisely

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the relationship between your data and clinical trials.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The research I'm going to talk about

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
is mainly used in Parkinson's disease.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a clinical trial.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The main purpose is

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to see if the baseline data

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
can predict the improvement

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
after the treatment.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is our central idea.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Next, I'm going to talk about

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the research I'm going to talk about.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
First, I'm going to talk about

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
neuropsychology.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is Parkinson's disease?

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a disease related to action.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The main cause is

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a neuroendocrine in the brain.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For some reason,

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we can't tell you what the reason is.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For some reason,

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the neuroendocrine gradually dies.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
On the right,

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in the normal human brain,

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
this place is called the substantia nigra.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
There are many black cells,

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
the so-called dopamine neurons.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But in the patient,

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the black cells are gone.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They become white.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
These cells are dead.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They can't transfer the neuroendocrine

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to other areas of the brain.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This will cause many clinical symptoms,

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
including exercise and non-exercise symptoms.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The so-called exercise symptoms

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we often hear is resting tremor.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If the patient is sitting,

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
his hands will keep shaking.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Or non-exercise symptoms,

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
such as cognitive impairment,

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
or some patients have insomnia, etc.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because it's not just a professional exercise symptom,

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we say that

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
every patient is a little different.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we say it's heterogeneous.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Everyone is different.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not just the so-called dopamine system that's affected.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Other neuroendocrine systems are also affected.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So we think this is also a so-called multifactorial disease.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's not just a single factor that affects this disease.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The current treatment includes

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the first and most common,

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
which is drug control.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Usually, this drug control

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is quite good for most patients.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But for some, I don't know why,

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
they don't react well to this drug.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If this is the case,

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
we can consider another way,

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
called deep brain stimulation.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Deep brain stimulation is actually very invasive.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But for some patients,

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it's a very effective treatment.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But it has one drawback,

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
which is that it's very invasive.

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Neuroendocrine is actually buried in the brain.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This electrode connects to a battery.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The battery is placed in the patient's chest.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
About every five years,

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the battery in the chest needs to be replaced.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But it's very invasive.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Not every patient can do this kind of surgery.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So far, we have another way,

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
which is the one I'm going to talk about today.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know what to do with it.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because we usually call it

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
hard-focus ultrasound.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This method uses

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
precise positioning with the help of imaging

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to see which area of the brain

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
needs to be stimulated.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The hard-focus ultrasound

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is a similar way of surgery

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to damage the brain tissue.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This will cause the brain to

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
change the connection of the brain circuit.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
After the change,

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it can improve some problems in the movement.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I saw the news a few weeks ago.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There is news like this in Taiwan.

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It seems to be about MRI navigation

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to teach ultrasound therapy.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It sounds terrible.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will talk about the hard-focus ultrasound.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's easier.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But the problem is,

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
although this method

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
can work well for many patients,

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
not everyone

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
can get the same result.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is what we are still wondering about.

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why?

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So we might think

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it's because we need some predictions

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
before the treatment.

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And these predictions

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
are not for the whole group,

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but for each patient.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So we need to predict the result

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to see if the patient

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is suitable for the treatment.

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Another important question is

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we need to understand

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
what is the actual effect

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
of the ultrasound.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Although the treatment

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
is very effective so far,

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
we are still not 100% sure

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
how it works.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So this is also an important question.

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Next,

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
let's talk about the main purpose of this research.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is a simple way

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to show

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
what we are doing.

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm not sure

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if I have a laser pointer.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me see.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay,

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have a laser pointer.

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There are two main ways.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The first one

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
is to see

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
if we can use

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the pre-treatment data

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
to predict the post-treatment results.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The second one

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is to see

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
if the clinical results

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
after the treatment

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
can be explained

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
by the pre-treatment results.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can the clinical results

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
be explained

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
by the pre-treatment results?

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We mainly use

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
multimodal neural imaging

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and clinical data

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to see

260
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
if we can achieve

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the two goals.

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let me briefly introduce

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
our patients.

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There are only

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
35 patients

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
with Parkinson's disease.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
These patients are monoclonal.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They are more affected.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Originally,

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we planned to receive

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
at least 50 patients.

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
However,

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
this clinical trial

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
was conducted in Spain,

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which is our partner.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
However,

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
COVID-19 happened

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
halfway through

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the clinical trial.

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The Spanish side

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
seemed to be slightly interrupted.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Several patients

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
were unable to

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
enter the clinic.

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
These patients

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
are monoclonal.

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They are treated

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with focus ultrasound.

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
After the treatment,

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
after 24 hours,

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
MRI imaging is performed

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to see

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
if the focus ultrasound

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
reaches the desired level.

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The white arrow

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
is the so-called lesion.

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It is the effect

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
of the focus ultrasound.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the so-called

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
subthalamic nucleon.

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I did not see

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the whole process.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
However,

304
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
according to my lab boss,

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the whole process

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
took a long time.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let me take a sip of water.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The patient

309
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
was treated

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
with focus ultrasound.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
After positioning,

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the focus ultrasound

313
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
reached the brain area.

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
At the same time,

315
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
neurosurgeons

316
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
continued to

317
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
perform ultrasound

318
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
to see

319
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
if the patient's symptoms

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
had improved immediately.

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
At the same time,

322
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
neurosurgeons

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
checked the temperature

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and the condition of the patient.

325
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
According to the patient's

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
immediate response,

327
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if the patient's symptoms

328
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
had improved,

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
they would stop the ultrasound.

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The whole process

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
took about 1-2 hours.

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
On the right,

333
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
we can see

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the difference

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
between the two

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
types of motor symptoms.

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
These are the motor symptoms

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
assessed by neurosurgeons.

339
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can see

340
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
these four types

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
of motor symptoms.

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They all improved

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
very well.

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
From baseline

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
our baseline,

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the patient

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
was treated.

349
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Three months later,

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the patient was treated.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is the fourth month.

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can see that

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
their treatment was very good.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The performance of the ultrasound

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
is good.

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
As for the actual method,

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
let's take a look at it

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
because there are too many details.

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
In short,

360
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
we use structural imaging

361
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and functional imaging.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Structural imaging

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
refers to TY-weighted MRI imaging.

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The first step is to

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
perform the imaging.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The imaging process

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
involves a lot of processing.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In the end,

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
what we need

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
are some numbers.

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In functional imaging,

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we need these two numbers,

373
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
F-alph and Re-alph.

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
F-alph refers to

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the low fluctuation

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in the racing set.

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a bit like

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the quantum number.

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Re-alph refers to

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the regional homogeneity.

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It refers to how similar

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
the regions of the brain are.

383
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In structural imaging,

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
what we need are

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the gravimetric density and

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the gravimetric atrophy,

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
which refers to

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
how much

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the patient's

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
brain shrinkage

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
has shrunk.

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
These are the four

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
different numbers,

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and we put them

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
into our analysis.

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is our

397
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
multimodal neural imaging phenotype.

398
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In statistical analysis,

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we use

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
multivariate cross-correlation,

401
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
which is the same

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
as POS,

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
partial least square.

404
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
In this way,

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
we can see

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
the relationship

407
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
between two different data.

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
In this experiment,

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the two different data

410
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
refer to images,

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
which are the features

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
of the brain.

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The other data

414
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
refers to how much

415
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the patients have improved.

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a simple graph.

417
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you're not familiar with

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
POS,

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
this is a simple graph

420
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
of X and Y.

421
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The purpose of POS

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
is to find the

423
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
X times A1.

424
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
A1 refers to

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
the weighting of X.

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We find the

427
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
X1 times A1

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
plus X2 times A2,

429
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and so on.

430
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
We find the linear combination

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and the linear combination of Y.

432
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
These two combinations

433
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
are closely related to each other.

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They are maximally co-variated.

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In this way,

436
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
POS will think

437
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that this is the pattern

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that we observe.

439
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is the relationship

440
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
between the two features.

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In addition,

442
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
we will do a lot of

443
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
statistical methods

444
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to determine

445
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
what we observe

446
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is meaningful in statistics,

447
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
including permutations and boosts.

448
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The purpose of boosts

449
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
is to see

450
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
which variables

451
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
are important

452
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and which are not.

453
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
These variables

454
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
are brain areas

455
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
or clinical data.

456
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We need to see

457
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
which variables

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
are important

459
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and which are not.

460
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This is another graph.

461
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's a bit like

462
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
a simple

463
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
progress bar.

464
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In this progress bar,

465
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
we have FMI and T1,

466
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
which are functional and structural data.

467
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
In terms of clinical data,

468
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
we calculate

469
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
how much

470
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the baseline and month for

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
have increased or improved.

472
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The first analysis

473
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
is to use

474
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
two sets of variables.

475
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The first set

476
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is imaging

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and the second set is clinical improvement.

478
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
In the process,

479
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
we will also put

480
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
covariables,

481
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
such as age, gender,

482
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and how long the patient has been sick.

483
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We will remove

484
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
these covariables

485
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
in a linear way,

486
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
so that we don't have to

487
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
worry about these factors

488
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
when we look at the results.

489
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The second analysis

490
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is to see the difference

491
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
between baseline and month for,

492
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
not just baseline or month for.

493
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's to see the difference between them.

494
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The other set of data

495
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
is clinical improvement.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We also put

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
some covariables in here.

498
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Next,

499
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
we will look at the results.

500
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The main results

501
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
are shown on the right.

502
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The main result

503
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
is to see

504
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
the X-weighting

505
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and Y-weighting.

506
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The bigger the X-weighting,

507
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the more important

508
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the Y-weighting is

509
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to the patient.

510
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If we look back at the results,

511
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
these bars

512
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
are the weightings

513
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
we just saw.

514
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is the simplest way

515
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
to show

516
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the results.

517
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This is the clinical data,

518
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and this is the imaging data.

519
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How do we interpret this?

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You have to look at the bars.

521
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If they are

522
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
all positive,

523
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
you can see

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
that the bars

525
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
are positive.

526
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The bars are positive.

527
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If the bars

528
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
on the positive side

529
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
are on the negative side,

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the bars on the negative side

531
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
are on the positive side.

532
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The bars on the positive side

533
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
are more.

534
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The bars on the negative side

535
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are increasing.

536
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The bars on the negative side

537
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
are decreasing.

538
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Of course,

539
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
we don't put this on paper

540
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
when we write paper

541
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to make it more beautiful.

542
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This is another picture.

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In addition to the

544
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
positive and negative

545
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
bars,

546
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the left upper corner

547
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
also tells you

548
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
how much

549
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the image

550
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is related to

551
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
clinical data.

552
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In short,

553
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
about 82%

554
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
of the data

555
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
can be interpreted.

556
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This is quite high.

557
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It means that

558
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
what we see

559
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
can represent our data.

560
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
When we do

561
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
permutation,

562
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
this is the result of permutation.

563
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It also means that

564
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it is related to statistics.

565
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
These are the improvements.

566
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There are comprehensive

567
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
motor improvements,

568
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
or rigidity,

569
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
or tremor,

570
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
which are specialized improvements.

571
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In short,

572
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
these improvements are related to

573
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
imaging.

574
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
These two pictures

575
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
are structural.

576
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They include

577
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
small brain,

578
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
superior parietal lobe,

579
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
or deep brain.

580
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This is grammatical density.

581
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It is also seen in

582
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
superior parietal lobe,

583
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
pecuniary parietal lobe,

584
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and small brain.

585
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So,

586
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
what we see after

587
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
clinical treatment

588
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
is that

589
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
these improvements

590
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
are related to

591
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
these brain areas,

592
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
not just single brain areas.

593
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The second result

594
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
is that

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
we use the difference

596
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
between baseline

597
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and month 4

598
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
as our

599
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
imaging data.

600
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The same is true

601
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
for the two groups

602
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
of the same image.

603
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The two images

604
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
are related to each other.

605
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We draw the same picture

606
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
in this way.

607
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We see that

608
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
90% of the data

609
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
is explained

610
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
in this way.

611
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is also quite high.

612
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We also see that

613
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
these clinical improvements

614
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
are related to many brain areas.

615
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In terms of functional brain areas,

616
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we also see some

617
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
in frontal lobe,

618
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
paracentral,

619
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
precuneus,

620
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
hippocampus,

621
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and temporal lobe.

622
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In terms of functional

623
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
brain areas,

624
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
we also see many

625
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
brain areas,

626
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
including small brain,

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
C-section,

628
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and even in

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
precuneus.

630
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We can also say that

631
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
the effect of this treatment

632
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
is not limited to single brain areas,

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but many different brain areas.

634
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
In particular,

635
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
there are many small brain areas.

636
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
At the beginning,

637
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
we were surprised

638
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that there are so many

639
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
small brain areas.

640
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Later on,

641
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
we found a way

642
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to explain it.

643
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Later on,

644
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we found a way

645
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
to explain it.

646
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
First of all,

647
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
we can use baseline

648
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to predict the effect

649
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
after the treatment.

650
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
In other words,

651
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
when the patient's

652
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
post-treatment effect is greater,

653
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the number of brain areas

654
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
will be relatively higher.

655
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
In other words,

656
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
patients with

657
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
strong treatment effect

658
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
may show

659
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
more atrophy.

660
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
may show more atrophy.

661
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
In other words,

662
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
the patient's brain

663
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
shrink more,

664
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and less gravitational

665
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
density.

666
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
In other words,

667
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the patient's brain

668
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
shrink more,

669
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and less gravitational

670
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
density.

671
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
In addition,

672
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the patient's brain

673
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
is not in single-brain area,

674
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but in many different areas.

675
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
In conclusion,

676
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
if the patient's

677
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
MRI

678
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
shows

679
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
severe atrophy,

680
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the treatment

681
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
may be better.

682
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In other words,

683
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
ultrasound treatment

684
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
can be used on severe patients.

685
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The second part

686
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
is the difference

687
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
between the baseline

688
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and the pre-treatment patients

689
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
As we can see in this way,

690
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
many posterior brain areas

691
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
appear on the MRI.

692
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This yes

693
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
depends on the function

694
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and the structure of patients.

695
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This depends on the function

696
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and the structure of patients.

697
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
These posterior brains

698
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
although the patient's

699
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
target is in the subthalamus

700
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
although the patient's target is in the subthalamus

701
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
in that brain area,

702
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
the effect of the treatment

703
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
is spread out in that area

704
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to the frontal,

705
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
to the parietal,

706
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and to the cerebellum.

707
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
There is an important link

708
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
from the midbrain

709
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
from the midbrain

710
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
to the cerebellum.

711
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
to the cerebellum.

712
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
to the cerebellum.

713
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There is a long white line

714
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
in the middle.

715
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There is a long white line

716
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
in the middle.

717
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The brain connects

718
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the brain areas.

719
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The effect of the treatment

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
is spread out from the midbrain

721
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
is spread out from the midbrain

722
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
like a telephone line,

723
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to the parietal.

724
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to the parietal.

725
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
to the parietal.

726
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain

727
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
to the head

728
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
to the brain

729
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
to the brain

730
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's not that the treatment spreads from the brain

731
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to the head

732
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,080
so we can see a significant change

733
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,000
in the brain

734
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
so we can see a significant change

735
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and the brain becomes an important indicator.

736
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We done this a year

737
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and I'd like to know

738
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
which type of patient

739
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we should focus on

740
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but

741
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
how can we do more?

742
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
how can we do more?

743
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I mean

744
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
how can we

745
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
push the current

746
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Parkinson's treatment

747
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to a single patient

748
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to a single patient

749
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I mean how can we

750
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
push the current treatment

751
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
to a personalized level

752
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
There are many ways we can do

753
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
not just group-wise

754
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
not just group-wise

755
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
say, he is sick

756
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
then we can do that

757
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and if he is not

758
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
then we can do another way

759
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or if he is this type of patient

760
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
then we can do that

761
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
because there are many patients

762
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
who can't do it

763
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
who can't do it

764
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so we need to

765
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
design the treatment

766
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
for those patients

767
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
another thing we can do is

768
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
before clinical trial

769
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
before clinical trial

770
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
we carefully select the patient

771
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
some patients are suitable

772
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
some patients are not

773
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
this is also a way

774
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
or we can build a lot

775
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
in a mathematical or engineering way

776
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to build the so-called brand model

777
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
to use these models to predict

778
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
the after-effects

779
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we can also do

780
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the so-called disease subtyping

781
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
that is, patients are not all the same

782
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
there may be many different subtypes

783
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and different subtypes

784
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
may be suitable for different treatments

785
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and so on

786
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so

787
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
let me talk about business

788
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
our lab

789
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
is currently doing the so-called

790
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
precision medicine

791
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
especially in neuroendocrine

792
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
the lab also developed

793
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a NeuroPM Bot

794
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
its purpose is to let you do

795
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
a lot of different analysis

796
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
this is the main

797
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
a little bit like you

798
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
open this toolbox

799
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and see what it looks like

800
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
our toolbox can actually

801
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
use a lot of different data

802
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
not just the image

803
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
in addition to the image

804
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
of course you can also

805
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
use clinical data

806
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
cognitive function detection

807
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
or blood or gene

808
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and so on

809
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
this interface

810
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
our toolbox

811
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
can be used for visualization

812
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it can see which brainstem

813
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
is important

814
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and then

815
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
this is a flowchart in paper

816
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
see what you need today

817
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
if you want to do

818
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
disease subtyping today

819
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
you can use this module

820
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
this is called CTI

821
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
if you want to do other parts

822
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
you can go here

823
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
if you have multi-modal imaging

824
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
you can do other things

825
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
if you only have a single image

826
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
there are so many kinds

827
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you can use ESM

828
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
ESM is mainly

829
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
look at where the disease

830
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
starts in your brain

831
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to find the source of the disease

832
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
the other one is to see

833
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the relationship between different modalities

834
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
or

835
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
on this side

836
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the so-called fingerprint

837
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
you can see

838
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
if you want to

839
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
visualize a patient

840
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
how much effort

841
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
does it take

842
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
to restore a patient's brain

843
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
this kind of information

844
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is more effective

845
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
in developing design

846
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I personally

847
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
have more experience

848
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
in this part

849
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
other people in our lab

850
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
have more experience

851
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
this is my lab code

852
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you can download it

853
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
on the lab website

854
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
CTI is mainly

855
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
disease subtyping

856
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and disease staging

857
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
if you have a lot of patients

858
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
let's say

859
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Parkinson's disease

860
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
we can find

861
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
these three

862
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
if there are three different

863
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
we can find these three

864
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
at the same time

865
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
we can see

866
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
if this patient is

867
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the most like a normal person

868
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
he is not so sick

869
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
so the color is light

870
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
or he is already

871
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
very serious

872
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that is more red

873
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
so we call it

874
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
pseudotype

875
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
if you use imaging

876
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
how serious is the disease

877
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
we call

878
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
estimated disease severity

879
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
this is the result

880
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
in the paper

881
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
let's say there are a lot of normal people

882
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Alzheimer's disease

883
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and Huntington's disease

884
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
we use CTI to

885
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
classify them

886
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
they have their own

887
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
trajectory

888
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Alzheimer's disease

889
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
their estimated disease severity

890
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
which is pseudotype

891
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
is very similar to

892
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
clinical indicators

893
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and Huntington's disease

894
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
is related to their disease stage

895
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
so we get these pseudotypes

896
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
actually it is quite meaningful

897
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
finally

898
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
this should be the last

899
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
sharing time

900
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
we are currently preparing a

901
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
workshop

902
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the time will be in spring or summer

903
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
we haven't decided

904
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the location will be at Montreal Neurological Institute

905
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
if you are interested in

906
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
coming to Montreal, you can try it

907
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
there will be two days

908
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the first day will be

909
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I-GET-TALK

910
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
there will be students

911
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
or postdoc session

912
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
the second day will be

913
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
hands-on workshop

914
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
we will introduce

915
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
how to use NeuroPM toolbox

916
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
or other precision medicine

917
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
toolbox

918
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
we will ask people to

919
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
introduce to you

920
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
we haven't decided

921
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
the time or the content

922
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
but if there is any news

923
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
we will put it on the lab website

924
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
roughly

925
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
this is

926
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
what we are going to talk about

927
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the paper on

928
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
focus ultrasound treatment

929
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
if you are interested

930
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
you can read it

931
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I have saved a lot of details

932
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
this is the paper on

933
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
toolbox

934
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
there is a manual

935
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
this is the funding agency

936
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
thank you

937
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
any questions?

938
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
thank you

939
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
someone

940
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
want to ask a question

941
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
yes

942
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
me

943
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
ok

944
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
hello

945
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I am Charlene

946
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I want to ask

947
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
when you use ultrasound

948
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to treat your brain

949
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
will the

950
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
dopamine

951
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
in your brain

952
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
recover?

953
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
frankly

954
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
no

955
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
we have

956
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
clinical trial

957
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
for a long time

958
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I haven't seen

959
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the latest data

960
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
but

961
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
according to clinical trial

962
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I can tell you

963
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
there is no such thing

964
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but the purpose of ultrasound

965
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
is to

966
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
cut off

967
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
the brain

968
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and make a lesion

969
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the whole

970
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
dopamine

971
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
recovery

972
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
the whole loop

973
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
will be cut off

974
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
it will

975
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
improve

976
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the whole process of

977
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
dopamine transmission

978
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
in theory

979
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
we can't see

980
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the regeneration of dopamine

981
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but we can

982
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
change the way

983
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
dopamine is transmitted

984
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
in the brain

985
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
in a physical way

986
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
ok

987
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
thank you

988
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
thank you

989
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want to ask

990
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the time and strength of

991
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
ultrasound

992
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
should be considered

993
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
yes

994
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
that's right

995
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I haven't been to

996
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Spain

997
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
to see their actual operation

998
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
but I know

999
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
neurosurgeons are

1000
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
well-prepared

1001
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
to keep positioning

1002
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and test other

1003
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
well-known data

1004
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
indeed

1005
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the strength

1006
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
must be strictly monitored

1007
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
the treatment time

1008
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
depends on the patient

1009
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
so

1010
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
from the beginning to the end

1011
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the strength and time

1012
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
depends on the patient

1013
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
they will move their hands

1014
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
like this

1015
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to see if the motor

1016
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
has improved

1017
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
if they find

1018
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the motor has improved

1019
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
they can stop

1020
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the ultrasound

1021
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I've seen

1022
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
other papers

1023
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
like

1024
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
to see if the data

1025
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
for example

1026
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the temperature of

1027
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
the brain

1028
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
will rise

1029
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
to what degree

1030
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is safe

1031
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
how strong

1032
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and so on

1033
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
if

1034
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
we want to

1035
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
apply the results

1036
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
to the clinical trial

1037
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
we will discuss with

1038
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
neurosurgeons

1039
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
to see if

1040
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
we can

1041
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
apply the results

1042
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to the clinical trial

1043
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
we do have

1044
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
a plan like this

1045
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but we haven't started

1046
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
yet

1047
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Thank you

1048
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I also have a question

1049
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
outside the door

1050
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
you mentioned

1051
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
a lot of treatment

1052
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm wondering

1053
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
if quantified

1054
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
has side effects

1055
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
yes

1056
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
usually

1057
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
after the treatment

1058
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
within 24 hours

1059
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
they scan the MRI

1060
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
to see the lesion

1061
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
the picture I showed

1062
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
in the slide

1063
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and also to see

1064
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
if there are any other

1065
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
complications

1066
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
in the brain

1067
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
after 24 hours

1068
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the patient will come back

1069
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
for follow-up

1070
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
they will

1071
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
based on the clinical trial

1072
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
called UBDRS

1073
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
to assess

1074
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
the whole process

1075
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to see if it is good

1076
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and other

1077
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
quality of life

1078
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
to see if there are

1079
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
other complications

1080
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
indeed

1081
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
there are

1082
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
two patients

1083
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
were removed

1084
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
due to complications

1085
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
one of them

1086
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
should be

1087
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
better

1088
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
but worse

1089
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
so

1090
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
we need to discuss

1091
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
why

1092
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
they did

1093
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
a series of

1094
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
assessments

1095
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the general question

1096
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
is about

1097
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
your background

1098
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
why did you

1099
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
switch from medical imaging

1100
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
to neuroscience

1101
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I was

1102
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
interested in

1103
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
imaging

1104
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
especially brain imaging

1105
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
when I was

1106
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
an intern

1107
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I was an intern

1108
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
in clinical trial

1109
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
at that time

1110
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
we had our first

1111
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
research institute

1112
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
we wanted to

1113
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
apply the imaging

1114
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
in clinical trial

1115
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
to

1116
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
neuropsychiatry

1117
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
not just

1118
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
X-ray

1119
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I was interested

1120
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and I read

1121
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a lot of books

1122
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
when I was

1123
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
an intern

1124
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I wanted to

1125
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
apply MRI

1126
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
to patients

1127
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
with mental

1128
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
or neuropsychiatric

1129
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
diseases

1130
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
but

1131
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
due to other reasons

1132
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I chose

1133
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
FMRI

1134
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
although

1135
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I did other

1136
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
experiments

1137
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
first

1138
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I wanted to do it

1139
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and second

1140
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I could only apply to

1141
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
neuroscience

1142
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
in Taiwan

1143
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
many students

1144
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
apply to

1145
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
radiology

1146
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
medical physics

1147
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but

1148
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
there is no

1149
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
radiology

1150
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
in Taiwan

1151
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
thank you

1152
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
for your answer

1153
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
do you have

1154
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
other questions?

1155
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
if not

1156
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I will

1157
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
ask another question

1158
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
thank you

1159
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
for your speech

1160
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I am not a

1161
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
neuroscientist

1162
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I am curious

1163
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
what do you think

1164
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
is the most difficult

1165
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
part of this research?

1166
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
collecting patient's data

1167
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
or marking

1168
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
brain areas

1169
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
which part

1170
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
do you think is the most difficult?

1171
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think the most difficult

1172
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
is how to

1173
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
write the result

1174
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
clearly

1175
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
so that patients

1176
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
can see it

1177
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
it is hard

1178
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
but I am not collecting data

1179
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we are collecting data

1180
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I know they spent a lot of time and effort

1181
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
but

1182
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
for me

1183
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the most difficult part is

1184
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
when we see the result

1185
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
how do we

1186
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
calculate the weighting

1187
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
we see in PRS

1188
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
we say weighting is important

1189
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
but if you tell a neuroscientist

1190
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I see this weighting

1191
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
he will think

1192
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
you think it is useful

1193
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
but I don't think so

1194
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I want to know

1195
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
how to treat patients

1196
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
so we spent a lot of time

1197
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
thinking

1198
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
how to write the result

1199
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
clearly

1200
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
in a language

1201
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that is suitable for

1202
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
clinical doctors

1203
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
so that they can know

1204
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
the result is effective

1205
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
for me

1206
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
the most difficult part

1207
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
is when we explain

1208
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
these variables

1209
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
the relation between positive and negative

1210
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is very complicated

1211
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
we need to

1212
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
write it in several layers

1213
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
the first layer

1214
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
is to explain the result

1215
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
positive or negative

1216
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
the second layer

1217
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
is to write

1218
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
because it represents

1219
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
the physiological meaning

1220
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
in this process

1221
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
we spent a lot of time

1222
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
but luckily

1223
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
when the paper was sent

1224
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
the feedback

1225
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
was good

1226
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
most people understood

1227
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
so we took a deep breath

1228
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
that sounds really good

1229
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
thank you

1230
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
it was special

1231
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
because I studied English

1232
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
so we never

1233
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
have the same field

1234
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
but you have

1235
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
clinical and academic

1236
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
you need to communicate

1237
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
like engineers

1238
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and physicists

1239
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
you need to communicate

1240
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
thank you

1241
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
do you have other questions?

1242
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
countdown

1243
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
3

1244
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
2

1245
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
1

1246
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
thank you

1247
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
for your participation

1248
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
thank you again

1249
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
thank you

1250
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Sujin

1251
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
thank you

1252
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
we have

1253
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
a questionnaire

1254
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I will turn off the recording
