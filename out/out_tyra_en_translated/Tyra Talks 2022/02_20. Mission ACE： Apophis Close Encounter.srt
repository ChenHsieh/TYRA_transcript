1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we are very honored to invite Dr. Liao Ying to talk about his research.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today's topic is Mission ACE.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Before we start, let me briefly introduce Dr. Liao Ying.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Dr. Liao Ying graduated from the University of Bern, Switzerland.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Dr. Liao Ying specializes in space and astrophysics.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He is currently a professor at Tsinghua University,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
teaching space exploration theory and practice.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Our tradition is to mute everyone,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
so that the speech will be more smooth.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But before we start, please unmute yourself,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
so that the speaker can hear our applause.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's welcome today's speaker with a round of applause.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I will probably speak a little faster.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let me briefly introduce myself.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My master's degree is in astrophysics.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
After that, I went to Switzerland to study.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We are still in the physics institute.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Our school has three branches.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One of the branches is called Space Science and Planetary Research.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In Chinese, it stands for 太空與新興科學.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The entire branch focuses on things like NASA and JPL.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I did a two-year postdoc at the University of Macau.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then I came back to Taiwan for COVID-19.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have been teaching at Tsinghua University since last year.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I teach space exploration theory and practice.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I teach in English.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tsinghua University does not teach space science,

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so I thought this would be a good place to start.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I am interested in solar systems,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
such as comets, asteroids,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and space mission design.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In 2019, I took part in a competition called

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
CubeSat Mission Design Contest.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am interested in space mission design.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I saw the competition in early 2019,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so I decided to take part in it.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I found two of my teammates.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We designed a mission together.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We were lucky to win first place.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Since then, I have been doing research on space mission design.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't say it is a rigorous research.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The topic I am going to talk about today is still a proposal.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My name is Ace.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is a very preliminary proposal.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you know a little bit about space mission design,

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
space mission design is very complicated.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It requires a lot of manpower and time to do different things.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will explain it later.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a proposal from our team.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is for another international space mission design competition,

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mission Idea Contest.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is a proposal for this competition.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We advanced to the finals, but we did not win.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would like to briefly explain Mission Idea Contest.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is an international space mission design competition.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It is organized by a non-profit organization called Unisec.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It is a non-profit organization.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It is organized by universities around the world.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It is organized by universities around the world.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It is organized by universities around the world.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Each country has a local chapter.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Taiwan has a local chapter.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Professor Zhuang is in charge of it.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This competition is held once a year.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This competition is held once a year.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There are three stages in this competition.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The first stage is to vote.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
After the judges have finished voting,

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
they will enter the next stage.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The next stage is to develop the paper into a complete one.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The last stage is to submit a verbal report.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
After submitting the verbal report,

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the judges will choose two candidates.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This competition is quite tough.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The judges are mostly professors.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The judges are mostly professors.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Sometimes they invite a few people from the company.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We had a host of the competition that year.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We had a host of the competition that year.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Their judges are very strict.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I recommend this competition.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The judges are different every year.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The topic of 2019 is to design an experiment at ISS.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
2020 and 2021 are being held.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
2020 is scheduled to be postponed for a year.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the Deep Space Mission we participated in last year.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The definition of deep space is

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the space beyond the moon.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
However, they also included the mission of the moon in the Deep Space.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So, you can design a space ship to go to the moon.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This year and next year,

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we will return to the Earth orbit mission design.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is a 6U cube satellite design.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
However, it requires a constellation.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can send a lot of stars at once.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They will have different positions.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's a bit like GPS satellites.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is a link.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you are interested in space mission design,

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you can go to their website.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Their website is complete.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Last year, they had a talk.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Deep Space Mission Design is a difficult topic.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They had a talk with professors from the University of Tokyo.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They recorded the talk and posted it on their website.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They also posted some PDFs.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can check them out.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I would like to talk about the background of space mission design.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
First, you need to know about the spacecraft.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Spacecraft is the soul of space mission design.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not used to speaking in Chinese.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I usually speak in English.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So, I might speak slowly or pause.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is a picture of the spacecraft.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a picture of a simple and powerful spacecraft.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is the attitude control.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is the power.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is the internal computer.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the command.

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is the communication.

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is the structure of the body.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the orbit.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is the orbit.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can connect the spacecraft to humans.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For example, the computer is like our brain.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Our brain receives, processes, and releases various commands.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We have a body.

138
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Our body is the head and limbs.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Our body is the head and limbs.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Communication is like our speech, gestures, and eyes.

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Power is like food.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Power is like food.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Power is like food.

145
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,000
Everyone uses a rough metaphor.

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's called understanding space.

147
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Use freedom as a metaphor.

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are six main functions.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There are six main functions.

150
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There are six main functions.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The first one is the body part.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The first one is the body part.

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
In English, we call it the body.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is a spaceship or a satellite.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is a spaceship or a satellite.

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In English, we call it a frame.

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In English, we call it a cube.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In English, we call it a cube.

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In English, we call it a cube.

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In English, we call it a cube.

161
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In English, we call it a cube.

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In English, we call it a cube.

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In English, we call it cmdh.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In English, we call it cmdh.

165
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In English, we call it cmdh.

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
In English, we call it cmdh.

167
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In English, we call it at2.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In English, we call it at2.

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In English, we call it eps.

170
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In English, we call it eps.

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In English, we call it eps.

172

In English, we call it eps.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In English, we call it eps.

177
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In English, we call it eps.

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In English, we call it eps.

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In English, we call it eps.

180
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
