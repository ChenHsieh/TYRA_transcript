00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TARA Talk.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
TARA stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
It is a friendly forum for young researchers in Taiwan.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
We hold TARA Talk every week and every weekend throughout the year.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
The format and content of this talk are very free and diverse.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Researchers can share their academic achievements,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
practice online presentations,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
or get to know potential future collaborators.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Today's speaker is...

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Wei-Zhe, would you like to share your screen?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Is it on?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes, it is.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Today's speaker is Wei-Zhe Xu.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
He is currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
in Chemical and Biological Engineering.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Today's talk is on Identifying Signature of...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce that word.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Protolytic Stability and Dimerization Properties.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
He is a simulator.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
He gave a wonderful talk at TARA.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
As usual at TARA,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
before the talk starts,

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
we will turn on the microphone and give a warm welcome to Wei-Zhe.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, thank you.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Should I start?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, you can start.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Hello everyone, I am Wei-Zhe Xu.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
My main interest in this course is to use...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
computer molecular dynamics simulations...

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
to study different biological and physical phenomena...

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
or develop related algorithms.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Thank you for coming to this talk.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Today's talk is similar to the one I gave at TARA.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
This is my first time to use Chinese...

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
to explain this academic research.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Please let me know if you have any questions.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
It's okay to interrupt me.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Without further ado, let's get started.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Today we are going to discuss...

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
how to use computer simulation...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
to find out the factors that affect...

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
the properties of the permutations.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Before we get into today's topic,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
let's take a look at what a permutation looks like.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
A permutation is a protein molecule.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
It is composed of two amino acids.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
The blue one and the yellow one.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
They are chain A and chain B.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
You may have heard of it.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The biggest relationship between a permutation and humans...

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
is that it is widely used in diabetes treatment.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
For example, there are 34 million people in the US...

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
who are diabetic.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
7 million of them use permutations...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
as their main treatment method.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Most of the treatment channels for permutations...

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
are done through subcutaneous injection.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Diabetic patients...

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
usually need to be injected 30 minutes before meals.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
This means that diabetes patients...

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
need to be injected 2-3 times a day.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
If you need to be injected 2-3 times a day,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
it will be very uncomfortable.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
The biggest drawback of subcutaneous injection...

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
is that it is very invasive.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
In the past 20 years,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
scientists have tried to develop...

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
non-invasive treatment channels...

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
to reduce the use of subcutaneous injection.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
One of the most potential treatment channels...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
is the so-called oral-diphtheria.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
20 years have passed.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
This research has been going on for more than 20 years.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Why is it that...

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
we don't hear much about...

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
oral-diphtheria drugs on the market?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
The reason is that...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
the development of oral-diphtheria drugs...

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
has many major challenges.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Most of these challenges...

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
come from the digestive system of the human body.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
The first challenge is that...

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
when the gastrointestinal tract goes through the human stomach,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
gastric acid will destroy the gastrointestinal structure.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
The gastrointestinal tract will lose its function.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Basically, this challenge...

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
has been completely solved...

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
some time ago.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Most of the mainstream use...

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
is to use some special materials to protect the gastrointestinal tract.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
The gastrointestinal tract can...

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
This special material...

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
will not be dissolved in the case of acidity.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
This can protect the gastrointestinal tract...

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
from being corroded by gastric acid.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
When leaving the stomach,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
the gastrointestinal tract...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
will be dissolved.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
The gastrointestinal tract will be dissolved.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
The drug will be released.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The first challenge has been solved.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But it was a major challenge...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
in the development of oral-diphtheria drugs.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
The next two challenges...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
have not been completely solved yet.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The first challenge is that...

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
the stability of the gastrointestinal system is not very good.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
The reason is that...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
many digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal system...

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
destroy the gastrointestinal tract.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
This will also cause the gastrointestinal tract to lose its function.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
In addition, the gastrointestinal tract...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
is not very transparent to the cell membrane.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Usually, we will see that...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
two gastrointestinal molecules...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
may gather together...

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and then...

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
become a so-called gastrointestinal 2-gene.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
This 2-gene...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
is a relatively large molecule.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So it is more difficult to pass through the cell membrane.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
The human body's absorption...

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
of gastrointestinal 2-gene...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
will also become lower.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So the following two challenges...

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
have not been completely solved yet.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Therefore, if we want to develop oral-diphtheria drugs,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
we know that...

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
we hope that oral-diphtheria drugs...

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
will achieve at least two goals.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
The first goal is that...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
we hope that it has enough resistance...

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
to the digestive enzymes in the human body.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
The second goal is that...

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
we hope that it has a relatively low gathering tendency...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
so that it is easier to reach a higher absorption...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
of gastrointestinal 2-gene.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
In the past few years,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
there have been a lot of different research methods...

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
to experiment with...

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
how to achieve these two goals at the same time.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
A few years ago,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
in a chemistry synthesis lab...

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
that we worked with,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
they found that...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
in a specific location of the gastrointestinal tract,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
a specific type of sugar can be added...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
to improve...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
the gastrointestinal tract's resistance...

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
to enzymes.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
In addition,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
it can effectively reduce its gathering tendency.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
This method is called sugarification.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Basically,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
it is the structure of...

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
a sugar molecule...

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
connected to a gastrointestinal tract.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
In the research...

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
conducted by our laboratory,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
they studied a total of 12 different...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
gastrointestinal tracts.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You can see that...

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
these 12 gastrointestinal tracts...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
basically have three control mutations.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
The first one is...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
the location of sugarification.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Here, you can see...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
my mouse.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
This is the structure of the gastrointestinal tract.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
These balls...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
are basically the amino acids...

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
that can be sugarified.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
There are a total of 51 amino acids in the gastrointestinal tract.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Only five of them...

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
can be added to sugar.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
The first mutation is...

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
the location of sugarification.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
The second mutation is...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
the type of sugar.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
For example, we can see here...

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
GALNAC.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
In English, it's N-Acetyl Glycosamin.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I'm not sure how to say it in Chinese,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
but it's a type of sugar.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
The other type of sugar is MANOS.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
The main purpose is to study...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
the sugarification mechanism of these two types of sugar.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
The third type is...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
the size of the type of sugar.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You can see that the last few types of sugar...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
from the 7th to the 13th...

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
basically use MANOS...

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
as the base of the type of sugar.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
They may use the type of sugar...

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
the type of MANOS...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
the type of MANOS-2 or type of MANOS-3...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
to modify the structure of the amino acid.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
For example,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
you can see that...

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
the picture here...

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
is the structure of a sugarified amino acid.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
The blue and yellow...

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
are the amino acids.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
The purple is...

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
the type of MANOS-3.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
The location of sugarification...

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
is the B27 amino acid.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
OK.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So...

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
in our...

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
collaborative lab...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
research,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
how did they...

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
from these different sugarified amino acids...

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
find a structure...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
that is more likely to be used as an amino acid...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
for oral medication?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They did a series of experiments.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Today, I'm going to talk about the most important one.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
First of all,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
they measured the resistance of the amino acids.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Basically,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I put the amino acids...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
and the sugarified amino acids...

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
in the same solution...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
to monitor...

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
when the amino acid...

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
is cut off.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Then, we can measure...

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
how long it takes...

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
for the sugarified amino acids...

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
to be broken down by the amino acids.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
The time it takes...

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
is called alpha-contription half-life.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Alpha-contription half-life...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
is the amino acid...

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
that our collaborative lab uses.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It can break down the amino acids.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Half-life means...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
the amino acids...

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
are cut into two parts.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So, they lose some of their quality.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
The weight is reduced.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So, we can detect...

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
the amino acids.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Basically, the longer it takes...

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
means that the amino acids...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
need to break down the amino acids.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The longer it takes...

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
means that the structure of the amino acids...

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
is more resistant to the amino acids.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
On the far left, we can see...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
the so-called wild-type.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's a circular amino acid.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
It doesn't go through any type of sugar.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We can see that...

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
in the 12 types of amino acids...

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
the numbers 9, 10, and 13...

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
are the half-life...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
of the alpha-contription half-life.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This means that...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
the amino acids need to break down...

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
the amino acids...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
for a longer time.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
This means that...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
the amino acids are more resistant to the amino acids.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
The important ones are 10 and 13.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
9 is a little bit higher than the wild-type.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
10 and 13 are significantly better...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
than the circular amino acids.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Coincidentally,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
these three structures...

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
also have...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
relatively low...

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
relative gathering tendency.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
On the right,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
you can see that...

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
the wild-type is on the far left.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
The three on the right are 9, 10, and 13.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
The blue part of the graph...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
shows the ratio of the amino acids.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
The green part...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
shows the ratio of the half-life.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
We hope that...

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
the lower the relative gathering tendency,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
the better.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
The higher the amino acid ratio,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
the better.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
We can see that...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
9, 10, and 13...

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
are more resistant to the amino acids.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
We can see that...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
these three amino acids...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
have relatively low relative gathering tendency.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
What is the most important discovery...

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
of this study?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The most important discovery is that...

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
if you look at the structure of 9, 10, and 13,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
its name is a little bit long.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's a little bit strange.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
But from its name,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
you can probably tell that...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
these three structures...

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
are all in the position of...

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
the B27.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The group that is connected to the B27...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
are the single-unit...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
2-gene...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
or 3-gene.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So, the most important discovery...

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
of this study is that...

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
scientists found that...

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
among these 10 kinds of...

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
amino acids,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
if we connect the single-unit...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
2-gene...

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
or 3-gene to the B27,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
it can effectively improve the quality...

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
of the amino acids.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It is more suitable to be used...

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
as an oral medication.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
We already know that...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
in the experiment...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
in the general chemical synthesis experiment,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
we are likely to be able to...

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
experiment with a dozen kinds of...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
amino acids one by one...

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
and then synthesize them one by one.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Then compare them one by one with wild-type...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
to identify which amino acid...

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
has the best quality.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
But if we want to find...

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
the best amino acid for oral medication,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
if we want to find the best...

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
amino acid,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
do we need to synthesize...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
thousands of kinds of...

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
amino acids?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Of course, this process...

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
is very time-consuming.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Usually, to synthesize...

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
an amino acid...

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
that does not exist in the natural world,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
it may take a few months.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
If it is long, it may take 1-2 years.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
So, when...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
chemical synthesizers...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
synthesize these amino acids,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
they think that...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
this is too much trouble...

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and too much time...

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and too much money.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Then they start to think that...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
if I can't quickly and efficiently...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
use chemical synthesis to complete this thing,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't know if computer simulation...

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
can do this thing.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
That's why...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
our co-worker...

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
came to us...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
to do a computer simulation.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The answer to this question is...

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
of course, it's possible.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
We can use computer simulation...

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
to predict...

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
which of the selected...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
amino acids...

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
may contain the best...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
amino acid.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Our simulation method...

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
is called molecular thermodynamics simulation.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Molecular thermodynamics simulation...

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
is a very vast subject.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It has a lot of...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
hundreds of...

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
different simulations.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Before I talk about...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
the common points of these simulations,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
we can think about...

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
a simple question about sports.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
For example, you start from...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
your door today.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You walk 1 meter every second.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Where will you be after 10 seconds?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
The answer is...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
you will be 10 meters away from your home.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
This is a very simple question...

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
about sports.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Most students in high school...

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
are familiar with...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
complex sports questions.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
For example, acceleration...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and force.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
These questions are basically...

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
as long as we know the starting speed...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
and starting position of an object...

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and we consider the force...

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and acceleration...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
we can estimate...

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
where the object will appear...

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
at a certain point in time.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
In a complex system,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
we can even know...

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
the position, speed...

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and acceleration of the object...

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
at any point in time...

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
or even the energy.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Basically,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
this is what molecular dynamics...

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
is doing.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
In simple terms,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
molecular dynamics...

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
is an effective way...

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
to solve...

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
a series of...

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Newton's second law...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and the Hamiltonian.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
How is molecular dynamics...

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
actually done?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
In a molecular dynamics simulation...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
we have a simulation box.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
In this simulation box...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
we put in all the...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
atoms and molecules we want to simulate.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
For example,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
if I want to simulate...

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
a permutation of a number...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I put the permutation of a number...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
into the simulation box.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I want to simulate...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
a water-soluble...

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
water-soluble...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
water-soluble...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
water-soluble...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
water-soluble.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
If I want to keep...

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
the system neutral...

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I add some...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
oxygen or nitrogen...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
to keep the system neutral.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Basically,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
in the...

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
simulation box...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
for each atom...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
for each atom and molecule...

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
we have the initial speed...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
speed, position...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and energy...

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and so on.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Through these initial conditions...

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
initial conditions...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
or initial conditions...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
if you've studied the equation...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
it's actually initial conditions.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
With these initial conditions...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
we can calculate...

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
all the atoms...

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
at a certain point in the future...

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
the position...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
the speed...

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
the energy...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and so on.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
In a molecular dynamic simulation...

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
we can know...

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
in the simulation box...

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
how each object...

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
moves...

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
or even...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
in our case...

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
how the inner structure...

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
is close or far from each other.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
The animation you see now...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
you can see different parts...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
moving around.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Basically,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
molecular dynamic simulation...

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
allows us to see...

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
how an atom...

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
or an atom and an atom...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
interact with each other.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
With the method...

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
we can define...

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
the goal of our research.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Our method is...

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
molecular dynamic simulation.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Our goal is...

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
to build a simulation...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
so we don't have to...

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
do chemical synthesis.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We can find...

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
the most likely...

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
high-resistance...

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
and low-resistance structure...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
from a series of...

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
carboxylic acids.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
This is our overall goal.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
In order to build...

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
this simulation method...

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
we basically focus on...

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
the 12 elements...

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
of carboxylic acids...

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
studied by experimentalists.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
In the simulation...

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
we first find...

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
5 elements of carboxylic acids.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Starting from these 5 elements...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
each of them...

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
is like a template.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Each template...

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
can be used to generate...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
12 carboxylic acids.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
There are 65 elements...

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
in the template.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Each of these 65 elements...

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
is a long enough...

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
molecular dynamic simulation.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
The basic logic...

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
is that...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
we run a carboxylic acid simulation...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
followed by a carboxylic acid simulation.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
We compare...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
the trajectories...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
or the physical properties...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
to see if there are any differences.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
We try to figure out...

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
what are the causes...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
that lead to...

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
carboxylic acid resistance...

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
or carboxylic acid resistance.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
We know that...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
the entire process...

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
is...

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
just by looking at...

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
the carboxylic acid simulation...

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
we can't see anything.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Too many atoms and molecules...

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
are moving at the same time.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Many things...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
have to be...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
quantified in the simulation.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
The workflow...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
is to set up a hypothesis.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
We can assume that...

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
a certain amount of carboxylic acid...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
is...

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
able to affect...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
or the carboxylic acid resistance.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Then we use the simulation...

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
to calculate the amount of carboxylic acid...

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and compare it with the experiment.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
If it matches the experiment...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it means that the hypothesis...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
is plausible.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
If it doesn't match...

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
it means that the hypothesis...

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
is not plausible.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
In this research...

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
we set up many different hypotheses...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
for two types of carboxylic acid resistance...

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
and carboxylic acid resistance.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
There are many words here.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I won't explain them one by one...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
because they will be mentioned later.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Let's take a look...

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
at the hypothesis.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
First, we will focus on...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
of the carboxylic acid.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Then we will look back...

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
at the togethering of carboxylic acid.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Then we will look at...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
of the carboxylic acid.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And then we will...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
talk about the interaction between...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
The interaction between...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
is mainly...

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
The first step is...

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I simplify it.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
The mechanism is...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
First, the carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
will be combined.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
After that, the carboxylic acid will cut...

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
some positions of the carboxylic acid.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Then cut the carboxylic acid into two halves...

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
or even three halves...

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
three parts, four parts, etc.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But basically, as long as the carboxylic acid is cut...

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
it will lose its function.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
In all 51 amino acids of carboxylic acid...

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
five of them...

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
may be...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
cut off by alpha-carbotripsin...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
the carboxylic acid.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
The two places...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
that are most likely to be cut off...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
are B25 and B26...

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
the two amino acids.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
You can see here...

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
some of the rings...

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
are the structure of the carboxylic acid.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
They will be cut off.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Where is the cut off?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
For example,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
for B25 carboxylic acid...

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
the cut off is between...

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
B25 and B26...

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
the part of the carboxylic acid.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
For B26 carboxylic acid...

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
the cut off is between...

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
B26 and B27...

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
the part of the carboxylic acid.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Based on this understanding...

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
we know that...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
the carboxylic acid...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
needs to be cut off.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
There is a necessary factor...

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
that is...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
the carboxylic acid...

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
needs to be cut off...

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
The whole set of logic...

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
that we study...

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
is to see...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
what is the necessary factor...

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
that needs to be cut off.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
We need to see...

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
if there is a way...

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
to destroy the necessary factor.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
In this case...

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
the necessary factor is...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
that the carboxylic acid...

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
needs to be cut off...

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
The first assumption...

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
is that...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
if the carboxylic acid is stored...

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
inside the carboxylic acid...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
it won't be cut off.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
This assumption means that...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
the structure...

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
has a higher resistance to carboxylic acid.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
This is a full assertion.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
We assume that if a...

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
sugar is added to the carboxylic acid...

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
the cut-off sugar is...

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
guaranteed to be stored inside.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
This is a possible...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and effective mechanism.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
What do we need to do in this simulation?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
How do we quantify this?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
How do we quantify this?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
How do we quantify this?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
We measure something called SASA.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
On paper, this means that...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
the surface area...

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
of a carboxylic acid...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
in the carboxylic acid environment.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This means that...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
the larger the SASA...

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
the larger the surface area...

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
of the carboxylic acid.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
We assume that...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
the carboxylic acid...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
is exposed outside.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
If it's covered inside...

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
it may not even be exposed to water.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
So our assumption today is...

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
if a carboxylic acid...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
can lower the SASA...

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
of the carboxylic acid B25 and B26...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
it is very likely...

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
that it can raise the resistance...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
of the carboxylic acid...

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
to the carboxylic acid.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Let's take a look...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
This diagram looks a bit complicated...

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
but basically...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
B25 and B26...

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
are the SASA...

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
of two different positions.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The axis...

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
is the time it takes...

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
for the carboxylic acid...

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
to digest the carboxylic acid.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
the simplest way...

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
since there are many data points...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the simplest way...

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
is to look at the numbers 10 and 13...

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
the two carboxylic acids.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Numbers 10 and 13...

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
are the two carboxylic acids...

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
that have the highest resistance...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
to the carboxylic acid...

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
in the experiment.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
We can see that...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
these two carboxylic acids...

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
have a half-life...

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
longer than the other carboxylic acids.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
This is the result of the experiment.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It shows that...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
is higher in the experiment.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
We can also see that...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
these two carboxylic acids...

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
especially number 13...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
have the lowest SASA value.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
This means that...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
when the SASA value is low...

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
can be improved.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Although...

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
number 10 and 13...

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
seem to be consistent...

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
with the experiment results...

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
there are many exceptions.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
For example, in the square on the right...

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
we can see that...

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
the half-life of the carboxylic acid...

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
is relatively low.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
This means that...

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
is relatively low.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
However, the SASA value...

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
is actually in the middle.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
This is contrary...

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
to the experiment results.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
So, from this...

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
measurement method...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
we can only know that...

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
the SASA measurement method...

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
can only give us...

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
partial accurate prediction.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
For those...

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
carboxylic acids...

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
with high SASA resistance...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
their prediction may be accurate.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
However, for those...

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
in the middle value...

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
their prediction ability...

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
is not so good.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Obviously, we have to...

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
find a better...

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
model...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to...

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
to model this phenomenon.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Basically, this model...

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
the first model...

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
is to look at...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
the interface between...

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
the transfer function and the coefficient.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
The second model...

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
is based on...

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
the 2-level structure of the transfer function.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
First of all, the 2-level structure of the transfer function...

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
is related to...

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
the location of the carboxylic acid.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Let's look at...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
this graph.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
This circle represents...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
the carboxylic acid...

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
which is B25 or B26.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
The location of the carboxylic acid...

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
is C and P1'.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
P1' is the carboxylic acid next to C.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It is...

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
the direction of the carbon.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The opposite direction is...

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
P1, P2 and P3.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
In the past experiments...

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
we found that...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
the area from P1 to P3...

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
is usually...

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
from the past experiments...

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
the area from P1 to P3...

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
is usually...

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
from the past experiments...

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
the area from P1 to P3...

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
is the omega3 structure...

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
in the combination with...

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
alpha-carbotrypsin.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
This omega3 structure...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
is a necessary factor...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
required...

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
for therefore,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
for example,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
our target omega3...

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
oding is very important.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
loss of atoms is between B25 and B26.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Which means...

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
from P1 to P3 are equal to...

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
if we take B25 as an example,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
P1 is 24,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
followed by 2 3 2 2,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
for B26,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
P1 P2 P3 are 23-25.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
If we take both actions,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
B25-B26,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
we need to consider B22-B25,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
P1-P3,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
the 2-level structure.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Here,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
our assumption is

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
if P1-P3

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
become

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
the lower the beta-shear tendency,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
it will be able to

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
increase the antiparticle resistance.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Here,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I would like to remind you that

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
our logic is always the same.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
When we assume

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the beta-shear is

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
the necessary condition

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
for the antiparticle resistance,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
we will try to break this condition.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Let's assume that

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
P1-P3

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
become the lower the beta-shear tendency,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
it will be able to

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
avoid the antiparticle resistance.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
In simulation,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
how do we calculate

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
the beta-shear tendency

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
in this region?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Here is a graph called

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Raman-Schrödinger plot.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I won't go into details here.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Basically,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
it measures

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
each amino acid,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
we are interested in amino acids,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
B22-B25,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
each amino acid,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
and locate

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
the location of

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
each point

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
in the graph.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
The more red points

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
appear in this region,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
it means

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
the higher the antiparticle resistance

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
is.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
We hope that

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
the lower the beta-shear tendency.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Let's see

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
the simulation data.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Here,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
the graph looks

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
a bit complicated,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
so I won't

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
go into details.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Basically,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
here is the conclusion.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We found that

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
the beta-shear tendency

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
of P1 to P3

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
is not related to

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
the antiparticle resistance

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
of the guide tree.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Some of them

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
are not even related.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
This means

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
our hypothesis

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
is wrong.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
The reason is

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
that

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
if you are interested,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I can explain it later.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Basically,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
the takeaway here

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
is that

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
the second hypothesis is still wrong.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Since the second hypothesis is still wrong,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
we have to think about the third hypothesis.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Let me

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
help you review.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
The first hypothesis

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
is based on

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
the difference between

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
the antiparticle resistance

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
of P1 to P3.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
The second hypothesis

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
is based on

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
the second structure of the guide tree.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
The third hypothesis

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
is based on

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
the interaction between

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
the guide tree

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
and the antiparticle resistance

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
of P1 to P3.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
In the past,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
we found that

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
interacts with

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
the protein

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
that can be cut

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
by alpha-chromotrypsin.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
In this example,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
we can see

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
that

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
the yellow circle

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
is the part of the guide tree.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The square below

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
is the amino acid

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
of alpha-chromotrypsin.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
In the past,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
we found that

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
alpha-chromotrypsin interacts

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
with the amino acid of

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
The interaction between

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
alpha-chromotrypsin and

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
is very common.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
The four groups

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
are the standard

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
interactions

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
between the

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and the

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
In this example,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
interacts with

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
the amino acid of

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
The interaction between

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
and

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
is very common.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
The interaction between

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
and

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
is very common.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
In the case of

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
alpha-chromotrypsin,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
the interaction

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
between

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
is very common.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
We found that

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
the interaction between

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
and

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
is very common.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
The biggest difference between

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
alpha-chromotrypsin and

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
alpha-chromotrypsin is that

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
alpha-chromotrypsin contains

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
a type of sugar,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
whereas alpha-chromotrypsin

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
does not.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Let's assume that

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the addition of

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
a type of sugar

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
can disrupt

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
the network of

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
In other words,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
if alpha-chromotrypsin

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
prefers sugar

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
as a donor,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
alpha-chromotrypsin will

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
interact with sugar

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
to create

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
a bond between

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
For example,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
there are several couples

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
in front of you

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
and you want to

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
disrupt the bond between

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
them,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
so you throw down

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
a type of sugar,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
like alpha-chromotrypsin.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Alpha-chromotrypsin

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
and

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
form a new bond.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Let's assume that

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
sugar can disrupt

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
the network of

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and alpha-chromotrypsin.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Let's see

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
if simulation

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
supports this assumption.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
First,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
we can see

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
the two structures

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
with the highest

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
We know that

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
10 and 13

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
have the highest

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
13 is the first one.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
13,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
we call it

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
the adsorption power

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
which can be

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
caused by

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
and

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
13

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
has four

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
adsorption power

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
with

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
the highest

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
9

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
has two

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
adsorption power.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
5 and 12

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
have similar

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
adsorption power

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
with alpha-chromotrypsin.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Therefore,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
as long as there is

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
adsorption power,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
is better

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
for alpha-chromotrypsin.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
We can see

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
as long as there is

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
more adsorption power,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
is better for

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
The rest

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
are

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
alpha-chromotrypsin

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
with lower

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
adsorption power

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
than

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Only

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
number 6

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
has lower

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
adsorption power

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Although

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
number 6
