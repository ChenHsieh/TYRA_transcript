1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you, Yen-Yung.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have talked about how to join Project Terra.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today, we are going to start the lecture.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Before we start, let me introduce the speaker.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today's speaker is Professor Hsieh Ming-Hsiu from Sydney University of Science and Technology.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Professor Hsieh is also a senior at NTU.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In 2008, he got his Ph.D. from the University of Sydney.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He has worked in Japan and Cambridge.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
His research direction from Ph.D. to now is related to quantum computer and quantum information.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
His more detailed direction is related to quantum information.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,000
From the beginning of error correction to focus on quantum machine learning and different projects.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Next, Professor Hsieh will introduce his research.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
By the way, I would like to promote that NTU will have a team this year.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I hope we can work on quantum computing together.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you are interested, I believe Professor Hsieh can introduce the team later.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There are electrical engineering and physics.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think this is a big project.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I hope Professor Hsieh can introduce the team later.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I believe this project is good for Taiwan's research.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Professor Hsieh, you can start.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello everyone, my name is Hsieh.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you, Hsieh Ming-Hsiu.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am very happy to share with you today.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The Minister of Science and Technology has a SOC in NTU.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
System on Chip.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They have a front page.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They will find some front page topics every year.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This year they chose quantum computation.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They invited me to give a speech.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ted just mentioned that.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now Taiwan is starting to pay attention to quantum computation.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hardware or software development.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Ministry of Science and Technology has started to invest.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course, there are many in Taiwan.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But there are very few overseas.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This year, there are about 7,000 to 7,500 million.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now they have set up a center for quantum technology in NTU.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a five-year plan.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are 50 million in a year.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Ministry of Science and Technology has 25 million.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Ministry of Education has 25 million.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am also in charge of the International Advisory Board.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
After Taiwan started to invest in this place.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There are many opportunities.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you happen to be in the field.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In fact, there are many people in this field.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because quantum computing is a very cross-field.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can also find it in my talk later.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It also has a lot to do with CS.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It also needs to do these things now.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
For example, quantum control needs to be micro-wave controlled.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So traditional micro-wave people can also come in.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then look at what your process is.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Semiconductor talents can also come in.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Superconductor talents can also come in.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
These classic physics people can also come in.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So no matter what field you are.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Engineering, science, or electronics.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
As long as you are interested in quantum computing.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can come in very quickly.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In fact, I also studied a master's degree in Taiwan University.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a telecommunications company.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then I went to Nanyang University to study for a doctorate.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I just switched to quantum error correction.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then slowly do some information computation.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then I did a lot of other things.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So what is it like to cross-field with students from science and engineering colleges?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Some background introduction.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Then there's my talk.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because I mainly prepared for the SOC workshop.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's only 40 minutes.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I probably only have 40 minutes of material.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then you can use Q&A later.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
See what kind of questions you have about this direction.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You can bring it up.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Of course, in the middle of my report later.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can also bring up any questions you have.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me remind you.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because we have a lot of participants today.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we have a prediction.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The microphone is off when everyone enters.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So if you want to ask a question.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please click on the microphone icon above.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This way you won't feel ignored.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We usually welcome questions at any time.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But I'm afraid there's a lot of responses today.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So when you ask a question.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please click on the icon.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, let's get started.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, I'll continue my report.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is my title page.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I mainly want to introduce some.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because we know that machine learning.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now it's a very popular topic.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Quantum Computation is another popular topic.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Quantum Computation.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Basically, everyone has a vague idea about it.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That is, it can be used to do some.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
High-performance operations.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, uh.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So, uh.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
About three or five years ago.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In fact, earlier.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Someone started to notice that.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How to use quantum computers.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
To do some machine learning tasks.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But it was said that the early development was slower.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because everyone said.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Especially in academia.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
People will think that.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Your effect on your quantum mechanics.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then your quantum computer.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The power of this computation.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your definitions are not very clear yet.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
To do this quantum machine learning.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It seems to be a bit, uh.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A little bit of this.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Uh, it's a little unrealistic.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, uh.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, uh.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Before 2010.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That is, in this quantum machine learning topic.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact, very few people do it.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then, uh.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The main results are also relatively limited.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, uh.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Until the last three or five years.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That is, everyone has been from this.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uh, this technology.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In this news.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For general public news.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You also find that.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh, all the big companies have invested.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Google, IBM.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Microsoft, Intel.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Especially like Intel, IBM, Google.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They all have more than 50 qubits of machine.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That is to say, their, this.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Highway development can already be 50 qubits.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In fact, you can already do a little bit.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A little something like this.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, uh.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In the academic world, everyone started to go back and say.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In fact, quantum computers may still be used.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
To do some.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Uh, the operation of this big data.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So that's why this quantum machine learning.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the last few years.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Very, uh.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Very hot.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So, uh.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Uh, so in 2017.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In Nature.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh, this journal, it has.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Two reviewed articles.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That is, two of the same.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh, the same, uh.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The same, uh, the same value.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And then it just happened to be the first two.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Uh, it's all in the review of this quantum machine.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Uh, uh, uh.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What about me?

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This slide is from.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
One of the review articles.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It was taken out, it was by Monta, this person.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uh, it's written like this.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He actually said.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He did some summary, which means he took it to.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Before 2017, that is to say.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Uh, which one.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can do it with quantum computation.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And then?

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What kind of acceleration does it have?

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Uh, on the far left.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's actually just.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's just, uh, it's classification.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are the problems like this?

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For example, he has that dangerous inference.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Uh.

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Uh, let's say perceptron perceptron.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's like classification.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh, let's say.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The left and right, or if it's linear.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's what you're going to do.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Uh, and then.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Uh.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The third is fitting.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's similar to what we used to have in curve fitting.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You'll see your curve is probably.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If it's a very complicated curve.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For example, you can use linearity or sine wave to.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
To fit this curve.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Uh, then.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh, the fourth is the Boltzmann machine.

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We're probably just saying this is more statistical.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Uh.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's classical Boltzmann machine.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Of course, there's a corresponding quantum Boltzmann machine.

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh, that Boltzmann machine is also this.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Uh, uh.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh, similar to neural network.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's actually a very similar concept.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And then there's PCA.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Uh, Principle Component Analysis.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Uh, this is basically.

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
PCA is also a machine learning.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Uh, one.

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Uh, a very weird study.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A problem like this.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You have a covariance matrix.

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Then you have to put it in a right angle.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After that, you just need to focus on.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A relatively large value.

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So they're called, uh.

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Principle component.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The biggest one, the biggest one, the biggest one.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It means that it affects your distribution.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is relatively large.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you cut off some of the smaller ones.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Uh, the value.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh, this is what classical PCA is doing.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Uh, uh, and then there's SVM.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is actually called a vector.

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Uh, supporting vector.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Basically, it's also part of this.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Uh, classification problem.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Um, the second column?

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The second row on the left is to say that this is the acceleration on the value.

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Uh, uh, uh.

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Uh, it means, uh,

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
for example, uh,

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Perceptron, it has this, uh,

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Square root, it's called the acceleration of square root n.

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's your sample size.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you have a point, you're going to do the classification.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then use the value, it will have one.

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Probably, uh,

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So there's this acceleration.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Some of the questions it has a value acceleration.

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Log n is the value of the value of the value.

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And then, uh,

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You see some signals in this place.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In fact, this signal is

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's actually these accelerations.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There are some conditions.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It has some assumptions, so it's not

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you're going to

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh, from this classical

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
To the classical

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Its acceleration will not

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
To the value of the value

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's just that, uh, my classical

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Data, I have to map it first.

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Map to a quantum state

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Quantum state is your quantum

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
A type that the computer can handle

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Is, uh, your input

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
To a quantum machine

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You must have one, just say this

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
An input that the machine can accept

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's it, so you're from classical

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Data to map to this quantum data

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Where is this place

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
In fact, there is a, uh

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There is a trade-off

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's basically impossible to do very well now

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Because you can imagine

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The classical data, I must have every data

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I have to read it once, so you can

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Map it over, right?

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Uh, so

274
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In this place, you must be

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
With your data size

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There is already a proportional relationship

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What about these accelerations

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's usually just looking at

279
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I already have a preprocessing

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Map it to the quantum state

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And then it can

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What about the calculation of these quantities

283
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It has this index acceleration

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is what this signal means

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's it

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But if there is no signal, this is

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, uh, it's

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Overall, I can have an index

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The acceleration of this square root n

290
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay, what about this a

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's actually a call

292
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This algorithm

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Then I will introduce it later

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's actually a global

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Uh, a more advanced version of global search

296
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Then I will introduce

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Global search

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Then this place means y

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That is to say, in these methods

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It actually uses this

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Amplitude amplification or global

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Search like this

303
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then the other one is hhl

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a quantum

305
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Very famous algorithm now

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll introduce it later. It's actually used to solve the linear equation.

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you say

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Quantum computation

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Quantum algorithm to solve the linear equation

310
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It will have an index acceleration

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then we know that machine learning

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Uh, a lot of problems

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can map it to the solution

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So you can do this

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can just use this hhl algorithm

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
To solve

317
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm not familiar with this piece

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So I didn't go to

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go to

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't explain much

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's what I just said

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You have to put classical data

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Map to quantum state

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Basically you need an encoding step

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then this is what qrem is doing

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
N means

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This method, for example, the first

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Bayesian inference, it doesn't use

329
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This qrem place

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because qrem is actually a

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's a more complicated operation

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So you can jump as much as you can

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can try not to use it

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't use it

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Ok

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is there a problem?

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No problem, I'll go down

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Introduce this

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
From here

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will introduce some quantum algorithms

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why is there an index acceleration?

343
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Basically because there are these

344
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
These are more basic

345
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This quantum algorithm

346
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
As your

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This

348
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
From

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The more complicated algorithm

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then do more complicated things

352
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Then I introduced these

353
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
These are more fundamental

354
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There are a few

355
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Basically you are going to read these textbooks

356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There are already introductions in the textbooks

357
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I basically know here

358
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Everyone is not doing this

359
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Quantum information or computation

360
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I basically only talk about the results

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Everyone can basically have an impression

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The first one is Fourier transform

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why is quantum computation

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's so useful because

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Quantum

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You can let you go

367
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Do

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do the action of superposition

369
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your state

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Your state is

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
For example, we are 0 1, right?

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Quantum state is 0 1

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Superposition

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What about this superposition

375
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That is, you can use parallel operations

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You can

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can do a 0 operation

378
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Do a 1 operation

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then correspond to it

380
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Its superposition will correspond to

381
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Your operation will superposition

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Quantum mechanics is a linear

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Linear

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What about this place

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So why

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Quantum computer

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why is it so effective

388
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because of this quantum Fourier transform

389
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If we talk about science students

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Everyone knows what Fourier transform is doing

391
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That is, he wants to put a state

392
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Plus this

393
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Plus this face

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is called Fourier coefficient

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This omega n xk

396
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If you say there are n bits

397
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Then your capital n

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is the square root of 2n

399
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is what you do to n bits

400
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A Fourier transform

401
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Then my notation is actually

402
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Quantum notation

403
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Basically this x

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There is a

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This place

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This place

407
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's actually a quantum state

408
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can think of it as a vector

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is a

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That is to say there are 2n

411
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
One

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A vector element that is a

413
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This technical detail

414
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It doesn't matter if you don't need to know

415
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then

416
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can't introduce this Fourier transform

417
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The introduction is too detailed, I just want to tell you

418
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What is the difference between it and classical

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Our science students

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Everyone knows that classical Fourier transform

421
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How many operations do you need

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If you say you have n

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
n bits

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The operation you need is n

425
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Multiplied by the value of 2

426
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
n square

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So it is

428
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not just it's polynomial

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In number of bits

430
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's exponential in number of bits

431
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is what classical Fourier transform needs

432
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's n times 2n

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So many operations

434
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You need so many operations

435
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But in quantum Fourier transform

436
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You only need

437
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
n square

438
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That is to say, n is your number of bits

439
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So you have a place

440
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Uh, uh, the acceleration of the index

441
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Uh, exponential speed

442
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Uh, exponential speed

443
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That

444
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Uh, the reason for this

445
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Of course, it just happens to be this operation

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Can be divided into this bit

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Single qubit operation and this two qubit operation

448
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then you add it up

449
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That is to say, its operation

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You can decompose it into this elementary quantum gate

451
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then it just needs n

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
n square and so many

453
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, if you're interested in this

454
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can go to Wikipedia

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's also very simple

456
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you have a background in physics

457
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's easy to understand

458
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Uh, so this place has an index

459
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So your algorithm if you need

460
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If you use quantum Fourier transform

461
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You just have a big acceleration

462
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And then this

463
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Uh, and then you

464
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This, uh, quantum Fourier transform

465
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It will be used in some

466
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
More complicated this is called phase estimation

467
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In this algorithm

468
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I will introduce phase in a moment

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I will introduce phase estimation in the next slide

470
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because phase estimation is a very important algorithm

471
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay, what is phase estimation doing?

472
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What is phase estimation doing?

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It is to estimate your eigenvalue

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That is to say, suppose I have a unitary

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
U, and then

476
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I have one, uh, this vector

477
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is the eigenvector of U

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Psi, right?

479
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Then we know that your U

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Multiply by your eigenvector

481
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You will take your eigenvalue

482
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It will be equal to the eigenvalue multiplied by your eigenvector

483
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Right?

484
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Then this phase estimation is to estimate

485
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Because of your eigenvalue

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Because it is unitary, it is only related to this theta

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Right? So we're going to estimate this theta

488
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Right? So we're going to estimate this theta

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Uh, what about this?

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What about this estimation?

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That is to say, this place is also

492
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That is, uh, this take-home message is like this

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Uh, there is a quantum algorithm

494
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Uh, there is a quantum algorithm

495
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It can estimate your eigenvalue

496
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Can estimate your eigenvalue

497
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's very efficient

498
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's very efficient

499
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How about this?

500
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
How about this?

501
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It can use all 1 over

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It can use all 1 over

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It can use all 1 over

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you say, if your requirement is

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you say, if your requirement is

506
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It just needs all 1 over

507
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to calculate this eigenvalue

508
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then we know

509
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
In fact, many later algorithms

510
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
In fact, many later algorithms

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The most important part of it is

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I have a matrix

513
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because quantum mechanics

514
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can use this matrix to express

515
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You can use this matrix to express

516
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
A matrix

517
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What do you need to focus on?

518
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Just the place where its eigenvalue is large

519
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Just the place where its eigenvalue is large

520
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So we can use some

521
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Fastest method

522
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Make some changes

523
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Then let it just estimate this

524
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Bigger eigenvalue

525
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Then you can

526
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Smaller eigenvalue

527
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Truncate it

528
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then this truncate

529
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It basically doesn't affect

530
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because if you look at its distance

531
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
For example, trace distance

532
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's basically just comparing its eigenvalue

533
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So if you truncate a smaller eigenvalue

534
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So if you truncate a smaller eigenvalue

535
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And then

536
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Like this Fastest method

537
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It uses, for example, I just mentioned

538
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Hhl is the solution

539
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Linear equation algorithm

540
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It should be the most famous

541
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It should be the most famous

542
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It can be used to do

543
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The value factor is highly efficient

544
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It can be used to do

545
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The value factor is highly efficient

546
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It can

547
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It can

548
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's so effective

549
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's it

550
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's it

551
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's it

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's it

553
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Here

554
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Here

555
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Here

556
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This

557
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This

558
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This

561
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This place is in classical

562
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Actually there is no way to avoid

563
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We know that we used to be on

564
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It should be high school

565
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Is the Gauss elimination method

566
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I have n variables n equations

567
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I just delete one variable first

568
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Then slowly delete all the variables

569
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Until the last variable and then push it back

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is the Gauss elimination method

571
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then, but in quantum

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
If you say this x is a quantum state

573
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It already has superposition to help you

574
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then v is also a quantum state

575
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
To do this

576
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You only need to log n

577
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
n is the size of your matrix

578
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The matrix of this a

579
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is n by n

580
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Then you only need to log n so much

581
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Then we know that the Gauss elimination method

582
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You probably need n squared

583
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Steps like this

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then this

585
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This place is actually in major

586
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This matrix a is

587
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How regular

588
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How should it be said

589
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The biggest eigenvalue and the smallest eigenvalue

590
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You don't want it to be too different

591
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So this kappa is a bit

592
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This linear equation

593
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
In the end

594
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
His

595
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What is his behavior

596
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So this is actually a technical condition

597
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It doesn't matter if you don't care first

598
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Everyone basically only compares this log n

599
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Then

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In the best classic algorithm

601
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
In fact, it is n

602
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If your matrix is n by n

603
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You don't need to do so many operations

604
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Basically with the Gauss elimination method

605
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A little better than the Gauss elimination method

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is actually a teacher at MIT

607
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Aaron Harrow

608
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They are all at MIT

609
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They proposed it in 2009

610
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You see, it's less than 10 years

611
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This breakthrough within 10 years

612
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This article until now

613
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It seems that I have almost 600 citations

614
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's because of the quantum algorithm

615
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's all up

616
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Then this machine learning also got up

617
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A lot of this step

618
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This matrix

619
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Inversion step, so now citation

620
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This paper is very high

621
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So it's the same

622
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's like this

623
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Linear equation

624
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The quantum algorithm has an index acceleration

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's it

626
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay, then

627
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The other one is that in addition to HHL

628
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The other one is most commonly used in machine learning

629
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Is global search

630
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What is global search?

631
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Then this data space

632
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You don't need to have some structure

633
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's an unsorted search

634
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Then use this global search

635
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What about this quantum algorithm

636
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It will have the acceleration of square root n

637
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What about this square root n

638
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
n is your

639
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This size of the database

640
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Sorry

641
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Then basically global search

642
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What are you doing?

643
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
If my omega is an n-bit sequence

644
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I wrote it into this vector form

645
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's like this

646
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Then this

647
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Every omega is a 0 1 bit

648
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Every omega i

649
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Is a 0 1 bit

650
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Then I just want from this

651
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
All of this bit sequence

652
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This ps below me is all of the bit sequence

653
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The superposition

654
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I want to identify from the inside

655
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A particular

656
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This omega

657
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
From a uniform superposition

658
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I want to identify this omega

659
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is what global search is doing

660
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That global is basically

661
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Very simple

662
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It uses two very elementary

663
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This operation

664
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
This is basically

665
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
These two are reflection

666
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Is to reverse

667
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I have a picture below

668
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That is

669
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It is a

670
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Geometry picture like this

671
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I use this picture to show

672
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's called omega

673
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This y-axis

674
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This omega is what I want to estimate

675
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
What about this s

676
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is all of the state

677
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Uniform superposition

678
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because omega is also in this s

679
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So

680
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Sorry

681
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There is a call

682
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Because omega is also in this s

683
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
An element

684
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This omega is positive

685
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But you can

686
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's positive with this omega

687
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
This

688
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OK

689
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That

690
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What about the two operations just now

691
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
One is US, one is UW

692
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That is, there are two operations in the previous slide

693
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
What are these two operations doing

694
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That is, this UW

695
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This operation is for this s

696
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This one

697
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This plane

698
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It is s

699
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You use this u

700
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Omega this operation is used in s

701
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's actually s, this s, this place

702
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Do a flip for s prime

703
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So when you do the first step, it will flip here

704
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The following gray line

705
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Can everyone see it?

706
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Should be right

707
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can see it

708
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because it's too quiet

709
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know if I can see it like this

710
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
OK

711
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Do the first flip

712
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It will become the gray line below

713
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Right then

714
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's the second flip

715
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is to flip to s

716
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So it's now this gray line

717
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Will run to the top here

718
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If you assume that at first

719
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
s and s prime

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
s and s prime

721
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Is the angle of theta over 2

722
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Then you do the first flip

723
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You will be here below

724
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Here is also theta over 2

725
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Then you flip to s now

726
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It will go up here

727
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There is a theta angle, right?

728
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That is to say, you did a round

729
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That is to say, u omega and us

730
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
After doing a round

731
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You actually put s this angle

732
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
s this s this vector

733
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Up to the direction of omega

734
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Then you just need it now

735
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Your goal now

736
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Is to let you repeat this step

737
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let the last

738
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It can be close to omega

739
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Right, you just let it keep flipping

740
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
To omega flip to where you want

741
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Then you can search

742
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Search to the value you want

743
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This global

744
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
In fact, it is very interesting that he is not doing quantum information

745
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He only has one

746
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
One to two pieces of quantum paper

747
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He basically proposed this global search

748
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Classical

749
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
He is a classic CS person

750
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Then he mentioned this very interesting result

751
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Then he is very famous now

752
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
This is a very fundamental

753
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
A quantum algorithm

754
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Because this is a search algorithm

755
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And it is your data space

756
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
No need to have

757
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No need to have assumptions

758
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So it is an unsorted search

759
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So it is very useful

760
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It is in many algorithms

761
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is a global search

762
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Ok

763
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Uh

764
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Uh

765
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I need to introduce one

766
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Because the progress of quantum machine learning

767
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Very fast

768
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Then the progress of 2017

769
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This review article

770
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
In fact, it has been a bit

771
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There have been a lot of results in the past year

772
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
There is a very interesting result

773
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Is the recommendation system

774
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Uh

775
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Recommendation system I think everyone knows

776
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You do online shopping

777
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Or you watch netflix

778
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You watch netflix

779
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
After you choose

780
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You can finally say

781
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Give him a star

782
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
See if you like five stars

783
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Or three stars

784
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Do you like it

785
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He has an algorithm

786
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Will recommend you a similar movie

787
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Online shopping is the same

788
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What did you buy

789
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Will recommend you something like

790
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So this is the recommendation system

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Uh system is doing

792
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That uh

793
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Recommendation system

794
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You use

795
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Describe it in math

796
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Describe what it is

797
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I have n users

798
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
This n

799
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
N

800
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Every user

801
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
He has m things

802
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You can choose, right

803
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I have a movie, I have a database

804
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Then every user can choose

805
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
All the movies in this database

806
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Uh

807
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You can put this thing

808
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Think of it as a big evidence

809
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This evidence is really big because

810
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
For example, I have a million movies

811
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So my m is

812
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
1 million

813
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
If I say 1 million users

814
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Then my evidence is 1 million times

815
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Such a big size

816
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Of course, usually

817
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Most of the entries are empty

818
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Because you can't say 1 million movies

819
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
All finished

820
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So you can only watch

821
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
For example, 10,000 movies

822
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So this rank is very important

823
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Most of this matrix

824
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Uh, the rank is very low

825
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What about the recommendation system

826
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What is this algorithm basically doing

827
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He just wants to reconstruct

828
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
This matrix

829
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I already chose some elements

830
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Then I want to be on you

831
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I want to reconstruct other places

832
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
This is what the recommendation system does

833
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then this place is very interesting

834
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
In 2017

835
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What about us

836
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Uh, in this quantum information

837
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Quantum machine learning

838
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Uh, where

839
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
They sent a big message

840
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
They have a algorithm now

841
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Just need

842
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Log m n so much

843
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is very impressive

844
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Why

845
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because before this algorithm

846
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
All classic

847
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Do recommendation system

848
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Algorithm

849
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
All need at least

850
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Polynomial

851
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
In m and n

852
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So you can see this quantum algorithm

853
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There is an increase in the number of points

854
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Right, this recommendation system

855
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is a very important algorithm

856
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Because all your online shopping

857
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
As long as it is related to online

858
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Maybe this

859
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Uh, this

860
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What are they advertising

861
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Also have this recommendation system

862
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Build in

863
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That is to say, everyone felt at that time

864
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Quantum algorithm is very useful

865
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Uh, but

866
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This year in 2018

867
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There is a student in Texas

868
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It seems to be

869
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Scott Aaronson

870
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's not a student

871
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's like a specialty

872
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This kind of student

873
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He should be only 18 years old

874
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Uh

875
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
He just

876
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He read this quantum algorithm paper

877
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Found it

878
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What about this quantum algorithm paper

879
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
In fact, this quantum algorithm paper

880
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's actually not entirely

881
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Classic recommendation system

882
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
With classic recommendation system

883
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Basically not doing the same thing

884
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's actually just estimating this

885
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Uh, this is inside

886
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The most likely

887
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Entry

888
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
This low probability entry

889
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Basically, you don't need to reconstruct

890
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What about their quantum algorithm

891
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Do it like this

892
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Quantum algorithm

893
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Can go to

894
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
These high probability values

895
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Then the second

896
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You don't need to reconstruct the whole

897
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
All elements

898
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So this will have this index

899
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That's it

900
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This 18-year-old

901
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He actually

902
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What about this quantum idea

903
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He found this

904
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Sampling can be done

905
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That is, in 2018, this is about a few months ago

906
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh, no, it's July

907
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Uh

908
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
He also uses a

909
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Classic algorithm can do exactly the same

910
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Uh, this

911
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Efficiency

912
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So in the recommendation system

913
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This quantum algorithm is completely

914
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
No acceleration, it's the same as the classic algorithm

915
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's exactly the same

916
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But this is another interesting place

917
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That is, in this quantum information and quantum computation

918
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What about

919
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
No matter what field you are in, you can come in

920
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You have classical knowledge

921
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You can take your classical knowledge

922
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
To improve your

923
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Classical algorithm

924
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Uh, and then you

925
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You're starting on both sides

926
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's kind of like a competition

927
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Keep pushing the algorithm on both sides

928
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The efficiency keeps going up

929
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
This is a very interesting result

930
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So good

931
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Uh, and then

932
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Uh, because I've been doing some of this lately

933
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
This aspect of work

934
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So I took this opportunity

935
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Uh, this opportunity

936
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I also told you

937
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm wearing

938
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The place

939
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What kind of questions did this place have just now

940
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Next is that I want to introduce

941
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
My my

942
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Some of the results on this quantum machine learning

943
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Is there a problem

944
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It seems like

945
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Some people want to ask questions

946
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But that one

947
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
There's a jump

948
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, really? I didn't notice

949
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Good good

950
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Now we're going to

951
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Because it's another one

952
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's more like my topic

953
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
We can pause a little bit

954
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Let everyone ask

955
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
These algorithms

956
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hello

957
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My question is

958
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That is

959
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Maybe in the short term

960
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
We might just

961
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Rely on dozens of qubits

962
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Or I don't know

963
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Something like 100 qubits

964
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
For this kind of really

965
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Strong is really

966
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
These

967
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
For example, like recommendation system

968
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
This kind of thing

969
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Is there a way to do this

970
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Or a few hundred qubits

971
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Test

972
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Uh

973
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Uh

974
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This may not be

975
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But your question is very good

976
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Because my next report is basically

977
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Focus on this question

978
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So that's it

979
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We

980
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What I do with my students

981
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Now this

982
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hardware development

983
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Can do this

984
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That is to say, we need this

985
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The circuit size is actually very small

986
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'll give you one later

987
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This is a more specific number

988
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Good good

989
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Thank you

990
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Because of these

991
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Most of the algorithms

992
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
All

993
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I need a bigger scale

994
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
This quantum computer can do

995
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
A negative quantum computer

996
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That is to say

997
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Uh he can't

998
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Just a small device

999
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You can do these things

1000
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Right

1001
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I also want to ask you

1002
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Is the circuit size talking about the circuit depth?

1003
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You can do a few gates

1004
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This thing

1005
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
There are still others

1006
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Or qubit size

1007
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Or circuit depth

1008
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'll give you one later

1009
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
My example is

1010
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You will see later

1011
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
How many qubits do you need

1012
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
How many gates do you need

1013
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Any other questions

1014
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Can you hear that

1015
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Can

1016
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let me introduce myself

1017
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Sorry

1018
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I am that Guo Enrui

1019
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Now in

1020
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
University of Maryland

1021
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hello

1022
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Just like me

1023
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
As far as I know

1024
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
For example, like Shor's algorithm

1025
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It has exponential acceleration

1026
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then like Gravel's search

1027
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
At least

1028
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Even if

1029
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
At least you can reach the square root of n

1030
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I want to ask

1031
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now everyone is mainly doing quantum algorithms

1032
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Is studying quantum algorithms

1033
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
In different

1034
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Different aspects

1035
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Expansion of different problems

1036
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That is, now everyone is mainly studying

1037
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
In this

1038
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Part of the algorithm

1039
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Right algorithm

1040
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Actually from

1041
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
From this 1980s

1042
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That one

1043
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Everyone started to think

1044
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Should it be possible to have a quantum computer

1045
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Do some

1046
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That's the one

1047
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
He mentioned that maybe we can

1048
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Can have a quantum device to do the operation

1049
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
From that time on

1050
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Quantum algorithm is a very, very

1051
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Important topic

1052
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Its influence is basically

1053
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Very comprehensive

1054
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
For example, we know

1055
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
In this crypto

1056
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
In the early days, we were very focused on

1057
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
This cryptography

1058
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Cryptography basically has some

1059
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Assumption of computation

1060
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Right, that is, I want to assume

1061
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What kind of problem

1062
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Not good

1063
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Then

1064
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That

1065
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
This is the assumption of computation

1066
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Many places may

1067
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It means that if you say there is a good one

1068
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You have a good quantum algorithm

1069
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Your assumption of computation is not true

1070
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Not established

1071
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The most classic is this rsa

1072
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Because it assumes this

1073
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Prime number is

1074
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's not easy to be affected

1075
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's not easy to find its

1076
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The value factor

1077
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That's why it's so famous

1078
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Another reason

1079
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So

1080
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You design a good quantum algorithm

1081
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You may be able to break a lot

1082
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
A lot of things

1083
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This is why the quantum algorithm is very important

1084
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
A reason

1085
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Thank you

1086
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Thank you

1087
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That

1088
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'll continue

1089
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We'll have one last time

1090
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Q&A, you can ask any questions

1091
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Okay, that's it

1092
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
University of Sydney

1093
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm from the University of Sydney

1094
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I happen to be with

1095
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The last author

1096
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Tao Dacheng

1097
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
In this classical machine learning

1098
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Is a very famous person

1099
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
This group

1100
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
He is also interested in this machine learning

1101
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Quantum machine learning is very interesting

1102
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So I took his students

1103
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The first author is his student

1104
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
From the University of Sydney

1105
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Our paper

1106
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Just put it on the archive a few days ago

1107
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Just put it on the archive in September

1108
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We basically

1109
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The idea is basically

1110
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Combine some classical

1111
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Classical machine learning

1112
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Then combine some

1113
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Quantum algorithm

1114
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The idea

1115
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Then our

1116
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Our target is that we can

1117
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Now this hardware

1118
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We can do this

1119
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Proposal like this

1120
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Okay, that's the first one

1121
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Let me do a little background introduction

1122
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I just introduced global search

1123
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Right global search

1124
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It can be used basically

1125
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Machine learning to implement

1126
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
How to implement

1127
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Basically global search has to do one thing

1128
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What is it

1129
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I want to find a state

1130
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This size, this file, this state

1131
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Let it get closer

1132
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Omega is the direction I want

1133
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I want him to get closer to Omega

1134
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The better

1135
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I just want to

1136
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Basically, this is me

1137
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I am doing this place

1138
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What are you doing

1139
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I want to

1140
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The closer he gets to Omega, the better

1141
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I want him

1142
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The less part perpendicular to Omega

1143
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Right, this is basically

1144
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
What is this equation doing

1145
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Then we just said

1146
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's why we can

1147
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
We can come and learn this

1148
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This state

1149
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
We just use

1150
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We use circuit to learn him

1151
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Because just that global

1152
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The algorithm is that I have two operations

1153
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm just going to flip it, right

1154
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Keep doing it and then flip it to a certain state

1155
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Just say about n

1156
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This is probably this

1157
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This step

1158
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I can flip it to the state I want

1159
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Right

1160
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Then this variational

1161
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This idea is basically

1162
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Anyway, I'm going to find a state

1163
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The closer to this

1164
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Omega is better, right?

1165
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I just want to

1166
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can use machine learning to recognize this state

1167
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Right, this is also this

1168
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Biomonte

1169
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
This nature just wrote that nature

1170
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Review article

1171
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
A thought from their group

1172
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
This is also a paper in May

1173
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This development is very fast

1174
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Then he went to recognize this

1175
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Recognize this circuit

1176
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
How does he recognize it?

1177
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Hey, I designed two operations

1178
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
One of them is this P Omega

1179
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
This operation is what I just had in that slide

1180
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And then another PS is just

1181
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That is to say, there are two at the beginning

1182
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This flip operation

1183
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
One is Omega and the other is S

1184
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's not exactly

1185
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Do P Omega and PS

1186
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
He can do P Omega again

1187
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Give him an alpha angle

1188
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Give him a beta angle

1189
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What about the angle of this beta

1190
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
This can be used

1191
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This can be used

1192
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Optimization

1193
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
To update your alpha and beta

1194
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Right

1195
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We are doing

1196
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
We can all use some mms

1197
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Right to do this

1198
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
To do update

1199
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then he is to update this alpha and beta

1200
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Angle to let you next round

1201
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Your alpha and beta angles are different

1202
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Right then

1203
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Then they thought

1204
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Hey, if I use this machine

1205
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What about the method of learning

1206
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
What is the comparison with Global Search

1207
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Very interesting, look at the next picture

1208
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is their numerical experiment

1209
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They just used four cubits

1210
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I used four cubits here

1211
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And then

1212
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And then this blue dot

1213
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's called Global Search

1214
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Global Search means

1215
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We just said you need to flip, right

1216
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You need this

1217
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Omega and S do a round like this

1218
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Right

1219
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Is this a round

1220
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
One round is two steps, right

1221
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then you need to do a few rounds

1222
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This Global Search probably tells you

1223
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Probably four rounds

1224
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Is eight operations

1225
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
In fact, it is

1226
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
2n plus 1, so it should be nine

1227
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Right

1228
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Nine words

1229
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Look at this

1230
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Horizontal

1231
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
X-axis, you will find

1232
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Several times

1233
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
This point is done nine times

1234
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Global Search

1235
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It can get the biggest

1236
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The biggest chance you see is 1

1237
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You see you are in this Oracle P

1238
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This is equal to 9

1239
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Your chance is 1, right

1240
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This means that Global Search

1241
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
At this point, you can get the biggest chance

1242
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And then at other points

1243
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You see this probability is fluctuating

1244
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Right, it's actually like this

1245
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Up and down, right, it's only in

1246
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The probability is the biggest

1247
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And then in this part of the red cross

1248
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
They got it by machine learning

1249
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Very interesting

1250
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
At nine

1251
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It can be the same as Global Search

1252
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
The result

1253
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But in other places

1254
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It can be better than Global Search

1255
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's more robust

1256
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That is to say

1257
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You won't be because of yours

1258
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
For example, I was supposed to be in the nine

1259
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm going to stop

1260
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But I stopped early

1261
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
For example, I stopped at 8

1262
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm this up and down

1263
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I did it eight times

1264
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What if you use Variation

1265
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It will be better, right

1266
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It will be robust to your system design

1267
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
What about this idea

1268
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That is to say, we

1269
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We want to say that this idea

1270
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Perception

1271
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Perception is basically

1272
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
That is to say, you are also going to search

1273
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So basically you can put this

1274
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Global Search Embedded in your Perception

1275
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You just have to identify you

1276
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Mislabeled this value

1277
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Right, that is to say

1278
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That is to say, we

1279
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Use this idea

1280
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This is our step

1281
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Give me a database

1282
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
This database

1283
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I have so many points

1284
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
i from 1 to n

1285
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I have so many points

1286
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Then every point of mine

1287
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Xi is my input

1288
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Every point of mine

1289
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I have m so many features

1290
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I just want to go from feature

1291
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
To identify my

1292
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
To identify my label

1293
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
This yi is my label

1294
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It may be positive or negative

1295
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Then, of course, the first step

1296
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I want to put this classical data

1297
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Encode to a quantum state

1298
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What about this quantum state

1299
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What do we do

1300
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That is to say, I put this feature

1301
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I put this

1302
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Xi

1303
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Encode to my input

1304
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Then

1305
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Then I have another

1306
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This index register

1307
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I just came to keep track

1308
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I have a few

1309
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
A few samples

1310
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
This i this place

1311
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I just need to say I have n

1312
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
N so many

1313
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I need to log n

1314
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Because

1315
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Because you know

1316
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Quantum state can be superposition

1317
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So I just need to log n so many

1318
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I can keep track

1319
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
This n

1320
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
This n

1321
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Such a big data

1322
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Data set

1323
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The same

1324
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If I say there are m features

1325
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
This feature register

1326
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I just need to log n so many

1327
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That is to say, it actually has a

1328
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Index compression

1329
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Of course, this step is actually

1330
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'll tell you from the beginning

1331
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It actually needs a

1332
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
A more non-trivial algorithm

1333
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But I'll come back to this issue later

1334
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Uh, and then

1335
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The first step is to say

1336
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'm going to do this UK operation

1337
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
What about this UK operation

1338
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
What am I going to do

1339
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I want to identify this K

1340
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Basically, this

1341
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
My state basically means

1342
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
My K

1343
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Has been mislabeled

1344
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So I'm going to mislabel

1345
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
This place introduces a

1346
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Face

1347
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
What about this UK

1348
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I want to do this thing

1349
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But what about me

1350
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm going to design a

1351
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Learning algorithm, I'm going to learn

1352
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to

1353
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Approximate this UK

1354
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
With this

1355
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
With this low depth

1356
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Quantum circuit

1357
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Approximate UK and then achieve this

1358
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Basically this is

1359
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And then

1360
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Because this is different from global search

1361
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Because we have feature register

1362
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
With index register

1363
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Feature register is for you

1364
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
To recognize your

1365
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
What does your distribution look like

1366
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Right?

1367
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
There is no feature

1368
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You just need to do your index register

1369
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Right?

1370
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But because

1371
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
We're in front of this

1372
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Because you're done

1373
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
This

1374
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Give you this

1375
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Add a face

1376
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Because he actually

1377
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
With this index

1378
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
He actually has one

1379
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
These two registers

1380
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It actually exists

1381
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You do the operation for K

1382
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You will affect you

1383
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Feature this register

1384
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So we need to do one more step

1385
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
We need to do this step

1386
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
We need to put the feature

1387
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This register

1388
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
With your index register

1389
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Disentangle it

1390
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So you see this is now

1391
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It means that there is no correlation in the middle

1392
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
There is no correlation

1393
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That is, we

1394
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
What about our circuit

1395
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Disentangle

1396
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This operation

1397
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
These two operations

1398
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
We're going to use the method of machine learning

1399
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And then

1400
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Basically, this is my two

1401
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Basic operation

1402
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
This picture is a demo

1403
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
This ul1 is what I just did

1404
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And then, no, ul1

1405
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Plus this control g

1406
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Basically, this is what I just did

1407
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And then

1408
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
This ul1

1409
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
In fact, because this is just learning

1410
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Your feature, so it's just in this feature

1411
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Register

1412
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Disentangle can also be used

1413
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
In this feature register

1414
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And then disentangle

1415
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
This unit

1416
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This is basically just

1417
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The second inversion of this global search

1418
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
For this s

1419
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
An inversion of this plane

1420
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
What about this inversion

1421
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Because it's going to do an inversion of your index

1422
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So it's just an index register

1423
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
This is a

1424
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This is a

1425
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
An iteration

1426
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Then I need a total of about

1427
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
All n so many iterations

1428
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And then you'll find

1429
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's what we're actually doing here

1430
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This quantum

1431
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Quantum state

1432
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This quantum circuit

1433
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I use this classical

1434
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Optimization to do

1435
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Just like this variation of global search

1436
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It actually has an angle that can be controlled

1437
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm using classical

1438
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
To do optimization

1439
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That is to say, there are some MMD

1440
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
This is more

1441
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Anyway, this is some classical optimization

1442
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Machine learning often does some things

1443
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Then I update and do it again

1444
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I've been doing square root n so many times

1445
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Ah

1446
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Just like global search

1447
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Square root n so many times

1448
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I can adjust it to the angle I want

1449
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Like this

1450
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This is our

1451
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Simple experiment

1452
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Then we can

1453
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We use experiments to implement

1454
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That

1455
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
What about this place

1456
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I

1457
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Ah

1458
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Say

1459
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Inside this square

1460
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I told you that every one of me

1461
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Every one of this

1462
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
How big is this

1463
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Our circuit

1464
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's probably three

1465
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Three three three

1466
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Three layers like this

1467
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Or five layers

1468
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Because of our

1469
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Our

1470
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Feature is probably

1471
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Just

1472
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Our example

1473
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's actually quite small

1474
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
We'll have a bigger example later

1475
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Our feature size is probably

1476
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Four

1477
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There are four features in each sample

1478
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Then you will find

1479
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
My success probability

1480
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Can be up to

1481
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
About 80%

1482
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Ah

1483
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The one on the left is this

1484
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You identify your

1485
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Mislabel index

1486
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This probability

1487
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
The error rate is probably

1488
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It can be up to 80%

1489
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
90% like this

1490
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Classification

1491
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This place

1492
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Then

1493
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Perception can only do this

1494
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Linear partition

1495
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What if we want to

1496
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
How do we do it

1497
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
We just have to combine these

1498
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Perception

1499
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I don't know if there is

1500
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Is there any of this

1501
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
More familiar with machine learning

1502
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We are

1503
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
There is one called Ensemble Learning

1504
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Basically the idea is

1505
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I have a big

1506
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Ah database

1507
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I have a bigger sample

1508
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't need to

1509
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I don't need to use this whole sample

1510
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
What can I do

1511
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I can

1512
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I can sample from the inside

1513
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Some smaller data

1514
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Then I use these smaller data

1515
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Set to train

1516
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
My perception

1517
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Then I use my

1518
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
A few weaker perceptions

1519
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I can combine it into one

1520
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Strong perception

1521
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This idea is called

1522
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
This is the idea of ​​Ensemble Learning

1523
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Then

1524
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Doing this is sub-sampling

1525
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Because I don't need to

1526
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Such a big database

1527
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I just sample some smaller data

1528
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
This is the concept of sub-sampling

1529
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So if I say I can train

1530
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
My capital T

1531
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Then I can

1532
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
This yt

1533
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Is the outcome of each vt

1534
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Then my ct

1535
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Is my preset threshold

1536
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Then I can use this thing

1537
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
To do a better

1538
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
This

1539
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Ah

1540
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Then we want to know

1541
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Will this combine be better than

1542
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
My weak

1543
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Right

1544
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Then we will do a numerical

1545
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Conclusion

1546
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What are the benefits of this

1547
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It can

1548
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You can put your bigger

1549
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Training set to break it down into

1550
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Smaller training set

1551
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Then you train this weak classifier

1552
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Then this just fits

1553
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
This quantum machine learning now

1554
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Because we mentioned at the beginning

1555
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What is the bottleneck of quantum machine learning

1556
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
What is it

1557
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Classical data

1558
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Quantum state

1559
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
This is almost all

1560
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Quantum machine learning proposal

1561
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Then we use

1562
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The idea of sub-sampling

1563
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
The idea of ensemble learning

1564
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
We can overcome this problem

1565
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Because you are actually a small data set

1566
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You are still quite efficient

1567
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You don't need to say

1568
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I have a hundred thousand points

1569
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
With me a

1570
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This complexity

1571
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's not just a hundred thousand

1572
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Divided by one hundred so much

1573
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's actually every step

1574
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
After the complexity you need

1575
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The complexity is multiplied by the index

1576
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So we use

1577
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
This concept is actually very

1578
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Very fit for now

1579
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The development of quantum hardware

1580
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Good

1581
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Then

1582
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Next is a more

1583
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
One of CS

1584
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We want to characterize our efficiency

1585
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
If we say every data set

1586
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Every data set

1587
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because we want to train some

1588
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Weak classifier

1589
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
If I say

1590
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Log square root n so many points

1591
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Then we

1592
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Query complexity

1593
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
This capital T means that I have a few

1594
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I have a total

1595
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Weak classifier number is

1596
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This capital T so many

1597
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Then you will find that because it is actually

1598
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Still related to this global algorithm

1599
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So it is with you

1600
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
This square root of the data set

1601
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So if you say it's log n

1602
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Square root is probably

1603
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Multiply by this quantity

1604
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
This m is the size of your feature

1605
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
This is related to me

1606
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
How many steps do you need to do

1607
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
How many steps do you need to do

1608
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Then this is probably

1609
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Heuristic is probably

1610
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Log n so many steps

1611
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We will demonstrate later

1612
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
If I say I choose log n

1613
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So many classical optimization

1614
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Then every data set of mine

1615
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'll have one later

1616
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Performance comparison

1617
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Run time is probably

1618
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
With log n

1619
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Multiply this

1620
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Polynomial relationship

1621
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So basically it is very efficient

1622
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
it is good

1623
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
it is good

1624
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
This is our

1625
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
A practical example we run

1626
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
A classical database

1627
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Tens of thousands of points

1628
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
10,000 points

1629
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then every point

1630
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
This feature is four

1631
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Is four features

1632
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Can be encoded on two qubits

1633
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Then we sub-sampling

1634
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
We just sample

1635
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
We just make it a sample of four smaller databases

1636
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Then every database

1637
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Only eight points

1638
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So this ratio is very small

1639
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's about 8 out of 10,000

1640
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Then we found that if you use 8 out of 10,000

1641
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You can follow

1642
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You can get it directly from this

1643
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
From this 10,000 points

1644
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
To train

1645
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Your perception

1646
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Your combined efficiency is basically

1647
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
With you

1648
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
10,000 points to do the same

1649
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So you look at the last of this table

1650
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
The last column

1651
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The last column means that I have combined

1652
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I have four

1653
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
This week

1654
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
This week's perception

1655
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
This is my last combined success probability

1656
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You will find that it is

1657
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It can be up to about 80%

1658
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Of course with

1659
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It's not so good

1660
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But

1661
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Hardware can be implemented now

1662
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Basically this is already a very

1663
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Very

1664
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Very good proposal because it is now

1665
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Hardware can also be implemented

1666
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Ah

1667
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
This is my example

1668
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Ah oh yes

1669
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
This place

1670
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
There is a caveat

1671
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
This is

1672
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
We

1673
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
We can also another one

1674
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
If you say you have a way to let you

1675
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Ah sample

1676
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Ah this data set

1677
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
If you say your subsampling

1678
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You can sample away

1679
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
From this

1680
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Perception of each week

1681
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Because perception is basically

1682
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Classify left or classify right

1683
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
If you say your sample

1684
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
When you do subsampling

1685
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You can avoid this

1686
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
These points

1687
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
This probability can also be increased to 92%

1688
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Say this depends on you

1689
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
This method of subsampling

1690
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
At the most

1691
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Say at the most extreme

1692
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If you say even if you use uniform sampling

1693
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Then we can still get 80%

1694
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
If you say your sampling you can adjust

1695
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You can get 9 times 2

1696
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
9 times 2 is already very impressive

1697
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I think so

1698
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't know his community

1699
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Reason

1700
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I think his community can do very well

1701
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So at least in the quantum community

1702
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
No one can do it like us

1703
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So good

1704
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
This place is just that

1705
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Ah

1706
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The question asked by the agent is

1707
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
How many operations do we need

1708
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
In the numerical experiment we just did

1709
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
We actually use that regated

1710
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Cloud platform they have a library

1711
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Then we implement

1712
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
We all use his standard library

1713
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
If they want they can take our code

1714
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Can compile to their

1715
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
This circuit can be run like this

1716
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Then

1717
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
We say that in encoding

1718
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We want to put classical map to quantum state

1719
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
If you use subsampling you only need to use

1720
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
29 operations

1721
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Probably use 29 operations

1722
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Then this is all from him

1723
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
That's what I just said

1724
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
You use their library

1725
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You can

1726
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
After you input the database

1727
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
He will tell you your

1728
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
How many gates do you need

1729
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So we

1730
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Input it about 29

1731
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
On average 29

1732
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Then the operations behind us

1733
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Don't we have a few operations

1734
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That is, you have to flip your face

1735
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And then you have to disentangle

1736
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Right then

1737
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
What about the operation we need in total

1738
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Ah

1739
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That's what we need

1740
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
About 36

1741
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Can control your angle

1742
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Then

1743
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Then

1744
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Then

1745
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Then

1746
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Then

1747
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You can

1748
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So if you say

1749
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Decomposing

1750
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We probably need a total of 146

1751
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Jingle with

1752
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You can do our experiment

1753
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Like this

1754
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay, this is probably the details of our experiment

1755
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Then

1756
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Well, this one after this

1757
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The latter is more complicated

1758
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I won't talk about it first

1759
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Anyway, when the time comes, everyone has an opinion

1760
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Maybe I can come back later

1761
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Give other talk like this

1762
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Okay, I don't know

1763
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Do you have any questions

1764
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Like this

1765
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Thank you

1766
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Hello

1767
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Can you ask a question

1768
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Related to your talk

1769
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Okay, no problem

1770
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Because you mentioned it at the beginning

1771
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Let me introduce myself first

1772
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
My name is Chen Yuan, I am a fourth grade

1773
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Then

1774
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You mentioned that Taiwan is planning

1775
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Want to

1776
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It's also related to computation

1777
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
This is more famous

1778
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Like Microsoft

1779
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Should be

1780
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Or google

1781
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Buy john martini's lab

1782
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That Taiwan

1783
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Have decided to use

1784
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Which one

1785
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Which direction

1786
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
To do

1787
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This is a good question

1788
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Basically

1789
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Taiwan's tendency is more

1790
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It should be said that the high-level

1791
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Government technology minister

1792
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Their tendency is more

1793
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Hope to use semiconductor

1794
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yes, the semiconductor

1795
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The big company has not yet invested

1796
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I can't say that either

1797
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
The big company is now

1798
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It may have a main force

1799
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But he didn't give up

1800
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Other proposals

1801
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
The best semiconductor is Australia

1802
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Australia

1803
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
University of New South Wales

1804
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
University of New South Wales

1805
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
They are leading the world

1806
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Semiconductor technology

1807
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Their Qubit is using

1808
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Semiconductor process

1809
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So then

1810
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Taiwan has TSMC

1811
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Everyone still hopes to use semiconductor

1812
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So the government department technology department

1813
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Preferred approach is also

1814
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Semiconductor

1815
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Then Taiwan University

1816
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Now it is said that the Taiwan University of Physics

1817
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Then with the Taiwan University of Electrical Engineering

1818
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Li Junyun

1819
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
With

1820
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Teacher Chen Shiyuan

1821
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They are now saying that they have

1822
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
A team is now

1823
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Follow is to say that they want to

1824
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Mainly to work with

1825
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Cooperate with University of New South Wales

1826
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They want to develop semiconductor technology

1827
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Then now this Tsinghua University

1828
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This research center

1829
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Inside a

1830
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Project to do superconductivity

1831
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
In fact, the Central Academy of Sciences has a teacher doing superconductivity

1832
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Qubit

1833
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So

1834
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
In this Tsinghua University

1835
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There are people doing superconductivity experiments

1836
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Of course there is also light and snow

1837
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
There is also a group of people doing light and snow

1838
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Qubit

1839
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Light and snow, of course, also need

1840
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Sorry

1841
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Sorry

1842
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I just want to ask if this is in the field

1843
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Generally speaking, which direction

1844
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Is the most likely to be done

1845
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The most robust and then the easiest

1846
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Large-scale production

1847
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It's not easy

1848
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Because these are all super low temperatures

1849
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Superconductivity now needs

1850
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Hundreds of

1851
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Mini-K

1852
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It's almost absolute zero

1853
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Then semiconductor

1854
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Can go to

1855
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Maybe

1856
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Around 4K

1857
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Now

1858
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Large-scale is almost

1859
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
At present

1860
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
No idea

1861
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It's not like our computer can be at room temperature

1862
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
These devices all need a

1863
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
A big refrigerator

1864
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Cool it down to almost zero

1865
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Absolute zero

1866
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So

1867
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
At present, everyone's business model

1868
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's still more like crowd computing

1869
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
For example, they said

1870
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Regetti IBM

1871
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Or Microsoft, they are basically

1872
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
The future trend is that I have one

1873
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Is cloud

1874
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Then let you access

1875
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You can have some more complicated

1876
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You can upload it to my server

1877
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Then my quantum computer will help you calculate

1878
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
The current business model is like this

1879
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Thank you

1880
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I thought

1881
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Most of the people in Caltech

1882
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Are doing theory

1883
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Caltech is now doing experiments

1884
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Which direction

1885
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Caltech itself

1886
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It doesn't seem to be experimenting with quantum computation

1887
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
We have an institution called IQIM

1888
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
This is quantum information

1889
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It's called

1890
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's called

1891
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's all theory

1892
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
The group of people

1893
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yes

1894
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Let me add that I am now a graduate of Dongda

1895
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What we do here is

1896
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Just the semiconductor

1897
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
How to make a semiconductor

1898
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
To do Qubit

1899
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's true

1900
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
New South Wales

1901
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Very leading

1902
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Especially recently

1903
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
From the end of last year

1904
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
About 80 million

1905
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Establish a new company

1906
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And their country's funds

1907
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Invest in this area

1908
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That 80 million is US dollars

1909
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
That's right

1910
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So I think

1911
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
All directions are

1912
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Very difficult

1913
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I was before

1914
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
When I was in PhD

1915
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Also use

1916
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But

1917
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
My personal idea is

1918
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's not that easy

1919
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
He's probably

1920
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
A bottleneck

1921
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't know yet

1922
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
How to overcome

1923
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Yes, but because I do experiments

1924
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So if

1925
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
If you want to discuss

1926
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Let's continue to discuss

1927
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But for now

1928
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
For the content of today's speech

1929
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Is there a problem

1930
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Yes, I want to remind you

1931
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
If you want to see that

1932
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Senior's video

1933
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I have a link below

1934
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
That link

1935
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
If you want to find

1936
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
If you don't know the problem

1937
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You can click on the link

1938
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
In the chat

1939
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There is a link

1940
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
My slides are all online

1941
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So you can watch it anytime

1942
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It will always be there

1943
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I have a question

1944
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Sorry

1945
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
My question

1946
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I remember

1947
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I'm watching now

1948
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Because I'm not doing theory

1949
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But I know

1950
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It seems to be in the algorithm

1951
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
For

1952
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
If you don't know how to deal with it

1953
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
At least there is

1954
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Grover

1955
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
To do a basic acceleration

1956
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But we want

1957
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
What you want

1958
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Things should be

1959
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Want to do

1960
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Not just polynomial

1961
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But exponential acceleration

1962
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So inside

1963
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Inside

1964
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Several algorithms

1965
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Recommendation now

1966
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I saw it before

1967
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Austin

1968
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
This news

1969
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I think it's super cool

1970
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Found

1971
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Is a

1972
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I thought only quantum computers could do it

1973
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Found out

1974
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Can be done

1975
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
What do they call it

1976
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Quantum Inspired Algorithm

1977
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I think it's really cool

1978
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Can I make a comment

1979
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yes

1980
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
This is basically

1981
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
If you say now

1982
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Strict

1983
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Complexity Theory

1984
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
For those who do theoretical computer science

1985
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
They actually mean

1986
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You can't define it yet

1987
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Quantum Computation

1988
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Really

1989
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Really

1990
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Very strict proof of acceleration

1991
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Even like Grover

1992
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Even like this Schultz Algorithm

1993
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
We know he has it now

1994
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
He now has this

1995
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But it's just

1996
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The best classic algorithm

1997
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Then we know

1998
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
What about this factoring

1999
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
He is not a

2000
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
He is a question of mouth NP

2001
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
He said

2002
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Not to say

2003
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Ah

2004
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It should be said that the current bottleneck is

2005
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Classical may

2006
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't know how to do it

2007
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Maybe one day there will be one

2008
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
There is also a Schultz algorithm

2009
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
This classical algorithm

2010
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Schultz Algorithm

2011
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yes

2012
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Because of Complexity Class

2013
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Not to say this

2014
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Factoring is the most difficult problem

2015
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
He is not a question of NP

2016
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
He is not a question of NP

2017
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
So

2018
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's all like this now

2019
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Although we have some

2020
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Some

2021
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Quantum algorithms are better than modern classic algorithms

2022
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
But the point is

2023
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
This is to say

2024
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
There will be a classic algorithm

2025
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Will improve

2026
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
This is also

2027
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Very interesting

2028
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I also encourage if

2029
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
People who do CS

2030
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You should be able to say

2031
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Bring your classical knowledge

2032
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Let's take a look at these quantum algorithms

2033
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Or

2034
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Or to discuss

2035
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
You are interested in the corresponding quantum version

2036
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Maybe it's like this

2037
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Maybe one day you can also

2038
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
A very good way

2039
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
This way

2040
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yes

2041
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Do you have any questions?

2042
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Please say

2043
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I want to ask you again

2044
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
At the beginning of your quantum

2045
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Principle Component Analysis

2046
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Is it the HHL algorithm?

2047
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Or later

2048
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
There are other extensions

2049
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Uh

2050
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It is possible

2051
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It is possible to use this HHL

2052
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
But I didn't go to see it

2053
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Because I just entered this field

2054
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Not long

2055
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Basically this principle component

2056
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It is definitely a face estimation

2057
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Because

2058
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Basically it is to identify these

2059
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
The covariance matrix is relatively large

2060
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
This eigenvalue

2061
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Maybe you can put HHL

2062
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Do it like this

2063
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Hello i have a question

2064
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Ok you ask

2065
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Self-introduction

2066
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Uh

2067
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Uh

2068
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I did a high-performance experiment

2069
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Is

2070
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I am doing dark matter

2071
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But because I did

2072
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Is actually with

2073
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Very close

2074
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So when I was in college

2075
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I went to the teacher's class

2076
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I almost did it

2077
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
My question is like this

2078
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Uh actually

2079
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You just

2080
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Is what you said

2081
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
In fact, it is more like

2082
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Is there

2083
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Strict mathematical logic

2084
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Machine learning

2085
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But now the most powerful machine learning is some kind of fossil logic

2086
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Neural net

2087
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Now quantum

2088
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Everyone is in this direction

2089
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Use quantum to do fossil logic

2090
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
What is the situation now

2091
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Will be

2092
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Traditionally more powerful

2093
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Still don't know

2094
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Because I don't know

2095
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I don't know

2096
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Ok ok

2097
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Since you ask these questions

2098
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I will continue to talk about it

2099
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
In fact, one of the results behind me

2100
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
In fact, it may be related to this

2101
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
That is to say

2102
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Can everyone see it

2103
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Can see

2104
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Basically

2105
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Me and my student

2106
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The question we want to ask is

2107
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Because you know that we actually use this

2108
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Circuit to learn

2109
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You are actually your quantum circuit

2110
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You have a parameter in it

2111
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Then you can use this optimization

2112
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
To adjust your parameters to produce the state you want

2113
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Right

2114
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
There is a question that you want to know

2115
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Such a quantum circuit

2116
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
We call parametric quantum circuit

2117
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
His

2118
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Expressive power because we know

2119
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Machine learning has two types, one is classification

2120
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
One is generative model

2121
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That is to say, I want to produce a distribution

2122
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I want to produce a target distribution

2123
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Then we want to know this quantum circuit

2124
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
This

2125
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The ability to generate this

2126
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Generative ability is how good

2127
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Right

2128
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So I did it with my student

2129
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Did the following thing

2130
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That is to say

2131
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
If I say I can have

2132
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
L block

2133
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
This every

2134
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
A block of this square

2135
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Then

2136
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
In fact, the last row

2137
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Is measurement

2138
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
After measurement, it is a classical data

2139
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Then I can put this

2140
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Do some classical optimization

2141
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Put this

2142
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Parameter feedback

2143
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Because this is all adjustable

2144
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Adjustable parameters

2145
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Then I want to know

2146
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
This type of circuit

2147
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I finally generated these classical distributions

2148
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
With

2149
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
We know that the Boltzmann machine

2150
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Can also be used to generate distributions

2151
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Right

2152
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You just mentioned these like this neural network

2153
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Basically, the Boltzmann machine is like this

2154
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That is to say, the most general Boltzmann machine

2155
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
The picture in the middle

2156
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
That is to say, it has a visible layer and a hidden layer

2157
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Then all the layers are fully connected

2158
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Right

2159
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Then we all know that this kind of fully connected

2160
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Very powerful

2161
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
This is basically Deep Neural Network

2162
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Everything is connected

2163
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Then

2164
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Of course there is another type of Boltzmann machine

2165
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That is to say, it is actually

2166
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It only has layers and layers

2167
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Connected

2168
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Every

2169
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
The middle of your own layer is not

2170
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
This is not connected

2171
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Right, this is Restricted Boltzmann Machine

2172
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
These two are classic methods

2173
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Can be generated

2174
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Then the picture on my left

2175
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
That is to say this is

2176
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Another version of this picture

2177
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
That is to say

2178
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The layout of each block of the circuit is different

2179
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I'm on the left

2180
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
The layout of each circuit on the left

2181
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
The layout of each block of the circuit is the same

2182
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
The quantum circuit on my right

2183
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It actually has one

2184
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Its every layout

2185
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
In fact, the first layout is the most powerful

2186
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Because it

2187
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The first one

2188
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
The first one is that it has a lot of C-NOT gates

2189
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Can be connected

2190
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
The second one, it's actually your C-NOT gate

2191
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It's already less

2192
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And it's

2193
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's every block

2194
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Then all the way to the end

2195
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
This

2196
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Connectivity is actually very limited

2197
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Then we want to know

2198
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
These circuit layouts

2199
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
This

2200
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
From the perspective of deep distribution

2201
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Which one is the most powerful

2202
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Just these two quantum

2203
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
With these two classical

2204
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That's basically it

2205
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
The most powerful is the one on the left

2206
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This quantum circuit

2207
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
This quantum circuit

2208
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Each of them is

2209
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
The same layout

2210
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Then each layout actually has this

2211
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It has a C-NOT between any two points

2212
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Can be connected

2213
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This is the most powerful

2214
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's more powerful than the general Boltzmann machine

2215
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
It's more powerful than the general Boltzmann machine

2216
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
In terms of deep

2217
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Distribution

2218
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Then this general Boltzmann machine

2219
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's better than this quantum circuit

2220
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
The ability to generate

2221
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Because this quantum circuit

2222
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
In fact, it

2223
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It's actually more limited

2224
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It's not all

2225
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
All of this

2226
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
There's a connection between the lines

2227
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So the general Boltzmann machine

2228
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Will be stronger than this circuit

2229
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
This circuit will be stronger than this

2230
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Boltzmann machine

2231
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
This is what we haven't published

2232
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
A result of the paper

2233
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Maybe next week it will be put on the archive

2234
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
If all goes well

2235
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
This is

2236
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
On the one hand

2237
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Also answer your question

2238
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
In fact, the quantum circuit

2239
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It's in the perspective of deep distribution

2240
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
It's actually

2241
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Classic

2242
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The classic Boltzmann machine is stronger

2243
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Of course

2244
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Maybe there are some specific tasks

2245
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Now we don't know yet

2246
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
How does the quantum circuit compare with the Boltzmann machine

2247
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This is still unknown

2248
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Senior, can I ask you

2249
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Can you go back to the page above

2250
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
it is good

2251
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Because like this

2252
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
The two pictures above

2253
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Does it really correspond to the physical

2254
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
His connection

2255
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Like this

2256
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It might be

2257
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Near snapper coupling

2258
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
So he can only follow the side

2259
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
He's gonna do a bunch of swaps

2260
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Right, right, right

2261
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The second picture

2262
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It's kind of like

2263
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
With this actual

2264
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Implementation set up

2265
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Consider

2266
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Because there are some set ups

2267
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So in that

2268
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
When you use

2269
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Every one of them

2270
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Like he's doing

2271
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
One swap is three CNOT

2272
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Every CNOT

2273
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
He can now

2274
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
About how much

2275
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Their

2276
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Fidelity is not high

2277
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I heard it's low, but I don't know

2278
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
How much

2279
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I remember the best is only 80%

2280
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
May be worse

2281
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Because he's actually every

2282
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Connectivity between qubits

2283
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Different

2284
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
A little worse

2285
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Because I think the above

2286
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They just got one million

2287
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
One hundred million

2288
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
This investment

2289
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Very powerful

2290
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
They

2291
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
That's pretty important to them

2292
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Because they even

2293
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
They do it themselves

2294
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But I think the above two pictures

2295
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It's like that

2296
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Compared with that

2297
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Really

2298
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Like that

2299
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
He is

2300
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
A series of times he can

2301
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
As long as he can

2302
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
With five

2303
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That

2304
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
CNOT

2305
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So I think

2306
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
At least

2307
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Why

2308
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
At least for people

2309
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Ask them

2310
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
The biggest idea is

2311
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Where is the biggest advantage

2312
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I think this is what they can do

2313
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Emphasize

2314
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Like their CNOT

2315
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It should be up to 97

2316
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Around 98

2317
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
It seems like someone has 99

2318
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But at least I think

2319
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Their advantage

2320
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yeah yeah yeah

2321
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Mr. Cao

2322
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Gate is lower but

2323
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
The chance is bigger

2324
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Any other questions

2325
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
It seems like there's no problem

2326
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Okay

2327
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
If there's no problem today

2328
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000

2346
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
No problem

2347
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah

2348

Bye bye
