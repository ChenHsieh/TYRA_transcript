00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TARA Talk.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
TARA stands for Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It is a friendly forum for young researchers in Taiwan.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We hold TARA Talk every week and every weekend throughout the year.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The format and content of this talk are very free and diverse.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Researchers can share their academic achievements,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
practice online presentations,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
or get to know potential future collaborators.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today's speaker is...

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wei-Zhe, would you like to share your screen?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is it on?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, it is.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Today's speaker is Wei-Zhe Xu.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He is currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
in Chemical and Biological Engineering.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today's talk is on Identifying Signature of...

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce that word.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Protolytic Stability and Dimerization Properties.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He is a simulator.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He gave a wonderful talk at TARA.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
As usual at TARA,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
before the talk starts,

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we will turn on the microphone and give a warm welcome to Wei-Zhe.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, thank you.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Should I start?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, you can start.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello everyone, I am Wei-Zhe Xu.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My main interest in this course is to use...

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
computer molecular dynamics simulations...

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to study different biological and physical phenomena...

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
or develop related algorithms.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you for coming to this talk.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Today's talk is similar to the one I gave at TARA.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is my first time to use Chinese...

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to explain this academic research.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please let me know if you have any questions.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's okay to interrupt me.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Without further ado, let's get started.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Today we are going to discuss...

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
how to use computer simulation...

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to find out the factors that affect...

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the properties of the permutations.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Before we get into today's topic,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
let's take a look at what a permutation looks like.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A permutation is a protein molecule.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is composed of two amino acids.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The blue one and the yellow one.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They are chain A and chain B.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You may have heard of it.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The biggest relationship between a permutation and humans...

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is that it is widely used in diabetes treatment.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For example, there are 34 million people in the US...

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
who are diabetic.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
7 million of them use permutations...

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
as their main treatment method.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Most of the treatment channels for permutations...

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
are done through subcutaneous injection.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Diabetic patients...

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
usually need to be injected 30 minutes before meals.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This means that diabetes patients...

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
need to be injected 2-3 times a day.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you need to be injected 2-3 times a day,

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it will be very uncomfortable.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The biggest drawback of subcutaneous injection...

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is that it is very invasive.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In the past 20 years,

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
scientists have tried to develop...

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
non-invasive treatment channels...

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to reduce the use of subcutaneous injection.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
One of the most potential treatment channels...

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is the so-called oral-diphtheria.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
20 years have passed.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This research has been going on for more than 20 years.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why is it that...

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
we don't hear much about...

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
oral-diphtheria drugs on the market?

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The reason is that...

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the development of oral-diphtheria drugs...

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
has many major challenges.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Most of these challenges...

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
come from the digestive system of the human body.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The first challenge is that...

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
when the gastrointestinal tract goes through the human stomach,

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
gastric acid will destroy the gastrointestinal structure.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The gastrointestinal tract will lose its function.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Basically, this challenge...

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
has been completely solved...

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
some time ago.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Most of the mainstream use...

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is to use some special materials to protect the gastrointestinal tract.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The gastrointestinal tract can...

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This special material...

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
will not be dissolved in the case of acidity.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This can protect the gastrointestinal tract...

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
from being corroded by gastric acid.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When leaving the stomach,

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the gastrointestinal tract...

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
will be dissolved.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The gastrointestinal tract will be dissolved.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The drug will be released.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The first challenge has been solved.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But it was a major challenge...

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in the development of oral-diphtheria drugs.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The next two challenges...

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
have not been completely solved yet.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The first challenge is that...

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the stability of the gastrointestinal system is not very good.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The reason is that...

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
many digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal system...

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
destroy the gastrointestinal tract.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This will also cause the gastrointestinal tract to lose its function.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In addition, the gastrointestinal tract...

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
is not very transparent to the cell membrane.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Usually, we will see that...

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
two gastrointestinal molecules...

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
may gather together...

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and then...

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
become a so-called gastrointestinal 2-gene.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This 2-gene...

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is a relatively large molecule.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it is more difficult to pass through the cell membrane.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The human body's absorption...

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
of gastrointestinal 2-gene...

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
will also become lower.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So the following two challenges...

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
have not been completely solved yet.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Therefore, if we want to develop oral-diphtheria drugs,

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we know that...

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
we hope that oral-diphtheria drugs...

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
will achieve at least two goals.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The first goal is that...

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we hope that it has enough resistance...

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to the digestive enzymes in the human body.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The second goal is that...

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
we hope that it has a relatively low gathering tendency...

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
so that it is easier to reach a higher absorption...

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
of gastrointestinal 2-gene.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In the past few years,

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
there have been a lot of different research methods...

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to experiment with...

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
how to achieve these two goals at the same time.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
A few years ago,

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
in a chemistry synthesis lab...

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that we worked with,

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
they found that...

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in a specific location of the gastrointestinal tract,

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
a specific type of sugar can be added...

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to improve...

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the gastrointestinal tract's resistance...

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to enzymes.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In addition,

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
it can effectively reduce its gathering tendency.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This method is called sugarification.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Basically,

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it is the structure of...

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
a sugar molecule...

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
connected to a gastrointestinal tract.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In the research...

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
conducted by our laboratory,

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
they studied a total of 12 different...

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
gastrointestinal tracts.

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can see that...

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
these 12 gastrointestinal tracts...

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
basically have three control mutations.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The first one is...

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
the location of sugarification.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Here, you can see...

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
my mouse.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is the structure of the gastrointestinal tract.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
These balls...

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
are basically the amino acids...

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that can be sugarified.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There are a total of 51 amino acids in the gastrointestinal tract.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Only five of them...

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
can be added to sugar.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The first mutation is...

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the location of sugarification.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The second mutation is...

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the type of sugar.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
For example, we can see here...

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
GALNAC.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In English, it's N-Acetyl Glycosamin.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not sure how to say it in Chinese,

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but it's a type of sugar.

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The other type of sugar is MANOS.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The main purpose is to study...

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the sugarification mechanism of these two types of sugar.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The third type is...

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
the size of the type of sugar.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can see that the last few types of sugar...

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
from the 7th to the 13th...

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
basically use MANOS...

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
as the base of the type of sugar.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They may use the type of sugar...

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the type of MANOS...

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the type of MANOS-2 or type of MANOS-3...

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
to modify the structure of the amino acid.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For example,

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can see that...

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the picture here...

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
is the structure of a sugarified amino acid.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The blue and yellow...

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
are the amino acids.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The purple is...

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the type of MANOS-3.

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The location of sugarification...

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
is the B27 amino acid.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OK.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So...

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
in our...

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
collaborative lab...

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
research,

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
how did they...

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
from these different sugarified amino acids...

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
find a structure...

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that is more likely to be used as an amino acid...

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
for oral medication?

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They did a series of experiments.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Today, I'm going to talk about the most important one.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
First of all,

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
they measured the resistance of the amino acids.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Basically,

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I put the amino acids...

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and the sugarified amino acids...

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in the same solution...

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to monitor...

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
when the amino acid...

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
is cut off.

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then, we can measure...

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
how long it takes...

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
for the sugarified amino acids...

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to be broken down by the amino acids.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The time it takes...

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
is called alpha-contription half-life.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alpha-contription half-life...

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
is the amino acid...

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that our collaborative lab uses.

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It can break down the amino acids.

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Half-life means...

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the amino acids...

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
are cut into two parts.

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, they lose some of their quality.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The weight is reduced.

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, we can detect...

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the amino acids.

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Basically, the longer it takes...

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
means that the amino acids...

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
need to break down the amino acids.

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The longer it takes...

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
means that the structure of the amino acids...

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is more resistant to the amino acids.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
On the far left, we can see...

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the so-called wild-type.

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a circular amino acid.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It doesn't go through any type of sugar.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We can see that...

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
in the 12 types of amino acids...

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the numbers 9, 10, and 13...

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
are the half-life...

262
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of the alpha-contription half-life.

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This means that...

264
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the amino acids need to break down...

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the amino acids...

266
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
for a longer time.

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This means that...

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
the amino acids are more resistant to the amino acids.

269
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The important ones are 10 and 13.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
9 is a little bit higher than the wild-type.

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
10 and 13 are significantly better...

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
than the circular amino acids.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Coincidentally,

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
these three structures...

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
also have...

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
relatively low...

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
relative gathering tendency.

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
On the right,

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you can see that...

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the wild-type is on the far left.

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The three on the right are 9, 10, and 13.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The blue part of the graph...

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
shows the ratio of the amino acids.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The green part...

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
shows the ratio of the half-life.

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We hope that...

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the lower the relative gathering tendency,

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
the better.

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The higher the amino acid ratio,

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the better.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We can see that...

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
9, 10, and 13...

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
are more resistant to the amino acids.

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We can see that...

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
these three amino acids...

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
have relatively low relative gathering tendency.

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What is the most important discovery...

298
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
of this study?

299
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The most important discovery is that...

300
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
if you look at the structure of 9, 10, and 13,

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
its name is a little bit long.

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a little bit strange.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But from its name,

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
you can probably tell that...

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
these three structures...

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
are all in the position of...

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the B27.

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The group that is connected to the B27...

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
are the single-unit...

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
2-gene...

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
or 3-gene.

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So, the most important discovery...

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
of this study is that...

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
scientists found that...

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
among these 10 kinds of...

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
amino acids,

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
if we connect the single-unit...

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
2-gene...

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
or 3-gene to the B27,

320
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
it can effectively improve the quality...

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
of the amino acids.

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It is more suitable to be used...

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
as an oral medication.

324
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We already know that...

325
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
in the experiment...

326
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
in the general chemical synthesis experiment,

327
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
we are likely to be able to...

328
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
experiment with a dozen kinds of...

329
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
amino acids one by one...

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and then synthesize them one by one.

331
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then compare them one by one with wild-type...

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to identify which amino acid...

333
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
has the best quality.

334
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But if we want to find...

335
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the best amino acid for oral medication,

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
if we want to find the best...

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
amino acid,

338
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
do we need to synthesize...

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
thousands of kinds of...

340
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
amino acids?

341
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Of course, this process...

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is very time-consuming.

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Usually, to synthesize...

344
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
an amino acid...

345
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that does not exist in the natural world,

346
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
it may take a few months.

347
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If it is long, it may take 1-2 years.

348
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So, when...

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
chemical synthesizers...

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
synthesize these amino acids,

351
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
they think that...

352
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
this is too much trouble...

353
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and too much time...

354
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and too much money.

355
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then they start to think that...

356
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
if I can't quickly and efficiently...

357
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
use chemical synthesis to complete this thing,

358
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know if computer simulation...

359
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
can do this thing.

360
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's why...

361
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
our co-worker...

362
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
came to us...

363
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
to do a computer simulation.

364
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The answer to this question is...

365
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
of course, it's possible.

366
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We can use computer simulation...

367
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
to predict...

368
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
which of the selected...

369
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
amino acids...

370
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
may contain the best...

371
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
amino acid.

372
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Our simulation method...

373
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
is called molecular thermodynamics simulation.

374
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Molecular thermodynamics simulation...

375
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is a very vast subject.

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It has a lot of...

377
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
hundreds of...

378
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
different simulations.

379
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Before I talk about...

380
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the common points of these simulations,

381
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
we can think about...

382
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
a simple question about sports.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
For example, you start from...

384
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
your door today.

385
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You walk 1 meter every second.

386
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Where will you be after 10 seconds?

387
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The answer is...

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
you will be 10 meters away from your home.

389
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This is a very simple question...

390
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
about sports.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Most students in high school...

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
are familiar with...

393
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
complex sports questions.

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
For example, acceleration...

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and force.

396
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
These questions are basically...

397
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
as long as we know the starting speed...

398
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and starting position of an object...

399
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and we consider the force...

400
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and acceleration...

401
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we can estimate...

402
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
where the object will appear...

403
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
at a certain point in time.

404
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In a complex system,

405
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
we can even know...

406
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the position, speed...

407
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and acceleration of the object...

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
at any point in time...

409
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or even the energy.

410
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Basically,

411
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
this is what molecular dynamics...

412
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is doing.

413
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In simple terms,

414
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
molecular dynamics...

415
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is an effective way...

416
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to solve...

417
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a series of...

418
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Newton's second law...

419
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and the Hamiltonian.

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How is molecular dynamics...

421
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
actually done?

422
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In a molecular dynamics simulation...

423
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
we have a simulation box.

424
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In this simulation box...

425
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
we put in all the...

426
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
atoms and molecules we want to simulate.

427
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
For example,

428
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
if I want to simulate...

429
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
a permutation of a number...

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I put the permutation of a number...

431
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
into the simulation box.

432
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to simulate...

433
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
a water-soluble...

434
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
water-soluble...

435
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
water-soluble...

436
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
water-soluble...

437
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
water-soluble.

438
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If I want to keep...

439
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
the system neutral...

440
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I add some...

441
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
oxygen or nitrogen...

442
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
to keep the system neutral.

443
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Basically,

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
in the...

445
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
simulation box...

446
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
for each atom...

447
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
for each atom and molecule...

448
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
we have the initial speed...

449
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
speed, position...

450
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and energy...

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and so on.

452
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Through these initial conditions...

453
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
initial conditions...

454
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
or initial conditions...

455
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
if you've studied the equation...

456
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
it's actually initial conditions.

457
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
With these initial conditions...

458
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we can calculate...

459
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
all the atoms...

460
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
at a certain point in the future...

461
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the position...

462
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the speed...

463
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the energy...

464
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and so on.

465
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In a molecular dynamic simulation...

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
we can know...

467
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
in the simulation box...

468
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
how each object...

469
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
moves...

470
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
or even...

471
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in our case...

472
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
how the inner structure...

473
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is close or far from each other.

474
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The animation you see now...

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
you can see different parts...

476
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
moving around.

477
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Basically,

478
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
molecular dynamic simulation...

479
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
allows us to see...

480
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
how an atom...

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
or an atom and an atom...

482
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
interact with each other.

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
With the method...

484
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
we can define...

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
the goal of our research.

486
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Our method is...

487
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
molecular dynamic simulation.

488
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Our goal is...

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to build a simulation...

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
so we don't have to...

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
do chemical synthesis.

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We can find...

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the most likely...

494
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
high-resistance...

495
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and low-resistance structure...

496
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
from a series of...

497
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
carboxylic acids.

498
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is our overall goal.

499
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
In order to build...

500
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
this simulation method...

501
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
we basically focus on...

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
the 12 elements...

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
of carboxylic acids...

504
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
studied by experimentalists.

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
In the simulation...

506
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we first find...

507
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
5 elements of carboxylic acids.

508
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Starting from these 5 elements...

509
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
each of them...

510
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
is like a template.

511
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Each template...

512
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
can be used to generate...

513
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
12 carboxylic acids.

514
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There are 65 elements...

515
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
in the template.

516
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Each of these 65 elements...

517
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
is a long enough...

518
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
molecular dynamic simulation.

519
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The basic logic...

520
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
is that...

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
we run a carboxylic acid simulation...

522
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
followed by a carboxylic acid simulation.

523
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We compare...

524
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the trajectories...

525
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
or the physical properties...

526
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to see if there are any differences.

527
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We try to figure out...

528
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
what are the causes...

529
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that lead to...

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
carboxylic acid resistance...

531
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or carboxylic acid resistance.

532
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We know that...

533
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
the entire process...

534
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
is...

535
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
just by looking at...

536
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the carboxylic acid simulation...

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we can't see anything.

538
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Too many atoms and molecules...

539
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
are moving at the same time.

540
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Many things...

541
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
have to be...

542
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
quantified in the simulation.

543
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The workflow...

544
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
is to set up a hypothesis.

545
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We can assume that...

546
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
a certain amount of carboxylic acid...

547
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is...

548
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
able to affect...

549
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

550
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
or the carboxylic acid resistance.

551
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Then we use the simulation...

552
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
to calculate the amount of carboxylic acid...

553
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and compare it with the experiment.

554
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If it matches the experiment...

555
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it means that the hypothesis...

556
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is plausible.

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If it doesn't match...

558
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
it means that the hypothesis...

559
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is not plausible.

560
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In this research...

561
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
we set up many different hypotheses...

562
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
for two types of carboxylic acid resistance...

563
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and carboxylic acid resistance.

564
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There are many words here.

565
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I won't explain them one by one...

566
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
because they will be mentioned later.

567
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Let's take a look...

568
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
at the hypothesis.

569
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
First, we will focus on...

570
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

571
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
of the carboxylic acid.

572
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then we will look back...

573
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
at the togethering of carboxylic acid.

574
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Then we will look at...

575
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

576
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
of the carboxylic acid.

577
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then we will...

578
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
talk about the interaction between...

579
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid.

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The interaction between...

581
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...

582
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
is mainly...

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The first step is...

584
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I simplify it.

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The mechanism is...

586
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
First, the carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid...

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
will be combined.

588
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
After that, the carboxylic acid will cut...

589
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
some positions of the carboxylic acid.

590
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Then cut the carboxylic acid into two halves...

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
or even three halves...

592
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
three parts, four parts, etc.

593
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But basically, as long as the carboxylic acid is cut...

594
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it will lose its function.

595
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
In all 51 amino acids of carboxylic acid...

596
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
five of them...

597
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
may be...

598
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
cut off by alpha-carbotripsin...

599
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the carboxylic acid.

600
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The two places...

601
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
that are most likely to be cut off...

602
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
are B25 and B26...

603
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the two amino acids.

604
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can see here...

605
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
some of the rings...

606
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
are the structure of the carboxylic acid.

607
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They will be cut off.

608
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Where is the cut off?

609
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
For example,

610
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
for B25 carboxylic acid...

611
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the cut off is between...

612
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
B25 and B26...

613
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the part of the carboxylic acid.

614
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
For B26 carboxylic acid...

615
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the cut off is between...

616
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
B26 and B27...

617
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the part of the carboxylic acid.

618
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Based on this understanding...

619
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
we know that...

620
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the carboxylic acid...

621
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
needs to be cut off.

622
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There is a necessary factor...

623
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that is...

624
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the carboxylic acid...

625
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
needs to be cut off...

626
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.

627
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The whole set of logic...

628
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
that we study...

629
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is to see...

630
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
what is the necessary factor...

631
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that needs to be cut off.

632
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We need to see...

633
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
if there is a way...

634
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
to destroy the necessary factor.

635
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
In this case...

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the necessary factor is...

637
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
that the carboxylic acid...

638
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
needs to be cut off...

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in order to cut off the carboxylic acid.

640
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The first assumption...

641
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
is that...

642
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
if the carboxylic acid is stored...

643
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
inside the carboxylic acid...

644
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
it won't be cut off.

645
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This assumption means that...

646
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the structure...

647
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
has a higher resistance to carboxylic acid.

648
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This is a full assertion.

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We assume that if a...

650
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
sugar is added to the carboxylic acid...

651
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the cut-off sugar is...

652
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
guaranteed to be stored inside.

653
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is a possible...

654
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and effective mechanism.

655
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What do we need to do in this simulation?

656
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How do we quantify this?

657
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
How do we quantify this?

658
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How do we quantify this?

659
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We measure something called SASA.

660
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.

661
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Solve an Accessible Surface Area.

662
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
On paper, this means that...

663
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
the surface area...

664
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
of a carboxylic acid...

665
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in the carboxylic acid environment.

666
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This means that...

667
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the larger the SASA...

668
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the larger the surface area...

669
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
of the carboxylic acid.

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We assume that...

671
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the carboxylic acid...

672
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
is exposed outside.

673
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
If it's covered inside...

674
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
it may not even be exposed to water.

675
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So our assumption today is...

676
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
if a carboxylic acid...

677
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
can lower the SASA...

678
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
of the carboxylic acid B25 and B26...

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it is very likely...

680
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that it can raise the resistance...

681
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
of the carboxylic acid...

682
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to the carboxylic acid.

683
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Let's take a look...

684
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
This diagram looks a bit complicated...

685
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
but basically...

686
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
B25 and B26...

687
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
are the SASA...

688
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
of two different positions.

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The axis...

690
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
is the time it takes...

691
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
for the carboxylic acid...

692
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
to digest the carboxylic acid.

693
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So...

694
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the simplest way...

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
since there are many data points...

696
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the simplest way...

697
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
is to look at the numbers 10 and 13...

698
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
the two carboxylic acids.

699
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Numbers 10 and 13...

700
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
are the two carboxylic acids...

701
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
that have the highest resistance...

702
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to the carboxylic acid...

703
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
in the experiment.

704
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We can see that...

705
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
these two carboxylic acids...

706
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
have a half-life...

707
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
longer than the other carboxylic acids.

708
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This is the result of the experiment.

709
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It shows that...

710
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

711
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
is higher in the experiment.

712
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We can also see that...

713
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
these two carboxylic acids...

714
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
especially number 13...

715
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
have the lowest SASA value.

716
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This means that...

717
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
when the SASA value is low...

718
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

719
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
can be improved.

720
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Although...

721
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
number 10 and 13...

722
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
seem to be consistent...

723
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
with the experiment results...

724
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
there are many exceptions.

725
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
For example, in the square on the right...

726
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
we can see that...

727
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the half-life of the carboxylic acid...

728
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
is relatively low.

729
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This means that...

730
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the carboxylic acid resistance...

731
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
is relatively low.

732
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
However, the SASA value...

733
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
is actually in the middle.

734
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This is contrary...

735
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
to the experiment results.

736
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So, from this...

737
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
measurement method...

738
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
we can only know that...

739
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
the SASA measurement method...

740
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
can only give us...

741
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
partial accurate prediction.

742
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
For those...

743
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
carboxylic acids...

744
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
with high SASA resistance...

745
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
their prediction may be accurate.

746
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
However, for those...

747
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
in the middle value...

748
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
their prediction ability...

749
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
is not so good.

750
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Obviously, we have to...

751
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
find a better...

752
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
model...

753
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to...

754
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to model this phenomenon.

755
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Basically, this model...

756
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the first model...

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
is to look at...

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
the interface between...

759
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
the transfer function and the coefficient.

760
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The second model...

761
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is based on...

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the 2-level structure of the transfer function.

763
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
First of all, the 2-level structure of the transfer function...

764
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is related to...

765
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the location of the carboxylic acid.

766
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Let's look at...

767
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
this graph.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This circle represents...

769
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
the carboxylic acid...

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
which is B25 or B26.

771
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The location of the carboxylic acid...

772
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
is C and P1'.

773
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
P1' is the carboxylic acid next to C.

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It is...

775
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the direction of the carbon.

776
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The opposite direction is...

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
P1, P2 and P3.

778
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
In the past experiments...

779
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
we found that...

780
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the area from P1 to P3...

781
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is usually...

782
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
from the past experiments...

783
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
the area from P1 to P3...

784
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
is usually...

785
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
from the past experiments...

786
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the area from P1 to P3...

787
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
is the omega3 structure...

788
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
in the combination with...

789
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
alpha-carbotrypsin.

790
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
This omega3 structure...

791
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
is a necessary factor...

792
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
required...

793
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
for therefore,

794
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
for example,

795
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
our target omega3...

796
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
oding is very important.

797
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
loss of atoms is between B25 and B26.

798
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Which means...

799
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
from P1 to P3 are equal to...

800
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
if we take B25 as an example,

801
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
P1 is 24,

802
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
followed by 2 3 2 2,

803
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
for B26,

804
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
P1 P2 P3 are 23-25.

805
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If we take both actions,

806
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
B25-B26,

807
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
we need to consider B22-B25,

808
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
P1-P3,

809
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the 2-level structure.

810
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Here,

811
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
our assumption is

812
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
if P1-P3

813
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
become

814
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the lower the beta-shear tendency,

815
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
it will be able to

816
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
increase the antiparticle resistance.

817
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Here,

818
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I would like to remind you that

819
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
our logic is always the same.

820
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
When we assume

821
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
the beta-shear is

822
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the necessary condition

823
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
for the antiparticle resistance,

824
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we will try to break this condition.

825
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Let's assume that

826
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
P1-P3

827
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
become the lower the beta-shear tendency,

828
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
it will be able to

829
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
avoid the antiparticle resistance.

830
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
In simulation,

831
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
how do we calculate

832
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
the beta-shear tendency

833
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
in this region?

834
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Here is a graph called

835
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Raman-Schrödinger plot.

836
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I won't go into details here.

837
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Basically,

838
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it measures

839
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
each amino acid,

840
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
we are interested in amino acids,

841
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
B22-B25,

842
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
each amino acid,

843
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and locate

844
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the location of

845
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
each point

846
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
in the graph.

847
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The more red points

848
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
appear in this region,

849
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it means

850
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the higher the antiparticle resistance

851
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
is.

852
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We hope that

853
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the lower the beta-shear tendency.

854
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's see

855
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the simulation data.

856
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Here,

857
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
the graph looks

858
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
a bit complicated,

859
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
so I won't

860
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
go into details.

861
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Basically,

862
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
here is the conclusion.

863
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We found that

864
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
the beta-shear tendency

865
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
of P1 to P3

866
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
is not related to

867
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
the antiparticle resistance

868
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
of the guide tree.

869
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Some of them

870
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
are not even related.

871
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
This means

872
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that

873
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
our hypothesis

874
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
is wrong.

875
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The reason is

876
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that

877
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
if you are interested,

878
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I can explain it later.

879
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Basically,

880
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the takeaway here

881
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
is that

882
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the second hypothesis is still wrong.

883
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Since the second hypothesis is still wrong,

884
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
we have to think about the third hypothesis.

885
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let me

886
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
help you review.

887
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The first hypothesis

888
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is based on

889
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the difference between

890
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
the antiparticle resistance

891
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
of P1 to P3.

892
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The second hypothesis

893
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
is based on

894
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the second structure of the guide tree.

895
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The third hypothesis

896
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
is based on

897
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the interaction between

898
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
the guide tree

899
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and the antiparticle resistance

900
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
of P1 to P3.

901
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
In the past,

902
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
we found that

903
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

904
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
interacts with

905
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the protein

906
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
that can be cut

907
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
by alpha-chromotrypsin.

908
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
In this example,

909
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
we can see

910
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that

911
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the yellow circle

912
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
is the part of the guide tree.

913
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The square below

914
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
is the amino acid

915
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
of alpha-chromotrypsin.

916
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
In the past,

917
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
we found that

918
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
alpha-chromotrypsin interacts

919
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
with the amino acid of

920
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

921
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The interaction between

922
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
alpha-chromotrypsin and

923
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

924
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
is very common.

925
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The four groups

926
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
are the standard

927
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
interactions

928
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
between the

929
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

930
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and the

931
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

932
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
In this example,

933
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

934
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
interacts with

935
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the amino acid of

936
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

937
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The interaction between

938
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

939
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and

940
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

941
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
is very common.

942
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The interaction between

943
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

944
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and

945
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

946
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
is very common.

947
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
In the case of

948
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
alpha-chromotrypsin,

949
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the interaction

950
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
between

951
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

952
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and

953
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

954
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
is very common.

955
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We found that

956
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the interaction between

957
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

958
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and

959
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

960
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
is very common.

961
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The biggest difference between

962
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
alpha-chromotrypsin and

963
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
alpha-chromotrypsin is that

964
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
alpha-chromotrypsin contains

965
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
a type of sugar,

966
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
whereas alpha-chromotrypsin

967
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
does not.

968
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Let's assume that

969
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the addition of

970
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
a type of sugar

971
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
can disrupt

972
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
the network of

973
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

974
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
In other words,

975
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
if alpha-chromotrypsin

976
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
prefers sugar

977
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
as a donor,

978
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
alpha-chromotrypsin will

979
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
interact with sugar

980
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
to create

981
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
a bond between

982
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

983
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and

984
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

985
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
For example,

986
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
there are several couples

987
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
in front of you

988
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and you want to

989
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
disrupt the bond between

990
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
them,

991
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
so you throw down

992
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
a type of sugar,

993
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
like alpha-chromotrypsin.

994
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Alpha-chromotrypsin

995
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and

996
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

997
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
form a new bond.

998
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Let's assume that

999
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
sugar can disrupt

1000
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
the network of

1001
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

1002
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and alpha-chromotrypsin.

1003
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Let's see

1004
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
if simulation

1005
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
supports this assumption.

1006
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
First,

1007
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
we can see

1008
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
the two structures

1009
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
with the highest

1010
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1011
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We know that

1012
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
10 and 13

1013
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
have the highest

1014
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1015
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
13 is the first one.

1016
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
13,

1017
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
we call it

1018
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
the adsorption power

1019
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
which can be

1020
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
caused by

1021
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

1022
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and

1023
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1024
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
13

1025
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
has four

1026
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
adsorption power

1027
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
with

1028
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the highest

1029
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1030
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
9

1031
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
has two

1032
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
adsorption power.

1033
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
5 and 12

1034
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
have similar

1035
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
adsorption power

1036
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
with alpha-chromotrypsin.

1037
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Therefore,

1038
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
as long as there is

1039
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
adsorption power,

1040
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

1041
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
is better

1042
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
for alpha-chromotrypsin.

1043
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
We can see

1044
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
as long as there is

1045
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
more adsorption power,

1046
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

1047
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
is better for

1048
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1049
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The rest

1050
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
are

1051
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
alpha-chromotrypsin

1052
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
with lower

1053
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
adsorption power

1054
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
than

1055
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
alpha-chromotrypsin.

1056
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Only

1057
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
number 6

1058
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
has lower

1059
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
adsorption power

1060
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1061
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Although

1062
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
number 6

1063
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
has adsorption power,

1064
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
we can see

1065
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that the adsorption power

1066
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
is not very stable.

1067
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Therefore,

1068
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
number 6

1069
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
has almost

1070
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
no adsorption power.

1071
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Therefore,

1072
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
only number 6

1073
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
has adsorption power

1074
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1075
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Therefore,

1076
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
number 6

1077
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
has

1078
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
almost

1079
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
no adsorption power

1080
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1081
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Therefore,

1082
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
number 6

1083
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
has

1084
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
almost

1085
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
no adsorption power

1086
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1087
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Therefore,

1088
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
number 6

1089
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
has

1090
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
almost

1091
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
no adsorption power

1092
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1093
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Therefore,

1094
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
number 6

1095
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
has

1096
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
almost

1097
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
no adsorption power

1098
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1099
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Therefore,

1100
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
number 6

1101
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
has

1102
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
almost

1103
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
no adsorption power

1104
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1105
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Therefore,

1106
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
number 6

1107
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
has

1108
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
almost

1109
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
no adsorption power

1110
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1111
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Therefore,

1112
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
number 6

1113
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
has

1114
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
almost

1115
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
no adsorption power

1116
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1117
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Therefore,

1118
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
number 6

1119
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
has

1120
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
almost

1121
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
no adsorption power

1122
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1123
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Therefore,

1124
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
number 6

1125
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
has

1126
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
almost

1127
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
no adsorption power

1128
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1129
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Therefore,

1130
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
number 6

1131
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
has

1132
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
almost

1133
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
no adsorption power

1134
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1135
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Therefore,

1136
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
number 6

1137
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
has

1138
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
almost

1139
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
no adsorption power

1140
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1141
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Therefore,

1142
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
number 6

1143
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
has

1144
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
almost

1145
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
no adsorption power

1146
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
than alpha-chromotrypsin.

1147
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Therefore,

1148
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
number 6

1149
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
has

1150
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
almost

1151
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
no adsorption power
