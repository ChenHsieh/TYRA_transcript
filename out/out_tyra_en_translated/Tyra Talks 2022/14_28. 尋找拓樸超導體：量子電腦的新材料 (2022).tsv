239000	242000	First of all,
242000	246000	I am a quantum theory physicist.
246000	250000	Today, I am going to share
250000	254000	how a quantum theory physicist
254000	260000	can contribute to the topic.
260000	262000	As you can see,
262000	265000	I am looking for
265000	270000	postdocs and Ph.D. students.
270000	273000	If you find this talk interesting,
273000	276000	please feel free to contact me.
290000	294000	Today, the audience comes from different backgrounds.
294000	296000	I would like to explain
296000	299000	what quantum theory is.
301000	303000	Quantum theory is
303000	306000	condensed matter theoretical physics.
306000	308000	We are studying
308000	310000	quantum theory.
310000	313000	I am not an experimenter.
313000	315000	The tools we use are
315000	318000	computers and pens.
318000	320000	What is quantum theory?
320000	323000	Quantum theory is an equation
323000	326000	that describes the materials
326000	330000	in nature,
330000	333000	and the special materials
333000	337000	in the lab.
337000	340000	All of these materials are
340000	342000	solid or liquid.
342000	344000	This is condensed matter.
344000	346000	As you can see,
346000	350000	this is a diagram.
350000	352000	For example,
352000	354000	this is a two-dimensional material.
354000	357000	It is like a piece of paper.
357000	361000	These black balls
361000	363000	are all atoms.
363000	365000	This is a fairly microscopic scale.
365000	368000	If you look at the size of the atom,
368000	370000	you can see that
370000	372000	there are different scales
372000	374000	in a two-dimensional material.
374000	376000	The scale is hexagonal.
376000	378000	This is just a diagram.
378000	381000	What we are studying
381000	383000	is different materials
383000	385000	with different scales.
385000	387000	You can imagine that
387000	389000	there are atoms next to each atom.
389000	392000	According to quantum mechanics,
392000	395000	there are different activities
395000	397000	around the atom.
397000	399000	What we are studying is
399000	401000	those atoms
401000	404000	in a background like this,
404000	406000	with different scales
406000	408000	in a two-dimensional material.
408000	410000	What interesting things
410000	412000	will happen?
412000	414000	This is the topic
414000	416000	for those who are interested
416000	418000	in quantum physics.
418000	420000	I also want to talk about
420000	422000	what we often hear.
422000	424000	It is very important
424000	426000	for people who do
426000	428000	experimental physics,
428000	430000	especially in quantum mechanics.
430000	432000	What is the relationship
432000	434000	between theory and
434000	436000	experimental physics?
436000	438000	Most important discoveries
438000	440000	in history
440000	442000	in the past 100 years
442000	444000	were made by experiments.
444000	446000	In some experiments,
446000	448000	people found
448000	450000	amazing things
450000	452000	in the material.
452000	454000	Let me give you
454000	456000	an example.
456000	458000	For example,
458000	460000	in the past 100 years,
460000	462000	you can see that
462000	464000	since 2003,
464000	466000	the discovery of superconductors,
466000	468000	superfluid,
468000	470000	superfluid in etheric ocean,
470000	472000	even the famous high-temperature superconductors,
472000	474000	and some important
474000	476000	superconductors were discovered.
476000	478000	These were discovered
478000	480000	by experiments.
480000	482000	These are
482000	484000	four Nobel Prizes.
484000	486000	They were discovered
486000	488000	by experiments
488000	490000	or plans
490000	492000	to discover
492000	494000	special phenomena
494000	496000	in the material.
496000	498000	Then,
498000	500000	theoretical physicists
500000	502000	tried to
502000	504000	understand
504000	506000	the phenomena
506000	508000	in the experiment.
508000	510000	However,
510000	512000	this is not always the case.
512000	514000	Sometimes,
514000	516000	it is the theory
516000	518000	that makes the prediction first.
518000	520000	Then,
520000	522000	experimentalists
522000	524000	tried to see
524000	526000	the predicted phenomena
526000	528000	in the real system.
528000	530000	Sometimes,
530000	532000	these big discoveries
532000	534000	can also be discovered.
534000	536000	However,
536000	538000	this is not always the case.
538000	540000	The reason is that
540000	542000	for superconductors,
542000	544000	this is today's topic.
544000	546000	Of course,
546000	548000	I will explain what superconductors are.
548000	550000	For superconductors,
550000	552000	it is difficult
552000	554000	to make such predictions.
554000	556000	Then,
556000	558000	what I want to do
558000	560000	is to
560000	562000	predict
562000	564000	how to find
564000	566000	special superconductors
566000	568000	in theory,
568000	570000	and
570000	572000	predict
572000	574000	how to make
574000	576000	special superconductors
576000	578000	in theory,
578000	580000	and how to design
580000	582000	special superconductors
582000	584000	in theory.
584000	586000	This is
586000	588000	the focus of my research.
588000	590000	Then,
590000	592000	now,
594000	596000	I will
596000	598000	use a more
598000	600000	physical way
600000	602000	to describe
602000	604000	the problems
604000	606000	that physicists
606000	608000	are studying.
608000	610000	Here is the problem.
610000	612000	You may have seen
612000	614000	the periodic table in high school.
614000	616000	There are so many elements
616000	618000	in the periodic table.
618000	620000	There are more materials.
620000	622000	Because not only these elements,
622000	624000	you can choose
624000	626000	several elements
626000	628000	and combine them
628000	630000	into different compounds.
630000	632000	So,
632000	634000	you can find
634000	636000	tens of thousands
636000	638000	of materials
638000	640000	in nature
640000	642000	or in the lab.
642000	644000	But it sounds
644000	646000	like it is
646000	648000	a very difficult problem
648000	650000	to study the nature of materials.
650000	652000	Why? Let me give you an example.
652000	654000	For example,
654000	656000	let's look at this one.
656000	658000	Cu is copper.
658000	660000	Copper is a very common
660000	662000	material, right?
662000	664000	But today,
664000	666000	I will make some changes
666000	668000	to the copper.
668000	670000	I can remove
670000	672000	some electrons,
672000	674000	neutrons,
674000	676000	and neutrons from the
676000	678000	nucleus.
678000	680000	Then, I can jump
680000	682000	to the next one,
682000	684000	Ni.
684000	686000	It is just next to it.
686000	688000	But their properties
688000	690000	are very different.
690000	692000	Copper has no magnetic properties.
692000	694000	But we know that
694000	696000	Ni is also
696000	698000	magnetic.
698000	700000	So, their properties
700000	702000	are very different.
702000	704000	Now,
704000	706000	let's focus on
706000	708000	one element.
708000	710000	Let's focus on C.
710000	712000	C means carbon.
712000	714000	So,
714000	716000	you can use carbon
716000	718000	to form
718000	720000	this complex 3D structure.
720000	722000	Then, you get diamonds.
722000	724000	If you put
724000	726000	these carbon atoms
726000	728000	into
728000	730000	this 2D structure,
730000	732000	and there are many layers,
732000	734000	then it will be
734000	736000	copper.
736000	738000	It is also carbon,
738000	740000	but it is totally different from diamonds.
740000	742000	If I only take one layer,
742000	744000	then it will be
744000	746000	copper.
746000	748000	It is totally different.
748000	750000	Then,
750000	752000	the blue circles are
752000	754000	carbon.
754000	756000	Although they are all
756000	758000	made of carbon,
758000	760000	their properties are very different.
760000	762000	For example,
762000	764000	diamonds
764000	766000	are very good
766000	768000	solvents,
768000	770000	but
770000	772000	copper and
772000	774000	silver are very good solvents.
774000	776000	Although
776000	778000	these two are solvents,
778000	780000	if you really
780000	782000	pay attention to the numbers,
782000	784000	their
784000	786000	solubility is still very different.
786000	788000	Although you don't have to
788000	790000	care about the unit,
790000	792000	but if you just look at the numbers,
792000	794000	you will know that they are very different.
794000	796000	10 to the power of 8 and 10 to the power of 6
796000	798000	are 100 times different.
798000	800000	Even if
800000	802000	the elements
802000	804000	don't seem to be much different,
804000	806000	or even the same element,
806000	808000	but you build it
808000	810000	into different structures,
810000	812000	their properties can be
812000	814000	100 to the power of 8.
814000	816000	It sounds like
816000	818000	it's a big deal
818000	820000	for people who study materials.
820000	822000	Because there are so many different materials
822000	824000	that can be made in nature
824000	826000	or in a laboratory.
826000	828000	Do we have to
828000	830000	study them one by one?
830000	832000	It takes a lot of time,
832000	834000	manpower, and material resources.
836000	838000	It feels like
838000	840000	it's not a solution.
840000	842000	In fact,
842000	844000	this is not how research is done.
844000	846000	The way we approach
846000	848000	this problem is not
848000	850000	one case by one case.
850000	852000	This is what we do.
852000	854000	Logically,
854000	856000	we classify
856000	858000	so many different materials
858000	860000	according to their
860000	862000	relative properties.
862000	864000	For example,
864000	866000	I classify
866000	868000	red materials
868000	870000	according to their
870000	872000	relative properties.
872000	874000	Then we ask
874000	876000	why the properties of these materials
876000	878000	are the same.
878000	880000	For example,
880000	882000	this cartoon example
882000	884000	is based on
884000	886000	the theory of
886000	888000	quantum physics.
888000	890000	We want to know
890000	892000	why the properties
892000	894000	are the same.
894000	896000	It means that
896000	898000	we don't care
898000	900000	only about the properties
900000	902000	of the materials.
902000	904000	We want to ask
904000	906000	what happened
906000	908000	to make
908000	910000	all the materials
910000	912000	red.
912000	914000	We care about
914000	916000	the size of the materials.
916000	918000	Each ball
918000	920000	represents the size of the materials.
920000	922000	For example,
922000	924000	all the balls are red
924000	926000	because the materials are red.
926000	928000	In fact, the materials are not red,
928000	930000	but they all wear red hats.
930000	932000	We want to know
932000	934000	the size of the materials.
934000	936000	This is a cartoon example.
936000	938000	In fact,
938000	940000	it's not true.
940000	942000	In such a small scale,
942000	944000	the important thing is
944000	946000	that quantum mechanics
946000	948000	becomes very important.
948000	950000	Quantum mechanics
950000	952000	already exists in everyday life,
952000	954000	but because the general scale
954000	956000	is too large,
956000	958000	we can't see the effect of quantum mechanics.
958000	960000	However, quantum mechanics
960000	962000	becomes very important
962000	964000	in the microscopic scale of electronics.
964000	966000	So what we are going to study
966000	968000	is how quantum mechanics
968000	970000	affects the behavior
970000	972000	of these electronics
972000	974000	to make the materials
974000	976000	have certain properties,
976000	978000	such as their color, etc.
978000	980000	Let's use a more academic way
980000	982000	to describe this problem.
982000	984000	It's like this.
984000	986000	What we are studying
986000	988000	is that there are many, many electrons
988000	990000	that spread
990000	992000	in different materials.
992000	994000	These materials
994000	996000	have different lattices,
996000	998000	just like the hexagonal lattice
998000	1000000	I just showed you.
1000000	1002000	They also have different shapes.
1002000	1004000	But when I say many,
1004000	1006000	I mean
1006000	1008000	a lot,
1008000	1010000	like 10 to the power of 23.
1010000	1012000	That's a lot.
1012000	1014000	To study this problem,
1014000	1016000	I can't
1016000	1018000	ask a computer
1018000	1020000	to simulate it.
1020000	1022000	Because there are too many of them.
1022000	1024000	A traditional computer
1024000	1026000	like this
1026000	1028000	can't run
1028000	1030000	a brute force simulation.
1030000	1032000	A computer can't simulate
1032000	1034000	so many examples at once.
1034000	1036000	What's more,
1036000	1038000	there's another point
1038000	1040000	that makes it more complicated.
1040000	1042000	These electrons
1042000	1044000	don't move separately.
1044000	1046000	They interact with each other.
1046000	1048000	So this makes
1048000	1050000	the problem more complicated.
1050000	1052000	Another point
1052000	1054000	is that
1054000	1056000	different lattices
1056000	1058000	have different effects.
1058000	1060000	Different lattices
1060000	1062000	have different shapes.
1062000	1064000	For example,
1064000	1066000	this is a hexagonal lattice.
1066000	1068000	This point and that point
1068000	1070000	have two different colors,
1070000	1072000	meaning two different atoms.
1072000	1074000	I can also show you
1074000	1076000	a triangular lattice.
1076000	1078000	Look at the complex structure.
1078000	1080000	These lattices
1080000	1082000	can have different atoms.
1082000	1084000	So these are
1084000	1086000	different lattices.
1086000	1088000	Their symmetry is different.
1088000	1090000	So I need to
1090000	1092000	not only study
1092000	1094000	the problem of electrons,
1094000	1096000	but also look at the environment
1096000	1098000	of these lattices,
1098000	1100000	the environment of electrons.
1100000	1102000	In fact,
1102000	1104000	these lattices have many symmetries.
1104000	1106000	There are 230 different symmetries
1106000	1108000	in nature.
1108000	1110000	And
1110000	1112000	it's not just
1112000	1114000	the materials in nature.
1114000	1116000	There are various systems
1116000	1118000	that can be created
1118000	1120000	artificially in the laboratory.
1120000	1122000	For example,
1122000	1124000	cold atoms
1124000	1126000	can be cooled
1126000	1128000	to a very low temperature
1128000	1130000	to control
1130000	1132000	how they interact with each other.
1132000	1134000	So even systems like this
1134000	1136000	can be
1136000	1138000	done very well
1138000	1140000	in the lab.
1140000	1142000	So it feels like
1142000	1144000	there are many
1144000	1146000	difficulties.
1146000	1148000	There are many
1148000	1150000	complicated things
1150000	1152000	in it.
1152000	1154000	So if we want to
1154000	1156000	deal with such problems,
1156000	1158000	we have to find a way
1158000	1160000	to simplify such problems.
1160000	1162000	This is a very difficult thing,
1162000	1164000	because the materials
1164000	1166000	are very complicated.
1166000	1168000	So you have to understand
1168000	1170000	the theory behind it,
1170000	1172000	and then use simple but understandable
1172000	1174000	methods to understand
1174000	1176000	what happened
1176000	1178000	at the electron level
1178000	1180000	in the microscope.
1180000	1182000	This is a very challenging thing.
1182000	1184000	But at the same time,
1184000	1186000	everyone is willing to do this.
1186000	1188000	The reason is that
1188000	1190000	this is a very rewarding thing.
1190000	1192000	To understand the nature
1192000	1194000	and the nature of materials
1194000	1196000	is a very interesting thing.
1196000	1198000	But at the same time,
1198000	1200000	to understand the theory
1200000	1202000	behind these materials
1202000	1204000	can have
1204000	1206000	various applications.
1206000	1208000	For example,
1208000	1210000	about 40 years ago,
1210000	1212000	or 60 years ago,
1212000	1214000	physicists and
1214000	1216000	materialists
1216000	1218000	spent a lot of
1218000	1220000	time and effort
1220000	1222000	to understand
1222000	1224000	how a semiconductor works.
1224000	1226000	So now we have
1226000	1228000	all kinds of convenient mobile phones.
1228000	1230000	We are entering the age of computers.
1230000	1232000	Another example is
1232000	1234000	superconductors.
1234000	1236000	The theory of superconductors
1236000	1238000	has been
1238000	1240000	widely understood
1240000	1242000	for a long time.
1242000	1244000	Now,
1244000	1246000	people have started to
1246000	1248000	make large magnets.
1248000	1250000	This is
1250000	1252000	the LHC ring
1252000	1254000	that has been used
1254000	1256000	in the Swiss particle accelerator.
1256000	1258000	These are
1258000	1260000	some examples.
1260000	1262000	If you are able to
1262000	1264000	understand the material
1264000	1266000	in detail,
1266000	1268000	there will be
1268000	1270000	some practical applications.
1270000	1272000	So,
1272000	1274000	how should we
1274000	1276000	simplify such a complicated problem?
1278000	1280000	To put it simply,
1280000	1282000	due to quantum mechanics,
1282000	1284000	electrons will move
1284000	1286000	together
1286000	1288000	at extremely low temperature,
1288000	1290000	which is
1290000	1292000	close to absolute zero.
1292000	1294000	That is,
1294000	1296000	although there are
1296000	1298000	so many electrons in
1298000	1300000	10²³,
1300000	1302000	they will not move
1302000	1304000	and disturb each other.
1304000	1306000	They tend to do
1306000	1308000	the same thing.
1308000	1310000	So,
1310000	1312000	even if the material is
1312000	1314000	of a very different kind,
1314000	1316000	or even the structure
1316000	1318000	of the atom
1318000	1320000	is different,
1320000	1322000	and the sample is made
1322000	1324000	in a different lab,
1324000	1326000	it does not matter.
1326000	1328000	Due to quantum mechanics,
1328000	1330000	there will only be
1330000	1332000	one mode of action,
1332000	1334000	but not infinite.
1334000	1336000	Only a few kinds
1336000	1338000	are likely to occur,
1338000	1340000	and all electrons will move together.
1340000	1342000	So,
1342000	1344000	to study the theory of material,
1344000	1346000	what we need to do
1346000	1348000	is to study
1348000	1350000	the collective mode of action
1350000	1352000	of electrons at low temperature.
1352000	1354000	Then,
1354000	1356000	we need to find a way
1356000	1358000	to classify these modes
1358000	1360000	into different kinds.
1360000	1362000	As long as we can do this,
1362000	1364000	we can do it.
1364000	1366000	So, we don't need to study
1366000	1368000	each material individually,
1368000	1370000	and each material is different.
1372000	1374000	These so-called
1374000	1376000	universal collective behavior
1376000	1378000	actually have another name,
1378000	1380000	which is phases,
1380000	1382000	or you may have heard of
1382000	1384000	images,
1384000	1386000	images of materials.
1386000	1388000	Then,
1388000	1390000	if we want to
1390000	1392000	classify these
1392000	1394000	different images
1394000	1396000	in quantum materials,
1396000	1398000	we need to have some rules
1398000	1400000	so that we can say
1400000	1402000	that the collective behavior
1402000	1404000	of these electrons
1404000	1406000	is one kind,
1406000	1408000	and the collective behavior
1408000	1410000	of those electrons
1410000	1412000	is another kind.
1412000	1414000	So,
1414000	1416000	more than 100 years ago,
1416000	1418000	there was a great physicist
1418000	1420000	named Randall.
1420000	1422000	Randall proposed that
1422000	1424000	we should break
1424000	1426000	the collective behavior
1426000	1428000	of these electrons
1428000	1430000	by symmetry.
1430000	1432000	For example,
1432000	1434000	the most familiar example
1434000	1436000	is the magnet.
1436000	1438000	The reason why
1438000	1440000	the magnetic field
1440000	1442000	and the magnetic field
1442000	1444000	are similar is that
1444000	1446000	if you zoom in
1446000	1448000	and see what the electrons
1448000	1450000	are doing,
1450000	1452000	each electron has
1452000	1454000	a magnetic field.
1454000	1456000	This magnetic field
1456000	1458000	is like a magnet.
1458000	1460000	You can imagine
1460000	1462000	these spins
1462000	1464000	as if there is
1464000	1466000	a small arrow
1466000	1468000	in the electron,
1468000	1470000	and these arrows
1470000	1472000	point from the south
1472000	1474000	to the north.
1474000	1476000	So,
1476000	1478000	the magnet has this kind
1478000	1480000	of magnetic field.
1480000	1482000	The symmetry
1482000	1484000	of the magnet
1484000	1486000	is that
1486000	1488000	these small arrows
1488000	1490000	cannot rotate at will.
1490000	1492000	If it is not in a magnet,
1492000	1494000	these small arrows
1494000	1496000	can rotate at will
1496000	1498000	in the electron.
1498000	1500000	It does not have to
1500000	1502000	point in the same direction,
1502000	1504000	but because it is
1504000	1506000	in a magnet,
1506000	1508000	each small arrow
1508000	1510000	has to point in the same direction.
1510000	1512000	This is symmetry destruction.
1512000	1514000	Another example
1514000	1516000	is this picture.
1516000	1518000	What is this?
1518000	1520000	This is a
1520000	1522000	experimental picture.
1522000	1524000	They used
1524000	1526000	a very small
1526000	1528000	carbon needle
1528000	1530000	to scan the surface
1530000	1532000	of the material.
1532000	1534000	This is the picture they obtained.
1534000	1536000	I don't know if you can see it,
1536000	1538000	but there are
1538000	1540000	little white things here.
1540000	1542000	Those little white things are atoms.
1542000	1544000	But you can also see
1544000	1546000	a relatively large amount
1546000	1548000	of lines.
1548000	1550000	This tells us
1550000	1552000	that if the material
1552000	1554000	is clean enough,
1554000	1556000	the size of the atom
1556000	1558000	is much smaller than the lines.
1558000	1560000	But we can see
1560000	1562000	a wave-shaped
1562000	1564000	line.
1564000	1566000	This is a
1566000	1568000	quantum state.
1568000	1570000	This quantum state
1570000	1572000	destroys
1572000	1574000	the symmetry
1574000	1576000	of the material.
1576000	1578000	This is
1578000	1580000	a translational symmetry.
1580000	1582000	Those are
1582000	1584000	two different examples.
1584000	1586000	Now,
1586000	1588000	let's talk about superconductivity.
1588000	1590000	Superconductivity is
1590000	1592000	also an example.
1592000	1594000	Superconductivity is
1594000	1596000	an interesting quantum state.
1596000	1598000	As we all know,
1598000	1600000	superconductivity
1600000	1602000	is a perfect
1602000	1604000	conductor.
1604000	1606000	Its resistance R is zero.
1606000	1608000	If you can
1608000	1610000	make a wire
1610000	1612000	with superconductivity,
1612000	1614000	the wire will not heat up
1614000	1616000	because there will be no damage.
1616000	1618000	You can pass the wire
1618000	1620000	from one end to the other
1620000	1622000	without any damage.
1622000	1624000	This is superconductivity.
1624000	1626000	There is another
1626000	1628000	characteristic of superconductivity.
1628000	1630000	It does not like magnetic field.
1630000	1632000	This is called Meissner effect.
1632000	1634000	Superconductivity
1634000	1636000	is a perfect conductor
1636000	1638000	and it rejects.
1638000	1640000	These characteristics
1640000	1642000	can only occur at a very low temperature.
1642000	1644000	Otherwise, most of the
1644000	1646000	wires are made with superconductivity.
1646000	1648000	Because the temperature
1648000	1650000	must be low enough.
1650000	1652000	This is
1652000	1654000	why a very popular
1654000	1656000	research topic
1656000	1658000	is to find out
1658000	1660000	if there is superconductivity at room temperature.
1660000	1662000	Let me
1662000	1664000	show you
1664000	1666000	what I mean
1666000	1668000	when I say superconductivity is zero.
1668000	1670000	Let's say this material
1670000	1672000	is a superconductor.
1672000	1674000	You add a current
1674000	1676000	to it
1676000	1678000	to measure
1678000	1680000	its voltage difference.
1680000	1682000	Then you can get superconductivity.
1682000	1684000	If it is
1684000	1686000	a superconductor,
1686000	1688000	when you lower the temperature,
1688000	1690000	it will
1690000	1692000	suddenly become zero
1692000	1694000	at room temperature.
1694000	1696000	However, if it is
1696000	1698000	a non-superconducting metal,
1698000	1700000	its voltage
1700000	1702000	will only
1702000	1704000	decrease but not reach zero.
1704000	1706000	This is the special feature of superconductivity.
1706000	1708000	This is
1708000	1710000	a practical example. This is a ball.
1710000	1712000	When the ball is at a low temperature,
1712000	1714000	it will also become superconductive.
1714000	1716000	So
1716000	1718000	we just said that
1718000	1720000	there are two
1720000	1722000	important properties of superconductivity.
1722000	1724000	One of them is
1724000	1726000	that its resistance will be zero.
1726000	1728000	But what happened
1728000	1730000	to the superconductor
1730000	1732000	when it became zero?
1732000	1734000	In fact,
1736000	1738000	I just showed you this picture.
1738000	1740000	This is a gold bar.
1740000	1742000	The black part
1742000	1744000	is the atom.
1744000	1746000	The atom is moving around the atom.
1746000	1748000	You can imagine
1748000	1750000	that the two atoms are moving around
1750000	1752000	and interacting with each other.
1752000	1754000	There are a lot of atoms.
1754000	1756000	What happened in the superconductor
1756000	1758000	is that
1758000	1760000	the atom and the atom
1760000	1762000	decide not to
1762000	1764000	move separately.
1764000	1766000	They want to
1766000	1768000	move hand in hand
1768000	1770000	and group by group
1770000	1772000	in the gold bar.
1772000	1774000	So
1774000	1776000	they will form
1776000	1778000	an electron-bound state.
1778000	1780000	This kind of electron-bound state
1780000	1782000	is called Cooper pairs.
1782000	1784000	The reason why they are willing to do this
1784000	1786000	instead of individual electron-bound states
1786000	1788000	is because
1788000	1790000	this is less energy for them.
1790000	1792000	So
1792000	1794000	when they form
1794000	1796000	this pair of Cooper pairs,
1796000	1798000	all these Cooper pairs
1800000	1802000	do the same thing
1802000	1804000	together.
1804000	1806000	This is because of the quantum mechanics.
1806000	1808000	So these Cooper pairs
1808000	1810000	do not move
1810000	1812000	one to this side
1812000	1814000	and the other to that side.
1814000	1816000	They all do the same thing.
1816000	1818000	So
1818000	1820000	they do not collide with each other
1820000	1822000	and cause damage.
1822000	1824000	This is why there is no electron-bound state.
1824000	1826000	Because all these Cooper pairs
1826000	1828000	are moving in the same direction.
1828000	1830000	They do not collide
1830000	1832000	and cause damage.
1832000	1834000	And
1834000	1836000	if we want to
1836000	1838000	look at them from the perspective of symmetry destruction,
1838000	1840000	because electrons
1840000	1842000	can form this kind of
1842000	1844000	pair of electrons,
1844000	1846000	but they can also
1846000	1848000	destroy these pair of electrons at any time.
1848000	1850000	So from this perspective,
1850000	1852000	the number of electrons is irregular.
1852000	1854000	OK, so
1854000	1856000	I just gave you three examples
1856000	1858000	to see
1858000	1860000	how to use symmetry destruction
1860000	1862000	to understand the collective behavior
1862000	1864000	of electrons.
1864000	1866000	But this theory is not perfect.
1866000	1868000	In the experiment,
1868000	1870000	we gradually found that
1870000	1872000	although some systems have the same symmetry,
1872000	1874000	although they have different symmetries,
1874000	1876000	some of their
1876000	1878000	observational phenomena are exactly the same.
1878000	1880000	Then there are other examples
1880000	1882000	that their symmetries are different,
1882000	1884000	but
1884000	1886000	their symmetries are the same,
1886000	1888000	but their material properties
1888000	1890000	are very different.
1890000	1892000	So this means that
1892000	1894000	symmetry destruction
1894000	1896000	is not the only
1896000	1898000	tool we should
1898000	1900000	use to understand
1900000	1902000	the collective behavior of electrons.
1902000	1904000	It seems that
1904000	1906000	we still need other new ways to distinguish them.
1906000	1908000	In the past
1908000	1910000	40 years,
1910000	1912000	actually,
1912000	1914000	30 years,
1914000	1916000	we have learned that
1916000	1918000	symmetry destruction
1918000	1920000	is not the only
1920000	1922000	tool we should
1922000	1924000	use to understand
1924000	1926000	the collective behavior of electrons.
1926000	1928000	In the past 30 years,
1928000	1930000	physicists have learned that
1930000	1932000	symmetry destruction
1932000	1934000	is a very important concept
1934000	1936000	in mathematics.
1936000	1938000	By using symmetry destruction
1938000	1940000	to understand materials and physics,
1940000	1942000	we have made a lot of progress
1942000	1944000	in understanding materials.
1944000	1946000	In 2016,
1946000	1948000	the Nobel Prize for Physics
1948000	1950000	was awarded to
1950000	1952000	Thorpe material.
1952000	1954000	Thorpe material
1954000	1956000	was used to understand materials.
1956000	1958000	Here,
1958000	1960000	I would like to
1960000	1962000	use the simplest way
1962000	1964000	to explain what Thorpe is.
1964000	1966000	Because this word
1966000	1968000	looks quite unfamiliar.
1968000	1970000	After all, it is a translation word.
1970000	1972000	In English, it is called topology.
1972000	1974000	In mathematics,
1974000	1976000	Thorpe is a very
1976000	1978000	large field.
1978000	1980000	However, when we use it to understand
1980000	1982000	materials,
1982000	1984000	we only use some of the concepts.
1984000	1986000	Now, I will give you
1986000	1988000	the simplest example
1988000	1990000	that I hope you can understand.
1992000	1994000	So,
1994000	1996000	let's not look at materials.
1996000	1998000	Let's go back to what Thorpe is
1998000	2000000	in mathematics.
2000000	2002000	First,
2002000	2004000	let's get out of the reality.
2004000	2006000	Let's use a more abstract way
2006000	2008000	to think about it.
2008000	2010000	Let's say I have two spaces.
2010000	2012000	The blue space is my base space.
2012000	2014000	The red space is my target space.
2014000	2016000	Let's say
2016000	2018000	the blue space
2018000	2020000	is a circular path.
2020000	2022000	Let's say
2022000	2024000	the blue space
2024000	2026000	is a circular path.
2026000	2028000	The other space
2028000	2030000	is a point.
2030000	2032000	It is a point
2032000	2034000	that can rotate on a plane.
2034000	2036000	The point
2036000	2038000	can rotate
2038000	2040000	from 0 to 360 degrees.
2042000	2044000	Let's say
2044000	2046000	I define these two spaces.
2046000	2048000	I can ask
2048000	2050000	what is the
2050000	2052000	one-to-one relationship
2052000	2054000	between these two spaces.
2054000	2056000	What does it mean?
2056000	2058000	Let's say
2058000	2060000	each point
2060000	2062000	has a point.
2062000	2064000	What is the
2064000	2066000	pattern of this point?
2066000	2068000	I am asking
2068000	2070000	what is the angle
2070000	2072000	of each point.
2072000	2074000	What is the direction
2074000	2076000	of each point?
2076000	2078000	What is the possibility?
2078000	2080000	Let's look at
2080000	2082000	the first example.
2082000	2084000	Let's say
2084000	2086000	I put a arrow
2086000	2088000	on each point.
2088000	2090000	In this example,
2090000	2092000	when I turn around
2092000	2094000	and ask how the arrow rotates,
2094000	2096000	you can see
2096000	2098000	each arrow rotates a little bit,
2098000	2100000	but not much.
2100000	2102000	This situation
2102000	2104000	is totally different
2104000	2106000	from this situation.
2106000	2108000	In this situation,
2108000	2110000	when you walk around
2110000	2112000	the circle,
2112000	2114000	the arrow rotates 360 degrees,
2114000	2116000	which means
2116000	2118000	the arrow rotates a full circle.
2118000	2120000	In this example,
2120000	2122000	when you walk around
2122000	2124000	the circle,
2124000	2126000	the arrow rotates
2126000	2128000	two times.
2132000	2134000	Theoretically,
2134000	2136000	if you continue
2136000	2138000	to walk around
2138000	2140000	the blue circle,
2140000	2142000	you can walk around
2142000	2144000	the whole circle
2144000	2146000	and not only this.
2146000	2148000	You can walk around
2148000	2150000	the whole circle
2150000	2152000	and not only this.
2152000	2154000	In this example,
2154000	2156000	you can use
2156000	2158000	a winding number
2158000	2160000	to describe
2160000	2162000	the rotation of
2162000	2164000	the red arrow.
2164000	2166000	The winding number
2166000	2168000	is the number
2168000	2170000	of the circle
2170000	2172000	of the circle.
2172000	2174000	The winding number
2174000	2176000	is the number
2176000	2178000	of the circle
2178000	2180000	of the circle.
2180000	2182000	Or you can imagine
2182000	2184000	the winding number
2184000	2186000	as a label
2186000	2188000	to mark
2188000	2190000	the different situations.
2190000	2192000	Or you can imagine
2192000	2194000	the winding number
2194000	2196000	as a label
2196000	2198000	to mark
2198000	2200000	the different situations.
2200000	2202000	Or you can imagine
2202000	2204000	the winding number
2204000	2206000	as a label
2206000	2208000	to mark
2208000	2210000	the different situations.
2210000	2212000	Now you can ask
2212000	2214000	how to apply
2214000	2216000	the mathematical definition
2216000	2218000	on the materials
2218000	2220000	and how to find
2220000	2222000	the rotation of
2222000	2224000	the arrow
2224000	2226000	The answer is
2226000	2228000	usually the blue space
2228000	2230000	is the kinetic space of the arrow
2230000	2232000	so it is related to
2232000	2234000	the kinetic space of the arrow.
2234000	2236000	The red space
2236000	2238000	is the
2238000	2240000	position of the electric wave function.
2240000	2242000	For those who don't know
2242000	2244000	what is the electric wave function
2244000	2246000	you can imagine
2246000	2248000	the position of the electric wave function
2248000	2250000	as
2250000	2252000	each arrow
2252000	2254000	points to a small bell
2254000	2256000	and the bell
2256000	2258000	has a red arrow
2258000	2260000	with only 10 arrows.
2260000	2262000	You can imagine
2262000	2264000	the arrow
2264000	2266000	points to
2266000	2268000	the different directions
2268000	2270000	on the bell
2270000	2272000	so you can imagine
2272000	2274000	the bell
2274000	2276000	as the bell.
2276000	2278000	It is similar to the example
2278000	2280000	I showed you
2280000	2282000	The arrow
2282000	2284000	points to the
2284000	2286000	different directions
2286000	2288000	on the bell
2288000	2290000	and the bell
2290000	2292000	has a red arrow
2292000	2294000	with only 10 arrows.
2294000	2296000	I have just
2296000	2298000	explained
2298000	2300000	the meaning of
2300000	2302000	the elliptic
2302000	2304000	and how to define
2304000	2306000	the elliptic
2306000	2308000	in the materials.
2308000	2310000	Is it because
2310000	2312000	the elliptic has a special nature?
2312000	2314000	Even though
2314000	2316000	the elliptic
2316000	2318000	has a special nature,
2318000	2320000	if the
2320000	2322000	experiment
2322000	2324000	doesn't show
2324000	2326000	the elliptic,
2326000	2328000	it is just a
2328000	2330000	definition of the elliptic.
2330000	2332000	The answer is
2332000	2334000	the elliptic
2334000	2336000	has a special nature
2336000	2338000	when the
2338000	2340000	elliptic
2340000	2342000	points to the
2342000	2344000	different directions
2344000	2346000	on the bell.
2346000	2348000	What does it mean?
2348000	2350000	Let me give you
2350000	2352000	a famous example.
2352000	2354000	It is called
2354000	2356000	integer quantum Hall effect.
2356000	2358000	What does it mean?
2358000	2360000	Let's take
2360000	2362000	a metal or
2362000	2364000	a semiconductor film
2364000	2366000	and measure the
2366000	2368000	cross section
2368000	2370000	of the current I
2370000	2372000	with the
2372000	2374000	current V
2374000	2376000	and the
2376000	2378000	current I.
2378000	2380000	If you take
2380000	2382000	the ratio of
2382000	2384000	V and I,
2384000	2386000	you can get
2386000	2388000	the Hall resistance
2388000	2390000	rho h.
2390000	2392000	If the experiment
2392000	2394000	is done at room temperature,
2394000	2396000	many materials
2396000	2398000	and physics
2398000	2400000	do the experiment
2400000	2402000	at the university.
2402000	2404000	You can ask
2404000	2406000	how the Hall resistance
2406000	2408000	changes with the
2408000	2410000	size of the magnetic field.
2410000	2412000	I can tell you
2412000	2414000	it is a linear change.
2414000	2416000	The bigger the magnetic field,
2416000	2418000	the bigger the Hall resistance.
2418000	2420000	However,
2420000	2422000	if you do the experiment
2422000	2424000	at low temperature,
2424000	2426000	you will find
2426000	2428000	the result is very different.
2428000	2430000	As the magnetic field
2430000	2432000	gets bigger,
2432000	2434000	you can see
2434000	2436000	the curve is like a step.
2436000	2438000	What's more,
2438000	2440000	we call it
2440000	2442000	quantized plateaus.
2442000	2444000	It is one step at a time.
2444000	2446000	What's more,
2446000	2448000	if you look at
2448000	2450000	the value
2450000	2452000	of Hall resistance,
2452000	2454000	you will find
2454000	2456000	it is
2456000	2458000	one over
2458000	2460000	a whole number.
2460000	2462000	This is the amazing part.
2462000	2464000	This part,
2464000	2466000	h over e squared,
2466000	2468000	is a universal constant.
2468000	2470000	It is just a value.
2470000	2472000	You can think of it as a fixed number,
2472000	2474000	26kΩ.
2474000	2476000	However,
2476000	2478000	this part, one over c,
2478000	2480000	tells you c is a whole number.
2480000	2482000	In other words,
2482000	2484000	if you read its value,
2484000	2486000	it is 26 divided by 2,
2486000	2488000	which is 13.
2488000	2490000	Similarly,
2490000	2492000	26 divided by 3, 26 divided by 4, etc.
2492000	2494000	Why is it amazing?
2494000	2496000	The amazing result
2496000	2498000	is because
2498000	2500000	people found
2500000	2502000	different experiments
2502000	2504000	from different people
2504000	2506000	to get the same result.
2506000	2508000	However,
2508000	2510000	the result is exactly the same.
2510000	2512000	The value is
2512000	2514000	exactly
2514000	2516000	negative 9 times of 10.
2516000	2518000	So,
2518000	2520000	it is very strange.
2520000	2522000	These values
2522000	2524000	become
2524000	2526000	the common unit
2526000	2528000	of quantum mechanics
2528000	2530000	in the end.
2530000	2532000	So,
2532000	2534000	it is very amazing.
2534000	2536000	In 1982,
2536000	2538000	a quantum theorist
2538000	2540000	found that
2540000	2542000	the reason behind this result
2542000	2544000	is that
2544000	2546000	the electron
2546000	2548000	goes around
2548000	2550000	2, 3, 4, etc.
2550000	2552000	So,
2552000	2554000	the result is
2554000	2556000	exactly the same.
2556000	2558000	However,
2558000	2560000	I don't have time
2560000	2562000	to explain
2562000	2564000	why it is so.
2564000	2566000	So, this is the first
2566000	2568000	characteristic of top material,
2568000	2570000	which is that
2570000	2572000	the conductor
2572000	2574000	is the value of
2574000	2576000	the whole number.
2576000	2578000	The second
2578000	2580000	interesting characteristic is that
2580000	2582000	if
2582000	2584000	this square
2584000	2586000	is a two-dimensional
2586000	2588000	top material,
2588000	2590000	we can find that
2590000	2592000	there is an electron
2592000	2594000	going along the same direction
2594000	2596000	on the edge of the sample.
2596000	2598000	So,
2598000	2600000	these electrons
2600000	2602000	just sit on the edge of the sample.
2602000	2604000	There is no electron inside.
2604000	2606000	Moreover,
2606000	2608000	they go along the same direction.
2608000	2610000	So,
2610000	2612000	this characteristic
2612000	2614000	can be seen
2614000	2616000	in almost all
2616000	2618000	top materials.
2618000	2620000	So, this is the second interesting characteristic.
2620000	2622000	So,
2622000	2624000	after the whole number
2624000	2626000	quantum Hall effect,
2626000	2628000	we found that
2628000	2630000	it is not just a wave model.
2630000	2632000	In fact, many metals,
2632000	2634000	semiconductors, or solvents
2634000	2636000	can have top characteristics,
2636000	2638000	which means that
2638000	2640000	they all have the transmission characteristics of the whole number,
2640000	2642000	and they all have electron flow on the edge.
2642000	2644000	Now, I want to ask a question.
2644000	2646000	How can I define a top superconductor?
2646000	2648000	That is to say,
2648000	2650000	when electrons form a qubit like this
2650000	2652000	at low temperature,
2652000	2654000	in the case of
2654000	2656000	a two-dimensional qubit,
2656000	2658000	can I also have a top characteristic?
2658000	2660000	The answer is of course yes.
2660000	2662000	So,
2662000	2664000	let me give you a definition first.
2664000	2666000	That is to say,
2666000	2668000	how do I define a top superconductor
2668000	2670000	according to the definition
2670000	2672000	we just explained?
2672000	2674000	All the important information
2674000	2676000	related to the superconductor
2676000	2678000	is hidden
2678000	2680000	in the
2680000	2682000	kinetic energy of an electron itself,
2682000	2684000	and when it
2684000	2686000	forms
2686000	2688000	a qubit,
2688000	2690000	what is its wave function?
2690000	2692000	So, simply put,
2692000	2694000	if you want to describe a superconductor,
2694000	2696000	any superconductor,
2696000	2698000	basically what you care about is
2698000	2700000	what is its kinetic energy before it forms a qubit,
2700000	2702000	and what is its wave function
2702000	2704000	after it forms a qubit.
2704000	2706000	As long as you know these two things,
2706000	2708000	you can basically understand
2708000	2710000	most of the
2710000	2712000	properties of a superconductor.
2714000	2716000	So,
2716000	2718000	using those two things,
2718000	2720000	the kinetic energy of a single electron
2720000	2722000	and the wave function of a qubit,
2722000	2724000	these two quantities,
2724000	2726000	C and Δ,
2726000	2728000	I can construct
2728000	2730000	a three-dimensional superconductor.
2730000	2732000	I'm just showing it off,
2732000	2734000	but you don't really need to understand it.
2734000	2736000	In short, it's a superconductor
2736000	2738000	constructed by those two quantities.
2738000	2740000	From this superconductor,
2740000	2742000	I can play the game I just played,
2742000	2744000	construct and define
2744000	2746000	two different spaces.
2746000	2748000	The first space is still
2748000	2750000	the kinetic energy of an electron,
2750000	2752000	but the second space
2752000	2754000	is not just a qubit,
2754000	2756000	but a three-dimensional superconductor
2756000	2758000	because it's a three-dimensional superconductor.
2758000	2760000	So you can imagine
2760000	2762000	it's just a qubit,
2762000	2764000	and it can rotate
2764000	2766000	in a three-dimensional space.
2766000	2768000	I can ask
2768000	2770000	if there is
2770000	2772000	a circle
2772000	2774000	between these two spaces.
2776000	2778000	You can imagine
2778000	2780000	this
2780000	2782000	three-dimensional
2782000	2784000	superconductor space
2784000	2786000	is a qubit,
2786000	2788000	and it can rotate
2788000	2790000	in a three-dimensional space.
2790000	2792000	That's pretty much it.
2794000	2796000	There is a very famous example,
2796000	2798000	which is
2798000	2800000	a P-wave superconductor.
2800000	2802000	If you have
2802000	2804000	heard of
2804000	2806000	related physics,
2806000	2808000	or know more about
2808000	2810000	related physics,
2810000	2812000	this is a famous example.
2812000	2814000	What is the thing
2814000	2816000	that rotates here?
2816000	2818000	It's the wave function of
2818000	2820000	the cooper pair.
2820000	2822000	You can see it's rotating around
2822000	2824000	on its qubit.
2824000	2826000	Another important property is
2826000	2828000	that in this special
2828000	2830000	superconductor,
2830000	2832000	the magnetic field
2832000	2834000	of the electron
2834000	2836000	must be the same
2836000	2838000	as the magnetic field
2838000	2840000	of the qubit.
2840000	2842000	It's a Pauli Exclusion Principle.
2842000	2844000	Statistics
2844000	2846000	must be the same.
2846000	2848000	OK.
2848000	2850000	Next, let's ask
2850000	2852000	what properties does this superconductor have?
2852000	2854000	Here comes the important part.
2854000	2856000	Remember
2856000	2858000	the second type of
2858000	2860000	superconductor properties I mentioned?
2860000	2862000	Is there electromagnetic flow
2862000	2864000	on the boundary of the sample?
2864000	2866000	In the
2866000	2868000	semiconductor,
2868000	2870000	we can say
2870000	2872000	there is electromagnetic flow
2872000	2874000	on the boundary of the sample.
2874000	2876000	But in the superconductor,
2876000	2878000	you can still find something
2878000	2880000	on the boundary of the sample.
2880000	2882000	But the special example
2882000	2884000	is not an ordinary electron.
2884000	2886000	It's a special example
2886000	2888000	called Majorana.
2888000	2890000	So it is
2890000	2892000	only on the boundary of the sample.
2892000	2894000	But how special is it?
2894000	2896000	The special thing is
2896000	2898000	it is the same
2898000	2900000	as its antiparticle.
2900000	2902000	It is a special example
2902000	2904000	of antiparticle.
2904000	2906000	OK.
2906000	2908000	These are some examples.
2908000	2910000	For example,
2910000	2912000	if you have a 1-dimensional superconductor,
2912000	2914000	you can find Majorana particle
2914000	2916000	on the boundary of
2916000	2918000	the 2-dimensional superconductor.
2918000	2920000	It is 0-dimensional.
2920000	2922000	If you have a gray 2-dimensional
2922000	2924000	superconductor,
2924000	2926000	you can find a 1-dimensional
2926000	2928000	Majorana mole
2928000	2930000	on the boundary.
2930000	2932000	If you have a 3-dimensional superconductor,
2932000	2934000	you can find a 2-dimensional
2934000	2936000	Majorana mole
2936000	2938000	on the surface of
2938000	2940000	the 3-dimensional superconductor.
2940000	2942000	But what I want to emphasize today
2942000	2944000	is that in this 2-dimensional example,
2944000	2946000	there is an additional place
2946000	2948000	where you can find Majorana mole.
2948000	2950000	That is to say,
2950000	2952000	if the magnetic field
2952000	2954000	penetrates the superconductor,
2954000	2956000	you will form a lot of curvatures.
2956000	2958000	That is to say,
2958000	2960000	the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor.
2960000	2962000	In the middle of these curvatures,
2962000	2964000	you can also find
2964000	2966000	a 0-dimensional Majorana mole.
2966000	2968000	OK.
2968000	2970000	Then,
2970000	2972000	when this kind of
2972000	2974000	2-dimensional superconductor
2974000	2976000	is 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional,
2976000	2978000	people are particularly
2978000	2980000	interested in it.
2980000	2982000	Because it has quantum computing
2982000	2984000	as a possible application.
2984000	2986000	If we want to talk about quantum computing,
2986000	2988000	we have to focus on
2988000	2990000	this 0-dimensional Majorana mole.
2990000	2992000	So it is 0-dimensional and energy is 0.
2992000	2994000	We call it Majorana zero mole.
2994000	2996000	There are a lot of
2996000	2998000	research shows that
2998000	3000000	it is proposed that
3000000	3002000	using
3002000	3004000	the curvature
3004000	3006000	generated by the magnetic field
3006000	3008000	I just mentioned
3008000	3010000	to form the Majorana mole,
3010000	3012000	to form the so-called qubit.
3012000	3014000	The qubit is
3014000	3016000	the qubit in quantum computing.
3016000	3018000	So what is a qubit?
3018000	3020000	In a traditional computer,
3020000	3022000	in a traditional computer,
3022000	3024000	we know that there are a lot of 0s and 1s, right?
3024000	3026000	Then the qubit
3026000	3028000	is the thing
3028000	3030000	0 and 1
3030000	3032000	corresponding to the quantum computer.
3032000	3034000	But it is no longer
3034000	3036000	just 0 and 1.
3036000	3038000	There are different numbers.
3038000	3040000	But I don't have time
3040000	3042000	to go into that part.
3042000	3044000	So I will
3044000	3046000	mention
3046000	3048000	what are the benefits
3048000	3050000	of using the Turp superconverter
3050000	3052000	to do quantum computing.
3052000	3054000	Why do we have to use the Turp superconverter?
3054000	3056000	The advantage of using the Turp superconverter
3056000	3058000	to do quantum computing is
3058000	3060000	quantum computing
3060000	3062000	has always been
3062000	3064000	a possible problem that everyone cares about.
3064000	3066000	For example,
3066000	3068000	if you put a quantum computer
3068000	3070000	in an environment,
3070000	3072000	it can do
3072000	3074000	very powerful calculations,
3074000	3076000	but due to environmental impact,
3076000	3078000	it will still be affected by the environment,
3078000	3080000	so it will lead to errors in the calculation.
3080000	3082000	And if the error rate
3082000	3084000	is too high,
3084000	3086000	quantum computing will not be established.
3086000	3088000	But if you use
3088000	3090000	the Turp superconverter
3090000	3092000	as the material
3092000	3094000	to do quantum computing,
3094000	3096000	this qubit,
3096000	3098000	the smallest computing unit,
3098000	3100000	is not
3100000	3102000	in the same place.
3102000	3104000	Instead,
3104000	3106000	I can take two
3106000	3108000	relatively distant currents
3108000	3110000	and the Mariana Zero Mode
3110000	3112000	as a qubit.
3112000	3114000	In other words,
3114000	3116000	if I have some
3116000	3118000	local noise
3118000	3120000	in this environment,
3120000	3122000	it will not destroy
3122000	3124000	the information in this qubit.
3124000	3126000	Because I can't
3126000	3128000	affect the two Mariana Zero Mode
3128000	3130000	at the same time.
3130000	3132000	I usually only affect one side,
3132000	3134000	but not the other side.
3134000	3136000	In this case,
3136000	3138000	you have to affect
3138000	3140000	both sides at the same time
3140000	3142000	to affect the calculation.
3142000	3144000	So this is why
3144000	3146000	everyone says that
3146000	3148000	using the Turp superconverter
3148000	3150000	is the best way
3150000	3152000	to do quantum computing.
3152000	3154000	It is also a way
3154000	3156000	to do quantum computing
3156000	3158000	with higher convergence rate.
3158000	3160000	Finally,
3160000	3162000	I want to say
3162000	3164000	that it sounds pretty good,
3164000	3166000	right?
3166000	3168000	If there is a Turp superconverter,
3168000	3170000	we can use it
3170000	3172000	to build a quantum computer.
3172000	3174000	Why haven't I heard about it?
3174000	3176000	The reason is
3176000	3178000	what kind of material
3178000	3180000	is a Turp superconverter?
3180000	3182000	The answer is
3182000	3184000	almost none.
3184000	3186000	In other words,
3186000	3188000	the existence of a Turp superconverter
3188000	3190000	is actually a quantum material
3190000	3192000	that has been predicted
3192000	3194000	by theory.
3194000	3196000	But what kind of
3196000	3198000	actual material
3198000	3200000	is a Turp superconverter?
3200000	3202000	Then you can find
3202000	3204000	the Mariana Zero Mode in it.
3204000	3206000	This is a big problem.
3206000	3208000	Although there are
3208000	3210000	a lot of papers
3210000	3212000	claiming that
3212000	3214000	they have seen
3214000	3216000	the Mariana Zero Mode
3216000	3218000	in their system,
3218000	3220000	I think it's fair to say
3220000	3222000	that our community
3222000	3224000	can't really
3224000	3226000	have an experiment
3226000	3228000	that is very confident
3228000	3230000	that they have
3230000	3232000	seen a Mariana qubit
3232000	3234000	in their system.
3234000	3236000	I think this is
3236000	3238000	a direction that
3238000	3240000	we are still working on.
3240000	3242000	Although I don't have
3242000	3244000	enough time now,
3244000	3246000	I will mention
3246000	3248000	that my research
3248000	3250000	is to use
3250000	3252000	various different
3252000	3254000	theories to find
3254000	3256000	different strategies
3256000	3258000	and systematic recipes
3258000	3260000	to predict
3260000	3262000	a Turp superconverter.
3262000	3264000	Theoretically, after making
3264000	3266000	such a prediction,
3266000	3268000	I will make a proposal
3268000	3270000	to my experiment partners
3270000	3272000	hoping that they can
3272000	3274000	really find the material
3274000	3276000	and verify whether
3276000	3278000	the material is really
3278000	3280000	a Turp superconverter.
3280000	3282000	In the last few minutes,
3282000	3284000	let me give you
3284000	3286000	one or two examples.
3286000	3288000	For example,
3288000	3290000	you don't need to know
3290000	3292000	what it is.
3292000	3294000	I just want to emphasize
3294000	3296000	that this material
3296000	3298000	caused a stir
3298000	3300000	20 years ago.
3300000	3302000	People think
3302000	3304000	this should be a Turp superconverter
3304000	3306000	because many of its properties
3306000	3308000	look like a Turp superconverter.
3308000	3310000	But in fact,
3310000	3312000	the Mariana Zero Mode
3312000	3314000	in the nest was not seen.
3314000	3316000	Later, it should be a few years ago,
3316000	3318000	people found that
3318000	3320000	some experiments were wrong.
3320000	3322000	In fact, this kind of superconverter
3322000	3324000	is not a Turp superconverter.
3324000	3326000	It is not a Turp superconverter,
3326000	3328000	and it must be
3328000	3330000	a superconverter
3330000	3332000	at a very low temperature.
3332000	3334000	These are the shortcomings of this material.
3334000	3336000	In the past,
3336000	3338000	we proposed
3338000	3340000	that experiments
3340000	3342000	should be able to pull
3342000	3344000	or push it,
3344000	3346000	or grow it
3346000	3348000	on a mold of different sizes
3348000	3350000	in an experimental way,
3350000	3352000	so that its size
3352000	3354000	is extended or compressed.
3354000	3356000	In this way,
3356000	3358000	my collaborators
3358000	3360000	can see
3360000	3362000	some experimental pictures,
3362000	3364000	but I just want to tell you
3364000	3366000	that you can see
3366000	3368000	the quality of the material
3368000	3370000	can be greatly changed
3370000	3372000	by pulling
3372000	3374000	or compressing it.
3374000	3376000	In theory,
3376000	3378000	we can predict
3378000	3380000	that when it is pulled
3380000	3382000	or compressed to some extent,
3382000	3384000	this material
3384000	3386000	can be easier to become a Turp superconverter,
3386000	3388000	and its temperature
3388000	3390000	will also increase.
3390000	3392000	So this is
3392000	3394000	an example of what we did
3394000	3396000	in the past.
3396000	3398000	There are some other works,
3398000	3400000	but I may not have time to mention today,
3400000	3402000	so I will only show you
3402000	3404000	this cover image.
3404000	3406000	We have done various works,
3406000	3408000	and the first example
3408000	3410000	is that
3410000	3412000	we proposed
3412000	3414000	how to design
3414000	3416000	the material
3416000	3418000	so that the query of the Kubernetes
3418000	3420000	is in the same direction.
3420000	3422000	In this way,
3422000	3424000	it is easier to get a Turp superconverter.
3424000	3426000	Another way
3426000	3428000	is to introduce different
3428000	3430000	symmetries
3430000	3432000	to make the material
3432000	3434000	have the Marana Zero Mode.
3434000	3436000	We also did
3436000	3438000	other things,
3438000	3440000	such as using math to
3440000	3442000	deduce some Turp invariants,
3442000	3444000	and then using
3444000	3446000	machine learning
3446000	3448000	to systematically
3448000	3450000	go through
3450000	3452000	the database
3452000	3454000	with
3454000	3456000	thousands of materials.
3456000	3458000	It is difficult
3458000	3460000	to find
3460000	3462000	the Turp superconverter
3462000	3464000	directly,
3464000	3466000	but by using
3466000	3468000	the Turp invariants
3468000	3470000	or machine learning,
3470000	3472000	we can systematically
3472000	3474000	find which materials
3474000	3476000	are more likely.
3476000	3478000	I don't have time
3478000	3480000	to talk about these details today,
3480000	3482000	so I will stop here.
3482000	3484000	If you have any questions,
3484000	3486000	please feel free to ask.
3514000	3516000	If you have any questions,
3516000	3518000	please feel free to ask.
3544000	3546000	If you add a magnetic field,
3546000	3548000	you can create
3548000	3550000	a vortex.
3550000	3552000	Yes, the magnetic field
3552000	3554000	cannot be too large.
3554000	3556000	If the magnetic field is too large,
3556000	3558000	the superconverter will be
3558000	3560000	rejected,
3560000	3562000	and the magnetic field
3562000	3564000	will destroy the superconverter.
3564000	3566000	So we are talking about
3566000	3568000	a magnetic field
3568000	3570000	smaller than the critical B field
3570000	3572000	to create a vortex
3572000	3574000	Okay, I see.
3574000	3576000	Thank you.
3602000	3604000	Hello.
3604000	3606000	I am teaching
3606000	3608000	at Chengda Electronics.
3608000	3610000	I started
3610000	3612000	doing quantum computing
3612000	3614000	around April this year.
3614000	3616000	To be honest,
3616000	3618000	I have studied
3618000	3620000	modern physics,
3620000	3622000	and the physics I just mentioned
3622000	3624000	are too profound for me.
3624000	3626000	I would like to know
3626000	3628000	from the perspective
3628000	3630000	of physicists,
3630000	3632000	that is,
3632000	3634000	if we want to do
3634000	3636000	image processing,
3636000	3638000	the special point
3638000	3640000	of image processing
3640000	3642000	is that we can take
3642000	3644000	a picture of millions of pixels.
3644000	3646000	In other words,
3646000	3648000	even if we only need
3648000	3650000	8 bits for a pixel,
3650000	3652000	I may need
3652000	3654000	8 million bits, right?
3654000	3656000	For a quantum computer,
3656000	3658000	it may be 8 million bits.
3658000	3660000	8 million qubits.
3660000	3662000	In the case of IBM's
3662000	3664000	more powerful quantum computer,
3664000	3666000	it may only have
3666000	3668000	about 80 bits.
3668000	3670000	I would like to know
3670000	3672000	that physicists think
3672000	3674000	that the difference in the number
3674000	3676000	of qubits,
3676000	3678000	if we want to break through
3678000	3680000	an order, for example,
3680000	3682000	to make it 10 times,
3682000	3684000	for example,
3684000	3686000	from 80 to 800 qubits,
3686000	3688000	how can we make
3688000	3690000	a breakthrough?
3690000	3692000	I think this is
3692000	3694000	a very good question.
3694000	3696000	Now,
3696000	3698000	various companies
3698000	3700000	have their own
3700000	3702000	favorite physical system.
3702000	3704000	For example,
3704000	3706000	Google has its own,
3706000	3708000	IBM has its own,
3708000	3710000	and Microsoft has its own.
3710000	3712000	So the method I'm talking about
3712000	3714000	is the method
3714000	3716000	of quantum computing.
3716000	3718000	Its advantage is that
3718000	3720000	I don't know
3720000	3722000	their actual experiment.
3722000	3724000	Now they are
3724000	3726000	very serious about
3726000	3728000	this project,
3728000	3730000	so I don't know
3730000	3732000	their current progress.
3732000	3734000	But I can tell you
3734000	3736000	that this path,
3736000	3738000	topological quantum computing,
3738000	3740000	its advantage is
3740000	3742000	that it is very small.
3742000	3744000	That is to say,
3744000	3746000	the size of these vortexes
3746000	3748000	can be very close.
3748000	3750000	Then it can be very small
3750000	3752000	compared to other methods,
3752000	3754000	such as IBM's method.
3754000	3756000	So it has a way to scale up.
3756000	3758000	That is to say,
3758000	3760000	when they have a way
3760000	3762000	to make a qubit,
3762000	3764000	in theory,
3764000	3766000	they have the potential
3766000	3768000	to make more
3768000	3770000	qubits.
3770000	3772000	In addition,
3772000	3774000	I'm not
3774000	3776000	an expert
3776000	3778000	in quantum computing algorithms,
3778000	3780000	but in theory,
3780000	3782000	if it is
3782000	3784000	more fault tolerant,
3784000	3786000	you don't need
3786000	3788000	many physical qubits
3788000	3790000	to make
3790000	3792000	a real qubit.
3792000	3794000	So this is
3794000	3796000	the potential
3796000	3798000	I can see
3798000	3800000	in quantum computing.
3800000	3802000	But I don't know
3802000	3804000	whether it can be done
3804000	3806000	in 5 to 10 years.
3806000	3808000	But I think there is a chance.
3808000	3810000	Otherwise, these big companies
3810000	3812000	wouldn't invest so much
3812000	3814000	effort, right?
3814000	3816000	They are doing this
3816000	3818000	very seriously now.
3818000	3820000	I have a second question.
3820000	3822000	It's also
3822000	3824000	from my research.
3824000	3826000	We have a big problem
3826000	3828000	with quantum computing.
3828000	3830000	Quantum computing has
3830000	3832000	an uncopyability.
3832000	3834000	When we want to
3834000	3836000	measure a qubit,
3836000	3838000	we can only measure it once,
3838000	3840000	and the quantum state
3840000	3842000	is gone.
3842000	3844000	We wanted to
3844000	3846000	find a solution.
3846000	3848000	Then I asked
3848000	3850000	a teacher
3850000	3852000	who makes materials.
3852000	3854000	He said a very
3854000	3856000	well-known
3856000	3858000	supercomputer
3858000	3860000	can be used to
3860000	3862000	measure a qubit,
3862000	3864000	and the quantum state
3864000	3866000	is gone.
3866000	3868000	I'm not sure
3868000	3870000	if there is
3870000	3872000	any real
3872000	3874000	experimental evidence
3874000	3876000	in your field,
3876000	3878000	or
3878000	3880000	if you haven't
3880000	3882000	heard of it.
3882000	3884000	Actually, I don't know
3884000	3886000	the theory of supercomputing.
3886000	3888000	I need to read
3888000	3890000	the article.
3890000	3892000	Otherwise,
3892000	3894000	I don't know
3894000	3896000	what it means.
3896000	3898000	But this is
3898000	3900000	a problem.
3900000	3902000	I can imagine
3902000	3904000	when you do the measurement,
3904000	3906000	it collapses to a state.
3906000	3908000	Maybe there is a way
3908000	3910000	to reconstruct
3910000	3912000	the original state.
3912000	3914000	I've heard
3914000	3916000	some talks
3916000	3918000	trying to do this
3918000	3920000	with machine learning.
3920000	3922000	That's right.
3922000	3924000	But
3924000	3926000	we can
3926000	3928000	discuss it later.
3928000	3930000	We can discuss it
3930000	3932000	offline.
3932000	3934000	I think what Mr. Xu said
3934000	3936000	is right.
3936000	3938000	We found that
3938000	3940000	we have to use machine learning.
3940000	3942000	That's something
3942000	3944000	we did recently.
3944000	3946000	We used deep learning
3946000	3948000	to solve it.
3948000	3950000	But I think
3950000	3952000	physicists may need
3952000	3954000	to solve
3954000	3956000	these two problems.
3956000	3958000	I think these are
3958000	3960000	the two bottlenecks.
3960000	3962000	Interesting.
3962000	3964000	We can discuss it later.
3964000	3966000	Thank you.
3966000	3968000	Hello.
3968000	3970000	Please go ahead.
3970000	3972000	I can't
3972000	3974000	turn on
3974000	3976000	the camera.
3976000	3978000	So I will
3978000	3980000	speak directly.
3980000	3982000	I'm a professor at
3982000	3984000	the Department of Mass Physics.
3984000	3986000	My name is Gao Xianzhong.
3986000	3988000	I have a question.
3988000	3990000	Someone asked
3990000	3992000	if you are a
3992000	3994000	topological superconductor
3994000	3996000	and
3996000	3998000	you are a type 2 superconductor
3998000	4000000	and you add a magnetic field,
4000000	4002000	there may be
4002000	4004000	a zero-dimension
4004000	4006000	marinara mode
4006000	4008000	near the
4008000	4010000	vortex core.
4010000	4012000	I want to ask
4012000	4014000	that
4014000	4016000	in general,
4016000	4018000	in many cases,
4018000	4020000	when you add a magnetic field,
4020000	4022000	it doesn't
4022000	4024000	form a single flux core.
4024000	4026000	For example,
4026000	4028000	it may form
4028000	4030000	a Bricose-off-Lattice.
4030000	4032000	There will be many cores.
4032000	4034000	Yes.
4034000	4036000	Are these
4036000	4038000	cores
4038000	4040000	equal to
4040000	4042000	the magnetic field
4042000	4044000	on the material
4044000	4046000	divided by the magnetic field of the unit?
4048000	4050000	This is a good question.
4050000	4052000	I haven't
4052000	4054000	thought about it.
4054000	4056000	It sounds reasonable.
4056000	4058000	We can discuss the details later.
4058000	4060000	I want to
4060000	4062000	emphasize that
4062000	4064000	I only draw one here,
4064000	4066000	but if it is
4066000	4068000	an application like
4068000	4070000	quantum computing,
4070000	4072000	it really needs a lot.
4072000	4074000	Because it is
4074000	4076000	a pair of
4076000	4078000	vortex plus
4078000	4080000	a zero-dimension
4080000	4082000	marinara mode.
4082000	4084000	It is not
4084000	4086000	a single thing.
4086000	4088000	Of course, we don't
4088000	4090000	only need one core.
4090000	4092000	We need many cores.
4092000	4094000	I think
4094000	4096000	the question you just asked
4096000	4098000	is very important.
4098000	4100000	If we need many cores,
4100000	4102000	we need to know
4102000	4104000	the size of the material
4104000	4106000	and the magnetic field.
4106000	4108000	I haven't thought about it.
4108000	4110000	I can't answer you
4110000	4112000	precisely now.
4112000	4114000	We can talk about it later.
4120000	4122000	Let me
4122000	4124000	ask the question in the chat.
4128000	4130000	Hello, I am Xiong Weiren.
4130000	4132000	I am currently doing research
4132000	4134000	in the Central Academy of Medicine.
4134000	4136000	It is said that electrons
4136000	4138000	have the same
4138000	4140000	mode of action
4140000	4142000	at extremely low temperature,
4142000	4144000	such as superconductivity.
4144000	4146000	But what is the direction
4146000	4148000	of superconductivity
4148000	4150000	at room temperature?
4156000	4158000	Let me
4158000	4160000	try to understand
4160000	4162000	your question.
4162000	4164000	What I said
4164000	4166000	at the beginning
4166000	4168000	is that
4168000	4170000	in fact,
4170000	4172000	there are several modes
4172000	4174000	of action at extremely low temperature,
4174000	4176000	such as superconductivity
4176000	4178000	or magnetism.
4178000	4180000	Or the charge density wave
4180000	4182000	I just showed you.
4182000	4184000	Electrons will
4184000	4186000	show the pattern
4186000	4188000	of the beam.
4188000	4190000	There are several patterns.
4190000	4192000	One of them is superconductivity.
4192000	4194000	But we can ask
4194000	4196000	what is the nature of superconductivity?
4196000	4198000	Is it helpful
4198000	4200000	in application?
4200000	4202000	The answer is that it has no damage,
4202000	4204000	so it is very good.
4204000	4206000	We hope to apply it
4206000	4208000	to our daily life,
4208000	4210000	such as various appliances
4210000	4212000	or wires,
4212000	4214000	right?
4214000	4216000	That's why people want to
4216000	4218000	ask if there is superconductivity
4218000	4220000	at room temperature.
4220000	4222000	Is there any way to see
4222000	4224000	superconductivity at room temperature?
4224000	4226000	That's the motivation.
4226000	4228000	But you can ask
4228000	4230000	if there is
4230000	4232000	actually a way to do it.
4232000	4234000	Recently,
4234000	4236000	many articles
4236000	4238000	are trying to
4238000	4240000	say that they have seen
4240000	4242000	superconductivity at room temperature,
4242000	4244000	but there are some controversies.
4244000	4246000	The general principle
4246000	4248000	is that you have to add a lot of pressure.
4250000	4252000	There must be a trade-off.
4252000	4254000	You can see it
4254000	4256000	at low temperature,
4256000	4258000	or you can see it
4258000	4260000	at room temperature,
4260000	4262000	but you have to add a lot of pressure.
4262000	4264000	That's what I've heard so far.
4264000	4266000	Of course,
4266000	4268000	there are some famous examples,
4268000	4270000	such as the so-called high-temperature superconductor,
4270000	4272000	which is also
4272000	4274000	negative 200 degrees C.
4274000	4276000	It's still very low-temperature,
4276000	4278000	but it's over 100 degrees higher
4278000	4280000	than the original one.
4280000	4282000	This kind of high-temperature superconductor
4282000	4284000	relies on the progress of the material.
4284000	4286000	That is to say, they make
4286000	4288000	some copper-based superconductors.
4288000	4290000	It's obviously a ceramic material.
4290000	4292000	It should be insoluble,
4292000	4294000	but at low temperature,
4294000	4296000	at minus 200 degrees,
4296000	4298000	it may become a superconductor.
4298000	4300000	Another direction
4300000	4302000	is to understand
4302000	4304000	such a feature,
4304000	4306000	which is a high-temperature superconductor,
4306000	4308000	its surrounding physical mechanism,
4308000	4310000	and then
4310000	4312000	to find out
4312000	4314000	if the surrounding physical mechanism
4314000	4316000	can amplify the behavior
4316000	4318000	in different material families.
4318000	4320000	Some people also pursue
4320000	4322000	this kind of logic
4322000	4324000	to see if there is any way
4324000	4326000	to make other materials at room temperature,
4326000	4328000	without adding a lot of pressure.
4328000	4330000	I hope I have answered your question.
4332000	4334000	Thank you, Mr. Xu,
4334000	4336000	for your wonderful speech.
4336000	4338000	Is there any other material
4338000	4340000	that may not be a superconductor?
4340000	4342000	For example,
4342000	4344000	double-layered stainless steel?
4348000	4350000	Hello?
4350000	4352000	Can you hear me?
4352000	4354000	Yes, yes, yes.
4354000	4356000	You can talk about the last part.
4356000	4358000	Does it stop at double-layered stainless steel?
4358000	4360000	For example,
4360000	4362000	double-layered stainless steel?
4364000	4366000	Oh, I see.
4366000	4368000	Is it possible that
4368000	4370000	double-layered stainless steel
4370000	4372000	is a candidate?
4372000	4374000	Yes, yes, it is possible.
4374000	4376000	That's a good question.
4376000	4378000	Double-layered stainless steel
4378000	4380000	is a very popular material recently.
4380000	4382000	It is a double-layered stainless steel.
4382000	4384000	It can actually be done.
4384000	4386000	Then they will turn it
4386000	4388000	in a small angle.
4388000	4390000	The reason is that
4390000	4392000	it can be used to
4392000	4394000	control the interaction between
4394000	4396000	electrons and electrons,
4396000	4398000	or the size of the interaction
4398000	4400000	between the two.
4400000	4402000	If the interaction is more effective,
4402000	4404000	the superconductor
4404000	4406000	can have
4406000	4408000	all kinds of different
4408000	4410000	quantum states.
4410000	4412000	One of them is the superconductor.
4412000	4414000	It has not been fully
4414000	4416000	confirmed yet,
4416000	4418000	but many theories,
4418000	4420000	including some of my own work,
4420000	4422000	predict that
4422000	4424000	in such a system,
4424000	4426000	when you have some
4426000	4428000	parameters on the material,
4428000	4430000	how to adjust them,
4430000	4432000	it is indeed possible that it is a top superconductor.
4432000	4434000	So this is possible.
4434000	4436000	Some of my past work
4436000	4438000	has also predicted
4438000	4440000	a lot of double-layered materials
4440000	4442000	similar to stainless steel,
4442000	4444000	like the hexagonal material just now,
4444000	4446000	where each atom is not
4446000	4448000	carbon, but some other
4448000	4450000	transition metal, etc.
4450000	4452000	There are some other
4452000	4454000	atoms in the cycle table.
4454000	4456000	If you put it there,
4456000	4458000	it is another type of
4458000	4460000	transition metal that can be
4460000	4462000	collagenized.
4462000	4464000	Those can also be
4464000	4466000	torn apart layer by layer
4466000	4468000	with 3M tape.
4468000	4470000	I have some work to predict
4470000	4472000	that it may also be a superconductor.
4474000	4476000	Okay.
4476000	4478000	Next question.
4478000	4480000	Hello, I am Hong Shi-An.
4480000	4482000	I am currently doing my PhD at NIST.
4482000	4484000	Since I have not studied
4484000	4486000	topological quantum
4486000	4488000	QC, quantum computing,
4488000	4490000	I would like to ask
4490000	4492000	which two states
4492000	4494000	can be used
4494000	4496000	as 0 and 1?
4496000	4498000	Why can it be immutable
4498000	4500000	to localized noise?
4500000	4502000	This is a big question.
4502000	4504000	For more details,
4504000	4506000	I can recommend
4506000	4508000	a very good
4508000	4510000	review article
4510000	4512000	called Review of Modern Physics
4512000	4514000	by RMP.
4514000	4516000	In general,
4518000	4520000	it is not only
4520000	4522000	0 and 1.
4522000	4524000	Generally,
4524000	4526000	it does not have to be
4526000	4528000	topological quantum computing.
4528000	4530000	As long as it is quantum computing,
4530000	4532000	it uses a quantum state
4532000	4534000	to store information.
4534000	4536000	In the quantum state,
4536000	4538000	it is not
4538000	4540000	100%
4540000	4542000	or 1%
4542000	4544000	but
4544000	4546000	a probability.
4546000	4548000	For example,
4548000	4550000	50% is 0,
4550000	4552000	50% is 1,
4552000	4554000	etc.
4554000	4556000	It is a spectrum.
4556000	4558000	It is not
4558000	4560000	limited to
4560000	4562000	0 and 1.
4562000	4564000	It can store information
4564000	4566000	in various proportions.
4566000	4568000	There are more ways
4568000	4570000	to store information.
4570000	4572000	When you ask
4572000	4574000	what 0 and 1 are,
4574000	4576000	it does not have
4576000	4578000	a direct correspondence.
4578000	4580000	It is difficult to explain directly.
4580000	4582000	Simply put,
4582000	4584000	I did not say
4584000	4586000	that qubits can be used
4586000	4588000	to store information.
4588000	4590000	For example,
4590000	4592000	half-quantum vortex
4592000	4594000	can be used
4594000	4596000	as a qubit.
4596000	4598000	There are many qubits.
4598000	4600000	All of them
4600000	4602000	can have
4602000	4604000	high degeneracy
4604000	4606000	in such a state.
4606000	4608000	Many configurations
4608000	4610000	have the same energy.
4610000	4612000	When you do
4612000	4614000	some braiding
4614000	4616000	to exchange
4616000	4618000	their positions,
4618000	4620000	etc.,
4620000	4622000	you can jump
4622000	4624000	from one degenerate state
4624000	4626000	to another degenerate state.
4628000	4630000	This is a
4630000	4632000	kind of operation.
4632000	4634000	Hilbert states
4634000	4636000	can store
4636000	4638000	information
4638000	4640000	corresponding to
4640000	4642000	only 0 and 1.
4642000	4644000	It is not easy
4644000	4646000	to explain in detail.
4646000	4648000	If you have
4648000	4650000	any questions,
4650000	4652000	we can
4652000	4654000	discuss offline later.
4654000	4656000	The reason why
4656000	4658000	I say it is
4658000	4660000	immune to localized noise
4660000	4662000	is that
4662000	4664000	the qubits are
4664000	4666000	composed of
4666000	4668000	a pair of half-quantum vortex
4668000	4670000	and a pair of
4670000	4672000	degenerate states.
4672000	4674000	They are entangled,
4674000	4676000	but they can be
4676000	4678000	in two different places.
4678000	4680000	When you jump from
4680000	4682000	one degenerate state
4682000	4684000	to another,
4684000	4686000	you can only
4686000	4688000	jump from
4688000	4690000	one degenerate state
4690000	4692000	to another
4692000	4694000	by braiding.
4694000	4696000	Other operations
4696000	4698000	are not sensitive to noise.
4698000	4700000	That's why I say
4700000	4702000	it is immune to localized noise.
4702000	4704000	Unless you have
4704000	4706000	a special noise
4706000	4708000	that can
4708000	4710000	braid two different qubits.
4710000	4712000	If you can
4712000	4714000	find a noise
4714000	4716000	that can do this,
4716000	4718000	it can't be immune
4718000	4720000	to localized noise.
4720000	4722000	I hope I can
4722000	4724000	answer your question.
4728000	4730000	Okay.
4730000	4732000	The last two questions
4732000	4734000	are from the same person.
4734000	4736000	Hello,
4736000	4738000	I'm Zhang Zhiyuan.
4738000	4740000	I'm currently studying at Tsinghua University.
4740000	4742000	I'd like to ask
4742000	4744000	if Marijuana
4744000	4746000	Zero Mode
4746000	4748000	is stable
4748000	4750000	or
4750000	4752000	will it decay
4752000	4754000	after some time?
4754000	4756000	Also,
4756000	4758000	do you always
4758000	4760000	use the first law
4760000	4762000	or do you use
4762000	4764000	different methods
4764000	4766000	to study the theory of
4766000	4768000	denatured states?
4768000	4770000	That's a good question.
4770000	4772000	The first question is
4772000	4774000	that it is an eigenstate.
4774000	4776000	It is a Hamiltonian
4776000	4778000	eigenstate,
4778000	4780000	so it is a stable state.
4780000	4782000	Theoretically,
4782000	4784000	it shouldn't decay
4784000	4786000	Another question is
4786000	4788000	that I don't use the first law.
4788000	4790000	I have a lot of
4790000	4792000	collaborators who use the first law.
4792000	4794000	What I do is
4796000	4798000	from
4798000	4800000	mean field theory
4800000	4802000	to
4802000	4804000	mean field theory,
4804000	4806000	renormalization group,
4806000	4808000	diagrammatic calculation,
4808000	4810000	and
4810000	4812000	we also use
4812000	4814000	k-theory
4814000	4816000	to deduce the
4816000	4818000	unchangeable number,
4818000	4820000	topological invariant,
4820000	4822000	and then work with
4822000	4824000	collaborators using the first law
4824000	4826000	to calculate
4826000	4828000	the number
4828000	4830000	deduced
4830000	4832000	from the
4832000	4834000	material library.
4838000	4840000	OK.
4840000	4842000	That's all for
4842000	4844000	the first part of the
4844000	4846000	Q&A.
4846000	4848000	Please turn on
4848000	4850000	the microphone
4850000	4852000	to thank
4852000	4854000	Professor Xu.
4854000	4856000	Thank you.
4856000	4858000	Let me
4858000	4860000	turn off
4860000	4862000	the recording first.
4862000	4864000	OK.
