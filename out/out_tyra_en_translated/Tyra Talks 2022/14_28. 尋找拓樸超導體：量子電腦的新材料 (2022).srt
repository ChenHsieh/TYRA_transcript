38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Today's speaker is Mr. Xu.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He graduated from National Tsinghua University in 2009.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Later, he came to Cornell for a Ph.D.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
a Ph.D. in physics.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In 2017,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
he obtained his doctorate.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After graduating from Cornell,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
he came to the

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000

Condensed Matter Theory Center.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In 2020,

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
he got a Ph.D. from the University of Newfoundland-Myanmar.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
His main interest is

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the new phenomenon of quantum many-body system.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
His main focus is

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
inter-winded symmetry,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
topology,

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and many-body interaction.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Today, he is going to talk about

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
topology and quantum computing.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Today, he is going to talk about

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
topology and quantum computing.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's follow Tara's post

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and welcome Mr. Xu.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hello, everyone.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Today, I am going to talk about

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the relationship between topology and quantum computing.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I will try my best to be scientific.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you have any questions,

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
please feel free to ask me.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
First of all,

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am a quantum theory physicist.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today, I am going to share

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
how a quantum theory physicist

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
can contribute to the topic.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
As you can see,

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I am looking for

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
postdocs and Ph.D. students.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you find this talk interesting,

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
please feel free to contact me.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Today, the audience comes from different backgrounds.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I would like to explain

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
what quantum theory is.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Quantum theory is

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
condensed matter theoretical physics.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We are studying

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
quantum theory.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am not an experimenter.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The tools we use are

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
computers and pens.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What is quantum theory?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Quantum theory is an equation

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that describes the materials

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in nature,

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and the special materials

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
in the lab.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All of these materials are

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
solid or liquid.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is condensed matter.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
As you can see,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
this is a diagram.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
For example,

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
this is a two-dimensional material.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It is like a piece of paper.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
These black balls

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
are all atoms.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is a fairly microscopic scale.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you look at the size of the atom,

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you can see that

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
there are different scales

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in a two-dimensional material.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The scale is hexagonal.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is just a diagram.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What we are studying

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is different materials

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
with different scales.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can imagine that

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
there are atoms next to each atom.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
According to quantum mechanics,

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
there are different activities

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
around the atom.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What we are studying is

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
those atoms

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in a background like this,

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
with different scales

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in a two-dimensional material.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What interesting things

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
will happen?

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the topic

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
for those who are interested

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in quantum physics.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I also want to talk about

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
what we often hear.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It is very important

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
for people who do

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
experimental physics,

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
especially in quantum mechanics.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What is the relationship

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
between theory and

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
experimental physics?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Most important discoveries

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in history

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in the past 100 years

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
were made by experiments.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In some experiments,

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
people found

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
amazing things

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in the material.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me give you

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
an example.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
For example,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
in the past 100 years,

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you can see that

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
since 2003,

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the discovery of superconductors,

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
superfluid,

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
superfluid in etheric ocean,

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
even the famous high-temperature superconductors,

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and some important

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
superconductors were discovered.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These were discovered

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
by experiments.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
These are

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
four Nobel Prizes.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They were discovered

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
by experiments

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
or plans

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to discover

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
special phenomena

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
in the material.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then,

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
theoretical physicists

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
tried to

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
understand

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the phenomena

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in the experiment.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
However,

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
this is not always the case.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sometimes,

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it is the theory

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
that makes the prediction first.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then,

180
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
experimentalists

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
tried to see

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the predicted phenomena

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in the real system.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sometimes,

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
these big discoveries

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
can also be discovered.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
However,

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
this is not always the case.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The reason is that

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for superconductors,

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
this is today's topic.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Of course,

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will explain what superconductors are.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
For superconductors,

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
it is difficult

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to make such predictions.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then,

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
what I want to do

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
is to

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
predict

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
how to find

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
special superconductors

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
in theory,

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
predict

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
how to make

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
special superconductors

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in theory,

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and how to design

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
special superconductors

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
in theory.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the focus of my research.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then,

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
now,

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I will

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
use a more

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
physical way

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
to describe

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the problems

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that physicists

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
are studying.

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Here is the problem.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You may have seen

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the periodic table in high school.

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There are so many elements

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
in the periodic table.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There are more materials.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because not only these elements,

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you can choose

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
several elements

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and combine them

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
into different compounds.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So,

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you can find

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
tens of thousands

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
of materials

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in nature

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
or in the lab.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But it sounds

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like it is

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a very difficult problem

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to study the nature of materials.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why? Let me give you an example.

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
For example,

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
let's look at this one.

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Cu is copper.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Copper is a very common

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
material, right?

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But today,

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I will make some changes

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to the copper.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can remove

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
some electrons,

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
neutrons,

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and neutrons from the

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
nucleus.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then, I can jump

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
to the next one,

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ni.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It is just next to it.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But their properties

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
are very different.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Copper has no magnetic properties.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But we know that

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ni is also

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
magnetic.

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, their properties

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
are very different.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now,

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
let's focus on

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
one element.

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's focus on C.

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
C means carbon.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So,

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you can use carbon

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to form

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
this complex 3D structure.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then, you get diamonds.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you put

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
these carbon atoms

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
into

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
this 2D structure,

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and there are many layers,

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
then it will be

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
copper.

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It is also carbon,

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but it is totally different from diamonds.

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If I only take one layer,

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
then it will be

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
copper.

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It is totally different.

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then,

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the blue circles are

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
carbon.

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Although they are all

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
made of carbon,

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
their properties are very different.

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
For example,

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
diamonds

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
are very good

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
solvents,

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
copper and

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
silver are very good solvents.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Although

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
these two are solvents,

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
if you really

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
pay attention to the numbers,

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
their

311
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
solubility is still very different.

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Although you don't have to

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
care about the unit,

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but if you just look at the numbers,

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you will know that they are very different.

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
10 to the power of 8 and 10 to the power of 6

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
are 100 times different.

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the elements

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
don't seem to be much different,

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
or even the same element,

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
but you build it

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
into different structures,

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
their properties can be

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
100 to the power of 8.

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It sounds like

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it's a big deal

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
for people who study materials.

329
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because there are so many different materials

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that can be made in nature

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
or in a laboratory.

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Do we have to

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
study them one by one?

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It takes a lot of time,

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
manpower, and material resources.

336
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It feels like

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it's not a solution.

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
In fact,

339
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
this is not how research is done.

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The way we approach

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
this problem is not

342
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
one case by one case.

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is what we do.

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Logically,

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
we classify

346
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
so many different materials

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
according to their

348
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
relative properties.

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
For example,

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I classify

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
red materials

352
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
according to their

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
relative properties.

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then we ask

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
why the properties of these materials

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
are the same.

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
For example,

358
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
this cartoon example

359
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is based on

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the theory of

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
quantum physics.

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We want to know

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
why the properties

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
are the same.

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It means that

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
we don't care

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
only about the properties

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
of the materials.

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We want to ask

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
what happened

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
to make

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
all the materials

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
red.

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We care about

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the size of the materials.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Each ball

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
represents the size of the materials.

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
For example,

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
all the balls are red

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
because the materials are red.

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
In fact, the materials are not red,

382
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
but they all wear red hats.

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We want to know

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the size of the materials.

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is a cartoon example.

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
In fact,

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
it's not true.

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
In such a small scale,

389
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the important thing is

390
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that quantum mechanics

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
becomes very important.

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Quantum mechanics

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
already exists in everyday life,

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but because the general scale

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is too large,

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
we can't see the effect of quantum mechanics.

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
However, quantum mechanics

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
becomes very important

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
in the microscopic scale of electronics.

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So what we are going to study

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is how quantum mechanics

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
affects the behavior

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
of these electronics

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
to make the materials

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
have certain properties,

406
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
such as their color, etc.

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's use a more academic way

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to describe this problem.

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's like this.

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What we are studying

411
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
is that there are many, many electrons

412
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that spread

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
in different materials.

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
These materials

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
have different lattices,

416
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
just like the hexagonal lattice

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I just showed you.

418
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They also have different shapes.

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But when I say many,

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean

421
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
a lot,

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
like 10 to the power of 23.

423
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's a lot.

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
To study this problem,

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
ask a computer

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
to simulate it.

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because there are too many of them.

429
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A traditional computer

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
like this

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
can't run

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a brute force simulation.

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
A computer can't simulate

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
so many examples at once.

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What's more,

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
there's another point

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that makes it more complicated.

438
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
These electrons

439
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
don't move separately.

440
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They interact with each other.

441
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So this makes

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the problem more complicated.

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Another point

444
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
is that

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
different lattices

446
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
have different effects.

447
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Different lattices

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
have different shapes.

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For example,

450
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
this is a hexagonal lattice.

451
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This point and that point

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
have two different colors,

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
meaning two different atoms.

454
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can also show you

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
a triangular lattice.

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Look at the complex structure.

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
These lattices

458
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
can have different atoms.

459
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So these are

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
different lattices.

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Their symmetry is different.

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So I need to

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
not only study

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the problem of electrons,

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but also look at the environment

466
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
of these lattices,

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the environment of electrons.

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In fact,

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
these lattices have many symmetries.

470
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There are 230 different symmetries

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
in nature.

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's not just

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the materials in nature.

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There are various systems

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that can be created

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
artificially in the laboratory.

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
For example,

479
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
cold atoms

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
can be cooled

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to a very low temperature

482
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to control

483
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
how they interact with each other.

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So even systems like this

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
can be

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
done very well

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in the lab.

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So it feels like

489
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
there are many

490
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
difficulties.

491
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There are many

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
complicated things

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
in it.

494
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So if we want to

495
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
deal with such problems,

496
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we have to find a way

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to simplify such problems.

498
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is a very difficult thing,

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
because the materials

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
are very complicated.

501
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So you have to understand

502
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the theory behind it,

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and then use simple but understandable

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
methods to understand

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
what happened

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
at the electron level

507
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in the microscope.

508
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is a very challenging thing.

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But at the same time,

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
everyone is willing to do this.

511
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The reason is that

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
this is a very rewarding thing.

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
To understand the nature

514
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and the nature of materials

515
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is a very interesting thing.

516
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But at the same time,

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
to understand the theory

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
behind these materials

519
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
can have

520
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
various applications.

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
For example,

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
about 40 years ago,

523
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
or 60 years ago,

524
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
physicists and

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
materialists

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
spent a lot of

527
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
time and effort

528
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to understand

529
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
how a semiconductor works.

530
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So now we have

531
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
all kinds of convenient mobile phones.

532
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We are entering the age of computers.

533
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Another example is

534
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
superconductors.

535
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The theory of superconductors

536
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
has been

537
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
widely understood

538
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
for a long time.

539
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now,

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
people have started to

541
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
make large magnets.

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This is

543
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the LHC ring

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
that has been used

545
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
in the Swiss particle accelerator.

546
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
These are

547
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
some examples.

548
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you are able to

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
understand the material

550
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
in detail,

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
there will be

552
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
some practical applications.

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So,

554
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
how should we

555
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
simplify such a complicated problem?

556
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
To put it simply,

557
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
due to quantum mechanics,

558
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
electrons will move

559
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
together

560
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
at extremely low temperature,

561
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
which is

562
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
close to absolute zero.

563
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That is,

564
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
although there are

565
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so many electrons in

566
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
10²³,

567
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
they will not move

568
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and disturb each other.

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They tend to do

570
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the same thing.

571
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So,

572
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
even if the material is

573
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
of a very different kind,

574
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
or even the structure

575
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
of the atom

576
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
is different,

577
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and the sample is made

578
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in a different lab,

579
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it does not matter.

580
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Due to quantum mechanics,

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
there will only be

582
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
one mode of action,

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but not infinite.

584
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Only a few kinds

585
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
are likely to occur,

586
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and all electrons will move together.

587
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So,

588
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to study the theory of material,

589
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
what we need to do

590
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is to study

591
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
the collective mode of action

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
of electrons at low temperature.

593
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then,

594
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we need to find a way

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to classify these modes

596
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
into different kinds.

597
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
As long as we can do this,

598
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
we can do it.

599
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, we don't need to study

600
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
each material individually,

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and each material is different.

602
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
These so-called

603
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
universal collective behavior

604
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
actually have another name,

605
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
which is phases,

606
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or you may have heard of

607
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
images,

608
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
images of materials.

609
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then,

610
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
if we want to

611
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
classify these

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
different images

613
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
in quantum materials,

614
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
we need to have some rules

615
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
so that we can say

616
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
that the collective behavior

617
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
of these electrons

618
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
is one kind,

619
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and the collective behavior

620
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of those electrons

621
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
is another kind.

622
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So,

623
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
more than 100 years ago,

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
there was a great physicist

625
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
named Randall.

626
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Randall proposed that

627
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
we should break

628
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the collective behavior

629
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
of these electrons

630
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
by symmetry.

631
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
For example,

632
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the most familiar example

633
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
is the magnet.

634
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The reason why

635
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the magnetic field

636
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and the magnetic field

637
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
are similar is that

638
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
if you zoom in

639
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and see what the electrons

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
are doing,

641
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
each electron has

642
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
a magnetic field.

643
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This magnetic field

644
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
is like a magnet.

645
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can imagine

646
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
these spins

647
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
as if there is

648
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
a small arrow

649
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in the electron,

650
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and these arrows

651
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
point from the south

652
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to the north.

653
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So,

654
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the magnet has this kind

655
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
of magnetic field.

656
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The symmetry

657
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
of the magnet

658
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is that

659
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
these small arrows

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
cannot rotate at will.

661
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If it is not in a magnet,

662
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
these small arrows

663
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
can rotate at will

664
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
in the electron.

665
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It does not have to

666
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
point in the same direction,

667
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but because it is

668
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
in a magnet,

669
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
each small arrow

670
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
has to point in the same direction.

671
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This is symmetry destruction.

672
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Another example

673
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
is this picture.

674
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What is this?

675
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is a

676
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
experimental picture.

677
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They used

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
a very small

679
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
carbon needle

680
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
to scan the surface

681
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
of the material.

682
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This is the picture they obtained.

683
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know if you can see it,

684
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
but there are

685
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
little white things here.

686
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Those little white things are atoms.

687
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But you can also see

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
a relatively large amount

689
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
of lines.

690
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This tells us

691
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that if the material

692
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
is clean enough,

693
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the size of the atom

694
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is much smaller than the lines.

695
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But we can see

696
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
a wave-shaped

697
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
line.

698
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This is a

699
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
quantum state.

700
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This quantum state

701
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
destroys

702
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
the symmetry

703
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of the material.

704
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
This is

705
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
a translational symmetry.

706
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Those are

707
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
two different examples.

708
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Now,

709
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
let's talk about superconductivity.

710
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Superconductivity is

711
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
also an example.

712
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Superconductivity is

713
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
an interesting quantum state.

714
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
As we all know,

715
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
superconductivity

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is a perfect

717
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
conductor.

718
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Its resistance R is zero.

719
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If you can

720
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
make a wire

721
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
with superconductivity,

722
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the wire will not heat up

723
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because there will be no damage.

724
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can pass the wire

725
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
from one end to the other

726
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
without any damage.

727
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is superconductivity.

728
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There is another

729
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
characteristic of superconductivity.

730
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It does not like magnetic field.

731
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is called Meissner effect.

732
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Superconductivity

733
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
is a perfect conductor

734
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and it rejects.

735
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
These characteristics

736
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
can only occur at a very low temperature.

737
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Otherwise, most of the

738
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
wires are made with superconductivity.

739
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because the temperature

740
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
must be low enough.

741
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is

742
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
why a very popular

743
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
research topic

744
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
is to find out

745
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
if there is superconductivity at room temperature.

746
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let me

747
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
show you

748
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
what I mean

749
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
when I say superconductivity is zero.

750
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let's say this material

751
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is a superconductor.

752
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You add a current

753
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to it

754
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to measure

755
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
its voltage difference.

756
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Then you can get superconductivity.

757
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If it is

758
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
a superconductor,

759
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
when you lower the temperature,

760
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
it will

761
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
suddenly become zero

762
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
at room temperature.

763
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
However, if it is

764
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
a non-superconducting metal,

765
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
its voltage

766
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
will only

767
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
decrease but not reach zero.

768
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is the special feature of superconductivity.

769
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is

770
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
a practical example. This is a ball.

771
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
When the ball is at a low temperature,

772
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
it will also become superconductive.

773
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So

774
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
we just said that

775
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
there are two

776
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
important properties of superconductivity.

777
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
One of them is

778
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that its resistance will be zero.

779
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But what happened

780
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to the superconductor

781
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
when it became zero?

782
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In fact,

783
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I just showed you this picture.

784
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This is a gold bar.

785
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The black part

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is the atom.

787
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The atom is moving around the atom.

788
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You can imagine

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that the two atoms are moving around

790
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and interacting with each other.

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There are a lot of atoms.

792
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What happened in the superconductor

793
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is that

794
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the atom and the atom

795
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
decide not to

796
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
move separately.

797
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They want to

798
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
move hand in hand

799
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and group by group

800
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
in the gold bar.

801
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So

802
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
they will form

803
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
an electron-bound state.

804
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This kind of electron-bound state

805
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
is called Cooper pairs.

806
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The reason why they are willing to do this

807
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
instead of individual electron-bound states

808
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
is because

809
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
this is less energy for them.

810
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So

811
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
when they form

812
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
this pair of Cooper pairs,

813
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
all these Cooper pairs

814
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
do the same thing

815
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
together.

816
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This is because of the quantum mechanics.

817
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So these Cooper pairs

818
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
do not move

819
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
one to this side

820
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and the other to that side.

821
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They all do the same thing.

822
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So

823
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
they do not collide with each other

824
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and cause damage.

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
This is why there is no electron-bound state.

826
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because all these Cooper pairs

827
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
are moving in the same direction.

828
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
They do not collide

829
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and cause damage.

830
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And

831
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
if we want to

832
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
look at them from the perspective of symmetry destruction,

833
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
because electrons

834
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
can form this kind of

835
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
pair of electrons,

836
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but they can also

837
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
destroy these pair of electrons at any time.

838
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So from this perspective,

839
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
the number of electrons is irregular.

840
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
OK, so

841
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I just gave you three examples

842
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
to see

843
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
how to use symmetry destruction

844
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
to understand the collective behavior

845
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
of electrons.

846
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But this theory is not perfect.

847
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
In the experiment,

848
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
we gradually found that

849
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
although some systems have the same symmetry,

850
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
although they have different symmetries,

851
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
some of their

852
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
observational phenomena are exactly the same.

853
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then there are other examples

854
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that their symmetries are different,

855
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
but

856
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
their symmetries are the same,

857
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but their material properties

858
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
are very different.

859
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So this means that

860
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
symmetry destruction

861
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
is not the only

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
tool we should

863
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
use to understand

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the collective behavior of electrons.

865
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It seems that

866
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
we still need other new ways to distinguish them.

867
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
In the past

868
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
40 years,

869
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
actually,

870
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
30 years,

871
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
we have learned that

872
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
symmetry destruction

873
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is not the only

874
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
tool we should

875
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
use to understand

876
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the collective behavior of electrons.

877
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
In the past 30 years,

878
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
physicists have learned that

879
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
symmetry destruction

880
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
is a very important concept

881
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in mathematics.

882
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
By using symmetry destruction

883
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
to understand materials and physics,

884
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
we have made a lot of progress

885
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in understanding materials.

886
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
In 2016,

887
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the Nobel Prize for Physics

888
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
was awarded to

889
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Thorpe material.

890
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Thorpe material

891
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
was used to understand materials.

892
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Here,

893
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I would like to

894
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
use the simplest way

895
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
to explain what Thorpe is.

896
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because this word

897
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
looks quite unfamiliar.

898
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
After all, it is a translation word.

899
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
In English, it is called topology.

900
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
In mathematics,

901
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Thorpe is a very

902
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
large field.

903
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
However, when we use it to understand

904
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
materials,

905
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
we only use some of the concepts.

906
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Now, I will give you

907
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the simplest example

908
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
that I hope you can understand.

909
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So,

910
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
let's not look at materials.

911
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Let's go back to what Thorpe is

912
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in mathematics.

913
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
First,

914
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
let's get out of the reality.

915
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Let's use a more abstract way

916
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to think about it.

917
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Let's say I have two spaces.

918
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The blue space is my base space.

919
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The red space is my target space.

920
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Let's say

921
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the blue space

922
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
is a circular path.

923
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Let's say

924
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the blue space

925
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is a circular path.

926
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The other space

927
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
is a point.

928
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It is a point

929
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that can rotate on a plane.

930
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The point

931
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
can rotate

932
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
from 0 to 360 degrees.

933
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Let's say

934
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I define these two spaces.

935
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I can ask

936
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
what is the

937
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
one-to-one relationship

938
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
between these two spaces.

939
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What does it mean?

940
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's say

941
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
each point

942
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
has a point.

943
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What is the

944
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
pattern of this point?

945
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I am asking

946
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
what is the angle

947
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
of each point.

948
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What is the direction

949
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
of each point?

950
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What is the possibility?

951
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Let's look at

952
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the first example.

953
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Let's say

954
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I put a arrow

955
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
on each point.

956
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
In this example,

957
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
when I turn around

958
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and ask how the arrow rotates,

959
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
you can see

960
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
each arrow rotates a little bit,

961
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but not much.

962
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This situation

963
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
is totally different

964
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
from this situation.

965
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
In this situation,

966
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
when you walk around

967
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the circle,

968
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the arrow rotates 360 degrees,

969
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
which means

970
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the arrow rotates a full circle.

971
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
In this example,

972
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
when you walk around

973
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the circle,

974
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the arrow rotates

975
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
two times.

976
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Theoretically,

977
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if you continue

978
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to walk around

979
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the blue circle,

980
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
you can walk around

981
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the whole circle

982
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and not only this.

983
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You can walk around

984
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the whole circle

985
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and not only this.

986
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
In this example,

987
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
you can use

988
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
a winding number

989
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to describe

990
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
the rotation of

991
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the red arrow.

992
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The winding number

993
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
is the number

994
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
of the circle

995
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
of the circle.

996
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The winding number

997
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
is the number

998
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
of the circle

999
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
of the circle.

1000
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Or you can imagine

1001
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the winding number

1002
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
as a label

1003
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to mark

1004
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the different situations.

1005
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Or you can imagine

1006
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the winding number

1007
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
as a label

1008
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to mark

1009
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the different situations.

1010
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Or you can imagine

1011
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
the winding number

1012
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
as a label

1013
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
to mark

1014
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
the different situations.

1015
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Now you can ask

1016
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
how to apply

1017
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
the mathematical definition

1018
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
on the materials

1019
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and how to find

1020
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the rotation of

1021
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the arrow

1022
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The answer is

1023
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
usually the blue space

1024
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
is the kinetic space of the arrow

1025
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
so it is related to

1026
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the kinetic space of the arrow.

1027
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The red space

1028
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
is the

1029
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
position of the electric wave function.

1030
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
For those who don't know

1031
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
what is the electric wave function

1032
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you can imagine

1033
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the position of the electric wave function

1034
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
as

1035
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
each arrow

1036
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
points to a small bell

1037
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and the bell

1038
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
has a red arrow

1039
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
with only 10 arrows.

1040
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You can imagine

1041
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the arrow

1042
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
points to

1043
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the different directions

1044
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
on the bell

1045
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
so you can imagine

1046
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the bell

1047
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
as the bell.

1048
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is similar to the example

1049
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I showed you

1050
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The arrow

1051
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
points to the

1052
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
different directions

1053
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
on the bell

1054
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and the bell

1055
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
has a red arrow

1056
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
with only 10 arrows.

1057
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I have just

1058
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
explained

1059
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the meaning of

1060
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the elliptic

1061
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and how to define

1062
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the elliptic

1063
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
in the materials.

1064
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Is it because

1065
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the elliptic has a special nature?

1066
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Even though

1067
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the elliptic

1068
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
has a special nature,

1069
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
if the

1070
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
experiment

1071
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
doesn't show

1072
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
the elliptic,

1073
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
it is just a

1074
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
definition of the elliptic.

1075
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The answer is

1076
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
the elliptic

1077
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
has a special nature

1078
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
when the

1079
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
elliptic

1080
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
points to the

1081
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
different directions

1082
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
on the bell.

1083
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What does it mean?

1084
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me give you

1085
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
a famous example.

1086
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It is called

1087
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
integer quantum Hall effect.

1088
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
What does it mean?

1089
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Let's take

1090
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
a metal or

1091
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
a semiconductor film

1092
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and measure the

1093
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
cross section

1094
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of the current I

1095
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
with the

1096
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
current V

1097
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and the

1098
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
current I.

1099
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
If you take

1100
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the ratio of

1101
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
V and I,

1102
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
you can get

1103
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
the Hall resistance

1104
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
rho h.

1105
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
If the experiment

1106
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
is done at room temperature,

1107
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
many materials

1108
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and physics

1109
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
do the experiment

1110
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
at the university.

1111
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You can ask

1112
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
how the Hall resistance

1113
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
changes with the

1114
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
size of the magnetic field.

1115
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I can tell you

1116
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it is a linear change.

1117
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The bigger the magnetic field,

1118
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
the bigger the Hall resistance.

1119
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
However,

1120
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
if you do the experiment

1121
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
at low temperature,

1122
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
you will find

1123
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the result is very different.

1124
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
As the magnetic field

1125
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
gets bigger,

1126
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you can see

1127
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the curve is like a step.

1128
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What's more,

1129
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
we call it

1130
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
quantized plateaus.

1131
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It is one step at a time.

1132
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What's more,

1133
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
if you look at

1134
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the value

1135
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
of Hall resistance,

1136
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
you will find

1137
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it is

1138
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
one over

1139
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
a whole number.

1140
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is the amazing part.

1141
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
This part,

1142
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
h over e squared,

1143
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
is a universal constant.

1144
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It is just a value.

1145
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You can think of it as a fixed number,

1146
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
26kΩ.

1147
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
However,

1148
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
this part, one over c,

1149
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
tells you c is a whole number.

1150
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
In other words,

1151
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
if you read its value,

1152
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
it is 26 divided by 2,

1153
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
which is 13.

1154
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Similarly,

1155
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
26 divided by 3, 26 divided by 4, etc.

1156
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Why is it amazing?

1157
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The amazing result

1158
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
is because

1159
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
people found

1160
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
different experiments

1161
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
from different people

1162
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
to get the same result.

1163
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
However,

1164
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the result is exactly the same.

1165
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The value is

1166
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
exactly

1167
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
negative 9 times of 10.

1168
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So,

1169
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
it is very strange.

1170
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
These values

1171
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
become

1172
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
the common unit

1173
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
of quantum mechanics

1174
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
in the end.

1175
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So,

1176
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
it is very amazing.

1177
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
In 1982,

1178
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
a quantum theorist

1179
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
found that

1180
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the reason behind this result

1181
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
is that

1182
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the electron

1183
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
goes around

1184
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
2, 3, 4, etc.

1185
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So,

1186
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
the result is

1187
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
exactly the same.

1188
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
However,

1189
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't have time

1190
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
to explain

1191
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
why it is so.

1192
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So, this is the first

1193
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
characteristic of top material,

1194
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
which is that

1195
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the conductor

1196
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is the value of

1197
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
the whole number.

1198
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The second

1199
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
interesting characteristic is that

1200
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
if

1201
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
this square

1202
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
is a two-dimensional

1203
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
top material,

1204
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
we can find that

1205
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
there is an electron

1206
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
going along the same direction

1207
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
on the edge of the sample.

1208
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So,

1209
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
these electrons

1210
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
just sit on the edge of the sample.

1211
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
There is no electron inside.

1212
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Moreover,

1213
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
they go along the same direction.

1214
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So,

1215
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
this characteristic

1216
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
can be seen

1217
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
in almost all

1218
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
top materials.

1219
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So, this is the second interesting characteristic.

1220
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So,

1221
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
after the whole number

1222
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
quantum Hall effect,

1223
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
we found that

1224
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
it is not just a wave model.

1225
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
In fact, many metals,

1226
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
semiconductors, or solvents

1227
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
can have top characteristics,

1228
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
which means that

1229
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
they all have the transmission characteristics of the whole number,

1230
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and they all have electron flow on the edge.

1231
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Now, I want to ask a question.

1232
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
How can I define a top superconductor?

1233
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That is to say,

1234
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
when electrons form a qubit like this

1235
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
at low temperature,

1236
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
in the case of

1237
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
a two-dimensional qubit,

1238
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
can I also have a top characteristic?

1239
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The answer is of course yes.

1240
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So,

1241
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
let me give you a definition first.

1242
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That is to say,

1243
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
how do I define a top superconductor

1244
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
according to the definition

1245
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
we just explained?

1246
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
All the important information

1247
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
related to the superconductor

1248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is hidden

1249
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
in the

1250
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
kinetic energy of an electron itself,

1251
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and when it

1252
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
forms

1253
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
a qubit,

1254
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
what is its wave function?

1255
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, simply put,

1256
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
if you want to describe a superconductor,

1257
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
any superconductor,

1258
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
basically what you care about is

1259
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
what is its kinetic energy before it forms a qubit,

1260
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and what is its wave function

1261
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
after it forms a qubit.

1262
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
As long as you know these two things,

1263
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
you can basically understand

1264
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
most of the

1265
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
properties of a superconductor.

1266
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So,

1267
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
using those two things,

1268
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
the kinetic energy of a single electron

1269
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and the wave function of a qubit,

1270
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
these two quantities,

1271
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
C and Δ,

1272
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I can construct

1273
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
a three-dimensional superconductor.

1274
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm just showing it off,

1275
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but you don't really need to understand it.

1276
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
In short, it's a superconductor

1277
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
constructed by those two quantities.

1278
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
From this superconductor,

1279
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I can play the game I just played,

1280
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
construct and define

1281
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
two different spaces.

1282
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The first space is still

1283
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the kinetic energy of an electron,

1284
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
but the second space

1285
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
is not just a qubit,

1286
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
but a three-dimensional superconductor

1287
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
because it's a three-dimensional superconductor.

1288
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So you can imagine

1289
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
it's just a qubit,

1290
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and it can rotate

1291
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in a three-dimensional space.

1292
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I can ask

1293
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
if there is

1294
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
a circle

1295
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
between these two spaces.

1296
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You can imagine

1297
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
this

1298
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
three-dimensional

1299
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
superconductor space

1300
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
is a qubit,

1301
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and it can rotate

1302
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
in a three-dimensional space.

1303
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's pretty much it.

1304
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
There is a very famous example,

1305
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
which is

1306
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
a P-wave superconductor.

1307
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
If you have

1308
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
heard of

1309
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
related physics,

1310
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
or know more about

1311
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
related physics,

1312
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
this is a famous example.

1313
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
What is the thing

1314
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
that rotates here?

1315
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's the wave function of

1316
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the cooper pair.

1317
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You can see it's rotating around

1318
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
on its qubit.

1319
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Another important property is

1320
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
that in this special

1321
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
superconductor,

1322
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
the magnetic field

1323
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
of the electron

1324
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
must be the same

1325
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
as the magnetic field

1326
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
of the qubit.

1327
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's a Pauli Exclusion Principle.

1328
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Statistics

1329
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
must be the same.

1330
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
OK.

1331
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Next, let's ask

1332
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
what properties does this superconductor have?

1333
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Here comes the important part.

1334
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Remember

1335
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the second type of

1336
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
superconductor properties I mentioned?

1337
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Is there electromagnetic flow

1338
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
on the boundary of the sample?

1339
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
In the

1340
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
semiconductor,

1341
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
we can say

1342
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
there is electromagnetic flow

1343
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
on the boundary of the sample.

1344
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But in the superconductor,

1345
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you can still find something

1346
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
on the boundary of the sample.

1347
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But the special example

1348
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
is not an ordinary electron.

1349
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's a special example

1350
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
called Majorana.

1351
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So it is

1352
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
only on the boundary of the sample.

1353
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
But how special is it?

1354
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
The special thing is

1355
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
it is the same

1356
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
as its antiparticle.

1357
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It is a special example

1358
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
of antiparticle.

1359
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
OK.

1360
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
These are some examples.

1361
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
For example,

1362
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
if you have a 1-dimensional superconductor,

1363
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you can find Majorana particle

1364
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
on the boundary of

1365
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
the 2-dimensional superconductor.

1366
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It is 0-dimensional.

1367
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
If you have a gray 2-dimensional

1368
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
superconductor,

1369
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you can find a 1-dimensional

1370
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Majorana mole

1371
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
on the boundary.

1372
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If you have a 3-dimensional superconductor,

1373
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
you can find a 2-dimensional

1374
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Majorana mole

1375
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
on the surface of

1376
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
the 3-dimensional superconductor.

1377
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But what I want to emphasize today

1378
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
is that in this 2-dimensional example,

1379
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
there is an additional place

1380
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
where you can find Majorana mole.

1381
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That is to say,

1382
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
if the magnetic field

1383
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
penetrates the superconductor,

1384
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
you will form a lot of curvatures.

1385
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That is to say,

1386
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor.

1387
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
In the middle of these curvatures,

1388
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
you can also find

1389
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
a 0-dimensional Majorana mole.

1390
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
OK.

1391
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Then,

1392
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
when this kind of

1393
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
2-dimensional superconductor

1394
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
is 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional,

1395
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
people are particularly

1396
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
interested in it.

1397
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Because it has quantum computing

1398
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
as a possible application.

1399
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
If we want to talk about quantum computing,

1400
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
we have to focus on

1401
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
this 0-dimensional Majorana mole.

1402
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So it is 0-dimensional and energy is 0.

1403
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We call it Majorana zero mole.

1404
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
There are a lot of

1405
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
research shows that

1406
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
it is proposed that

1407
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
using

1408
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
the curvature

1409
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
generated by the magnetic field

1410
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I just mentioned

1411
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
to form the Majorana mole,

1412
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
to form the so-called qubit.

1413
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The qubit is

1414
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
the qubit in quantum computing.

1415
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So what is a qubit?

1416
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
In a traditional computer,

1417
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
in a traditional computer,

1418
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
we know that there are a lot of 0s and 1s, right?

1419
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Then the qubit

1420
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
is the thing

1421
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
0 and 1

1422
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
corresponding to the quantum computer.

1423
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But it is no longer

1424
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
just 0 and 1.

1425
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
There are different numbers.

1426
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But I don't have time

1427
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
to go into that part.

1428
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So I will

1429
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
mention

1430
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
what are the benefits

1431
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
of using the Turp superconverter

1432
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to do quantum computing.

1433
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Why do we have to use the Turp superconverter?

1434
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The advantage of using the Turp superconverter

1435
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to do quantum computing is

1436
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
quantum computing

1437
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
has always been

1438
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
a possible problem that everyone cares about.

1439
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
For example,

1440
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
if you put a quantum computer

1441
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
in an environment,

1442
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
it can do

1443
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
very powerful calculations,

1444
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
but due to environmental impact,

1445
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
it will still be affected by the environment,

1446
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
so it will lead to errors in the calculation.

1447
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And if the error rate

1448
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is too high,

1449
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
quantum computing will not be established.

1450
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But if you use

1451
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
the Turp superconverter

1452
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
as the material

1453
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
to do quantum computing,

1454
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
this qubit,

1455
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
the smallest computing unit,

1456
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
is not

1457
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
in the same place.

1458
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Instead,

1459
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I can take two

1460
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
relatively distant currents

1461
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and the Mariana Zero Mode

1462
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
as a qubit.

1463
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
In other words,

1464
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
if I have some

1465
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
local noise

1466
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
in this environment,

1467
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it will not destroy

1468
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
the information in this qubit.

1469
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because I can't

1470
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
affect the two Mariana Zero Mode

1471
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
at the same time.

1472
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I usually only affect one side,

1473
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
but not the other side.

1474
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
In this case,

1475
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you have to affect

1476
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
both sides at the same time

1477
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
to affect the calculation.

1478
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So this is why

1479
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
everyone says that

1480
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
using the Turp superconverter

1481
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
is the best way

1482
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
to do quantum computing.

1483
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It is also a way

1484
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
to do quantum computing

1485
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
with higher convergence rate.

1486
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Finally,

1487
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I want to say

1488
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that it sounds pretty good,

1489
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
right?

1490
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
If there is a Turp superconverter,

1491
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
we can use it

1492
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
to build a quantum computer.

1493
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Why haven't I heard about it?

1494
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
The reason is

1495
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
what kind of material

1496
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
is a Turp superconverter?

1497
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The answer is

1498
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
almost none.

1499
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
In other words,

1500
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the existence of a Turp superconverter

1501
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
is actually a quantum material

1502
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that has been predicted

1503
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
by theory.

1504
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But what kind of

1505
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
actual material

1506
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
is a Turp superconverter?

1507
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Then you can find

1508
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the Mariana Zero Mode in it.

1509
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
This is a big problem.

1510
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Although there are

1511
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
a lot of papers

1512
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
claiming that

1513
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
they have seen

1514
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
the Mariana Zero Mode

1515
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
in their system,

1516
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think it's fair to say

1517
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
that our community

1518
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
can't really

1519
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
have an experiment

1520
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
that is very confident

1521
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
that they have

1522
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
seen a Mariana qubit

1523
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
in their system.

1524
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I think this is

1525
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
a direction that

1526
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
we are still working on.

1527
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Although I don't have

1528
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
enough time now,

1529
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I will mention

1530
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that my research

1531
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
is to use

1532
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
various different

1533
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
theories to find

1534
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
different strategies

1535
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and systematic recipes

1536
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
to predict

1537
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
a Turp superconverter.

1538
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Theoretically, after making

1539
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
such a prediction,

1540
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I will make a proposal

1541
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to my experiment partners

1542
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
hoping that they can

1543
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
really find the material

1544
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and verify whether

1545
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
the material is really

1546
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
a Turp superconverter.

1547
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
In the last few minutes,

1548
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
let me give you

1549
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
one or two examples.

1550
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
For example,

1551
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you don't need to know

1552
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
what it is.

1553
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I just want to emphasize

1554
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that this material

1555
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
caused a stir

1556
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
20 years ago.

1557
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
People think

1558
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
this should be a Turp superconverter

1559
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
because many of its properties

1560
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
look like a Turp superconverter.

1561
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But in fact,

1562
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
the Mariana Zero Mode

1563
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
in the nest was not seen.

1564
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Later, it should be a few years ago,

1565
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
people found that

1566
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
some experiments were wrong.

1567
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
In fact, this kind of superconverter

1568
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
is not a Turp superconverter.

1569
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It is not a Turp superconverter,

1570
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and it must be

1571
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
a superconverter

1572
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
at a very low temperature.

1573
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
These are the shortcomings of this material.

1574
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
In the past,

1575
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
we proposed

1576
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that experiments

1577
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
should be able to pull

1578
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
or push it,

1579
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
or grow it

1580
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
on a mold of different sizes

1581
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
in an experimental way,

1582
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
so that its size

1583
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
is extended or compressed.

1584
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
In this way,

1585
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
my collaborators

1586
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
can see

1587
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
some experimental pictures,

1588
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
but I just want to tell you

1589
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that you can see

1590
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
the quality of the material

1591
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
can be greatly changed

1592
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
by pulling

1593
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
or compressing it.

1594
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
In theory,

1595
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
we can predict

1596
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
that when it is pulled

1597
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
or compressed to some extent,

1598
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
this material

1599
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
can be easier to become a Turp superconverter,

1600
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and its temperature

1601
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
will also increase.

1602
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So this is

1603
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
an example of what we did

1604
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
in the past.

1605
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
There are some other works,

1606
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
but I may not have time to mention today,

1607
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
so I will only show you

1608
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
this cover image.

1609
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
We have done various works,

1610
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and the first example

1611
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
is that

1612
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
we proposed

1613
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
how to design

1614
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
the material

1615
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
so that the query of the Kubernetes

1616
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
is in the same direction.

1617
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
In this way,

1618
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
it is easier to get a Turp superconverter.

1619
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Another way

1620
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
is to introduce different

1621
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
symmetries

1622
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
to make the material

1623
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
have the Marana Zero Mode.

1624
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We also did

1625
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
other things,

1626
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
such as using math to

1627
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
deduce some Turp invariants,

1628
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and then using

1629
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
machine learning

1630
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
to systematically

1631
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
go through

1632
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the database

1633
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
with

1634
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
thousands of materials.

1635
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It is difficult

1636
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
to find

1637
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
the Turp superconverter

1638
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
directly,

1639
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but by using

1640
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
the Turp invariants

1641
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
or machine learning,

1642
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
we can systematically

1643
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
find which materials

1644
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
are more likely.

1645
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I don't have time

1646
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
to talk about these details today,

1647
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
so I will stop here.

1648
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
If you have any questions,

1649
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
please feel free to ask.

1650
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
If you have any questions,

1651
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
please feel free to ask.

1652
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
If you add a magnetic field,

1653
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you can create

1654
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
a vortex.

1655
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes, the magnetic field

1656
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
cannot be too large.

1657
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
If the magnetic field is too large,

1658
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the superconverter will be

1659
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
rejected,

1660
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and the magnetic field

1661
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
will destroy the superconverter.

1662
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So we are talking about

1663
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
a magnetic field

1664
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
smaller than the critical B field

1665
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
to create a vortex

1666
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Okay, I see.

1667
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Thank you.

1668
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hello.

1669
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I am teaching

1670
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
at Chengda Electronics.

1671
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I started

1672
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
doing quantum computing

1673
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
around April this year.

1674
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
To be honest,

1675
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I have studied

1676
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
modern physics,

1677
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and the physics I just mentioned

1678
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
are too profound for me.

1679
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I would like to know

1680
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
from the perspective

1681
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
of physicists,

1682
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that is,

1683
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
if we want to do

1684
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
image processing,

1685
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
the special point

1686
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
of image processing

1687
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
is that we can take

1688
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
a picture of millions of pixels.

1689
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
In other words,

1690
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
even if we only need

1691
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
8 bits for a pixel,

1692
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I may need

1693
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
8 million bits, right?

1694
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
For a quantum computer,

1695
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
it may be 8 million bits.

1696
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
8 million qubits.

1697
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
In the case of IBM's

1698
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
more powerful quantum computer,

1699
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
it may only have

1700
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
about 80 bits.

1701
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I would like to know

1702
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that physicists think

1703
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that the difference in the number

1704
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
of qubits,

1705
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
if we want to break through

1706
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
an order, for example,

1707
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
to make it 10 times,

1708
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
for example,

1709
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
from 80 to 800 qubits,

1710
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
how can we make

1711
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
a breakthrough?

1712
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I think this is

1713
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
a very good question.

1714
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Now,

1715
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
various companies

1716
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
have their own

1717
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
favorite physical system.

1718
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
For example,

1719
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Google has its own,

1720
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
IBM has its own,

1721
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and Microsoft has its own.

1722
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So the method I'm talking about

1723
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
is the method

1724
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
of quantum computing.

1725
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Its advantage is that

1726
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I don't know

1727
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
their actual experiment.

1728
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Now they are

1729
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
very serious about

1730
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
this project,

1731
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
so I don't know

1732
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
their current progress.

1733
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But I can tell you

1734
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
that this path,

1735
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
topological quantum computing,

1736
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
its advantage is

1737
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
that it is very small.

1738
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That is to say,

1739
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
the size of these vortexes

1740
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
can be very close.

1741
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Then it can be very small

1742
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
compared to other methods,

1743
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
such as IBM's method.

1744
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So it has a way to scale up.

1745
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That is to say,

1746
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
when they have a way

1747
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
to make a qubit,

1748
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
in theory,

1749
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
they have the potential

1750
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
to make more

1751
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
qubits.

1752
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
In addition,

1753
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm not

1754
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
an expert

1755
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
in quantum computing algorithms,

1756
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
but in theory,

1757
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
if it is

1758
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
more fault tolerant,

1759
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
you don't need

1760
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
many physical qubits

1761
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
to make

1762
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
a real qubit.

1763
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So this is

1764
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
the potential

1765
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I can see

1766
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
in quantum computing.

1767
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But I don't know

1768
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
whether it can be done

1769
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
in 5 to 10 years.

1770
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But I think there is a chance.

1771
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Otherwise, these big companies

1772
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
wouldn't invest so much

1773
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
effort, right?

1774
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
They are doing this

1775
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
very seriously now.

1776
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I have a second question.

1777
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's also

1778
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
from my research.

1779
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We have a big problem

1780
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
with quantum computing.

1781
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Quantum computing has

1782
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
an uncopyability.

1783
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
When we want to

1784
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
measure a qubit,

1785
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
we can only measure it once,

1786
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and the quantum state

1787
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
is gone.

1788
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We wanted to

1789
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
find a solution.

1790
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Then I asked

1791
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
a teacher

1792
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
who makes materials.

1793
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
He said a very

1794
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
well-known

1795
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
supercomputer

1796
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
can be used to

1797
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
measure a qubit,

1798
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and the quantum state

1799
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
is gone.

1800
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm not sure

1801
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
if there is

1802
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
any real

1803
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
experimental evidence

1804
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
in your field,

1805
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
or

1806
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
if you haven't

1807
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
heard of it.

1808
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Actually, I don't know

1809
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
the theory of supercomputing.

1810
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I need to read

1811
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
the article.

1812
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Otherwise,

1813
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I don't know

1814
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
what it means.

1815
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But this is

1816
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
a problem.

1817
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I can imagine

1818
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
when you do the measurement,

1819
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
it collapses to a state.

1820
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Maybe there is a way

1821
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
to reconstruct

1822
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the original state.

1823
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I've heard

1824
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
some talks

1825
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
trying to do this

1826
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
with machine learning.

1827
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That's right.

1828
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But

1829
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
we can

1830
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
discuss it later.

1831
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We can discuss it

1832
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
offline.

1833
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I think what Mr. Xu said

1834
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
is right.

1835
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
We found that

1836
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
we have to use machine learning.

1837
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That's something

1838
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
we did recently.

1839
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
We used deep learning

1840
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
to solve it.

1841
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But I think

1842
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
physicists may need

1843
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
to solve

1844
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
these two problems.

1845
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I think these are

1846
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
the two bottlenecks.

1847
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Interesting.

1848
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
We can discuss it later.

1849
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Thank you.

1850
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Hello.

1851
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Please go ahead.

1852
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I can't

1853
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
turn on

1854
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
the camera.

1855
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So I will

1856
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
speak directly.

1857
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I'm a professor at

1858
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
the Department of Mass Physics.

1859
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
My name is Gao Xianzhong.

1860
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I have a question.

1861
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Someone asked

1862
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
if you are a

1863
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
topological superconductor

1864
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and

1865
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
you are a type 2 superconductor

1866
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and you add a magnetic field,

1867
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
there may be

1868
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
a zero-dimension

1869
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
marinara mode

1870
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
near the

1871
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
vortex core.

1872
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I want to ask

1873
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
that

1874
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
in general,

1875
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
in many cases,

1876
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
when you add a magnetic field,

1877
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
it doesn't

1878
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
form a single flux core.

1879
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
For example,

1880
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
it may form

1881
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
a Bricose-off-Lattice.

1882
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
There will be many cores.

1883
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yes.

1884
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Are these

1885
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
cores

1886
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
equal to

1887
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
the magnetic field

1888
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
on the material

1889
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
divided by the magnetic field of the unit?

1890
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
This is a good question.

1891
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I haven't

1892
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
thought about it.

1893
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It sounds reasonable.

1894
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
We can discuss the details later.

1895
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I want to

1896
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
emphasize that

1897
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I only draw one here,

1898
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
but if it is

1899
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
an application like

1900
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
quantum computing,

1901
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
it really needs a lot.

1902
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Because it is

1903
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
a pair of

1904
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
vortex plus

1905
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
a zero-dimension

1906
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
marinara mode.

1907
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It is not

1908
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
a single thing.

1909
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Of course, we don't

1910
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
only need one core.

1911
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
We need many cores.

1912
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I think

1913
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the question you just asked

1914
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
is very important.

1915
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
If we need many cores,

1916
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
we need to know

1917
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
the size of the material

1918
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and the magnetic field.

1919
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I haven't thought about it.

1920
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I can't answer you

1921
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
precisely now.

1922
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We can talk about it later.

1923
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Let me

1924
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
ask the question in the chat.

1925
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Hello, I am Xiong Weiren.

1926
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I am currently doing research

1927
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
in the Central Academy of Medicine.

1928
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It is said that electrons

1929
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
have the same

1930
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
mode of action

1931
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
at extremely low temperature,

1932
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
such as superconductivity.

1933
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But what is the direction

1934
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
of superconductivity

1935
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
at room temperature?

1936
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Let me

1937
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
try to understand

1938
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
your question.

1939
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
What I said

1940
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
at the beginning

1941
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
is that

1942
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
in fact,

1943
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
there are several modes

1944
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
of action at extremely low temperature,

1945
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
such as superconductivity

1946
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
or magnetism.

1947
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Or the charge density wave

1948
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I just showed you.

1949
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Electrons will

1950
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
show the pattern

1951
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
of the beam.

1952
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
There are several patterns.

1953
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
One of them is superconductivity.

1954
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But we can ask

1955
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
what is the nature of superconductivity?

1956
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Is it helpful

1957
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in application?

1958
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
The answer is that it has no damage,

1959
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
so it is very good.

1960
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
We hope to apply it

1961
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
to our daily life,

1962
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
such as various appliances

1963
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
or wires,

1964
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
right?

1965
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
That's why people want to

1966
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
ask if there is superconductivity

1967
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
at room temperature.

1968
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Is there any way to see

1969
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
superconductivity at room temperature?

1970
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's the motivation.

1971
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But you can ask

1972
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
if there is

1973
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
actually a way to do it.

1974
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Recently,

1975
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
many articles

1976
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
are trying to

1977
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
say that they have seen

1978
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
superconductivity at room temperature,

1979
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
but there are some controversies.

1980
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
The general principle

1981
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
is that you have to add a lot of pressure.

1982
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
There must be a trade-off.

1983
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You can see it

1984
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
at low temperature,

1985
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
or you can see it

1986
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
at room temperature,

1987
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
but you have to add a lot of pressure.

1988
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's what I've heard so far.

1989
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Of course,

1990
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
there are some famous examples,

1991
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
such as the so-called high-temperature superconductor,

1992
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
which is also

1993
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
negative 200 degrees C.

1994
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's still very low-temperature,

1995
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
but it's over 100 degrees higher

1996
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
than the original one.

1997
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This kind of high-temperature superconductor

1998
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
relies on the progress of the material.

1999
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That is to say, they make

2000
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
some copper-based superconductors.

2001
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It's obviously a ceramic material.

2002
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It should be insoluble,

2003
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
but at low temperature,

2004
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
at minus 200 degrees,

2005
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
it may become a superconductor.

2006
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Another direction

2007
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
is to understand

2008
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
such a feature,

2009
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
which is a high-temperature superconductor,

2010
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
its surrounding physical mechanism,

2011
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and then

2012
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
to find out

2013
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
if the surrounding physical mechanism

2014
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
can amplify the behavior

2015
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
in different material families.

2016
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Some people also pursue

2017
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
this kind of logic

2018
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
to see if there is any way

2019
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
to make other materials at room temperature,

2020
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
without adding a lot of pressure.

2021
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I hope I have answered your question.

2022
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Thank you, Mr. Xu,

2023
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
for your wonderful speech.

2024
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Is there any other material

2025
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
that may not be a superconductor?

2026
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
For example,

2027
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
double-layered stainless steel?

2028
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Hello?

2029
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Can you hear me?

2030
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Yes, yes, yes.

2031
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
You can talk about the last part.

2032
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Does it stop at double-layered stainless steel?

2033
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
For example,

2034
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
double-layered stainless steel?

2035
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh, I see.

2036
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Is it possible that

2037
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
double-layered stainless steel

2038
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
is a candidate?

2039
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yes, yes, it is possible.

2040
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
That's a good question.

2041
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Double-layered stainless steel

2042
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
is a very popular material recently.

2043
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It is a double-layered stainless steel.

2044
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It can actually be done.

2045
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Then they will turn it

2046
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
in a small angle.

2047
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
The reason is that

2048
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
it can be used to

2049
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
control the interaction between

2050
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
electrons and electrons,

2051
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
or the size of the interaction

2052
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
between the two.

2053
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
If the interaction is more effective,

2054
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
the superconductor

2055
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
can have

2056
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
all kinds of different

2057
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
quantum states.

2058
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
One of them is the superconductor.

2059
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It has not been fully

2060
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
confirmed yet,

2061
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
but many theories,

2062
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
including some of my own work,

2063
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
predict that

2064
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
in such a system,

2065
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
when you have some

2066
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
parameters on the material,

2067
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
how to adjust them,

2068
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
it is indeed possible that it is a top superconductor.

2069
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So this is possible.

2070
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Some of my past work

2071
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
has also predicted

2072
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
a lot of double-layered materials

2073
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
similar to stainless steel,

2074
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
like the hexagonal material just now,

2075
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
where each atom is not

2076
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
carbon, but some other

2077
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
transition metal, etc.

2078
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
There are some other

2079
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
atoms in the cycle table.

2080
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
If you put it there,

2081
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
it is another type of

2082
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
transition metal that can be

2083
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
collagenized.

2084
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Those can also be

2085
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
torn apart layer by layer

2086
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
with 3M tape.

2087
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I have some work to predict

2088
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
that it may also be a superconductor.

2089
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay.

2090
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Next question.

2091
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Hello, I am Hong Shi-An.

2092
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I am currently doing my PhD at NIST.

2093
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Since I have not studied

2094
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
topological quantum

2095
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
QC, quantum computing,

2096
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I would like to ask

2097
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
which two states

2098
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
can be used

2099
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
as 0 and 1?

2100
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Why can it be immutable

2101
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
to localized noise?

2102
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
This is a big question.

2103
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
For more details,

2104
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I can recommend

2105
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
a very good

2106
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
review article

2107
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
called Review of Modern Physics

2108
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
by RMP.

2109
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
In general,

2110
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
it is not only

2111
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
0 and 1.

2112
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Generally,

2113
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
it does not have to be

2114
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
topological quantum computing.

2115
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
As long as it is quantum computing,

2116
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
it uses a quantum state

2117
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
to store information.

2118
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
In the quantum state,

2119
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
it is not

2120
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
100%

2121
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
or 1%

2122
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
but

2123
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
a probability.

2124
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
For example,

2125
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
50% is 0,

2126
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
50% is 1,

2127
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
etc.

2128
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It is a spectrum.

2129
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It is not

2130
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
limited to

2131
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
0 and 1.

2132
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
It can store information

2133
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
in various proportions.

2134
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
There are more ways

2135
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
to store information.

2136
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
When you ask

2137
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
what 0 and 1 are,

2138
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
it does not have

2139
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
a direct correspondence.

2140
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It is difficult to explain directly.

2141
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Simply put,

2142
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I did not say

2143
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
that qubits can be used

2144
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
to store information.

2145
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
For example,

2146
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
half-quantum vortex

2147
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
can be used

2148
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
as a qubit.

2149
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
There are many qubits.

2150
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
All of them

2151
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
can have

2152
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
high degeneracy

2153
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
in such a state.

2154
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Many configurations

2155
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
have the same energy.

2156
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
When you do

2157
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
some braiding

2158
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
to exchange

2159
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
their positions,

2160
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
etc.,

2161
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
you can jump

2162
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
from one degenerate state

2163
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
to another degenerate state.

2164
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
This is a

2165
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
kind of operation.

2166
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Hilbert states

2167
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
can store

2168
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
information

2169
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
corresponding to

2170
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
only 0 and 1.

2171
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It is not easy

2172
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
to explain in detail.

2173
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
If you have

2174
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
any questions,

2175
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
we can

2176
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
discuss offline later.

2177
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
The reason why

2178
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I say it is

2179
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
immune to localized noise

2180
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
is that

2181
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
the qubits are

2182
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
composed of

2183
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
a pair of half-quantum vortex

2184
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and a pair of

2185
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
degenerate states.

2186
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
They are entangled,

2187
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
but they can be

2188
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
in two different places.

2189
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
When you jump from

2190
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
one degenerate state

2191
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
to another,

2192
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
you can only

2193
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
jump from

2194
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
one degenerate state

2195
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
to another

2196
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
by braiding.

2197
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Other operations

2198
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
are not sensitive to noise.

2199
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
That's why I say

2200
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
it is immune to localized noise.

2201
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Unless you have

2202
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
a special noise

2203
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
that can

2204
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
braid two different qubits.

2205
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
If you can

2206
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
find a noise

2207
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
that can do this,

2208
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
it can't be immune

2209
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
to localized noise.

2210
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I hope I can

2211
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
answer your question.

2212
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Okay.

2213
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The last two questions

2214
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
are from the same person.

2215
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Hello,

2216
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'm Zhang Zhiyuan.

2217
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I'm currently studying at Tsinghua University.

2218
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I'd like to ask

2219
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
if Marijuana

2220
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Zero Mode

2221
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
is stable

2222
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
or

2223
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
will it decay

2224
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
after some time?

2225
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Also,

2226
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
do you always

2227
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
use the first law

2228
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
or do you use

2229
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
different methods

2230
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
to study the theory of

2231
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
denatured states?

2232
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
That's a good question.

2233
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
The first question is

2234
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
that it is an eigenstate.

2235
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
It is a Hamiltonian

2236
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
eigenstate,

2237
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
so it is a stable state.

2238
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Theoretically,

2239
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
it shouldn't decay

2240
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Another question is

2241
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
that I don't use the first law.

2242
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I have a lot of

2243
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
collaborators who use the first law.

2244
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
What I do is

2245
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
from

2246
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
mean field theory

2247
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
to

2248
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
mean field theory,

2249
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
renormalization group,

2250
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
diagrammatic calculation,

2251
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
and

2252
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
we also use

2253
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
k-theory

2254
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
to deduce the

2255
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
unchangeable number,

2256
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
topological invariant,

2257
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
and then work with

2258
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
collaborators using the first law

2259
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
to calculate

2260
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
the number

2261
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
deduced

2262
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
from the

2263
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
material library.

2264
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
OK.

2265
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That's all for

2266
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
the first part of the

2267
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Q&A.

2268
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Please turn on

2269
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
the microphone

2270
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
to thank

2271
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Professor Xu.

2272
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Thank you.

2273
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Let me

2274
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
turn off

2275
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
the recording first.

2276
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
OK.
