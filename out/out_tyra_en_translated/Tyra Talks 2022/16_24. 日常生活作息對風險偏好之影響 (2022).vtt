00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello everyone, welcome to Taira Talk.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Taira is a friendly environment for young Taiwanese researchers,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
and we hold Taira Talk every weekend throughout the year.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
The format and content of this speech are very free and diverse,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
and academic researchers can come here to share their achievements

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
based on their own qualifications, practice online lectures,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
or get to know future potential researchers.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Please join the audience on the right.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Today's speaker is Yan Zhiyun.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
She is currently a PhD student at Paul Glincher University of New York,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Professor of Neuroscience and Economics.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Her main research focus is on collecting long-term data

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
from mobile apps to explore the relationship between

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
individual daily activities and their risks and time preferences.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Today's speech is a part of the data sharing.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
The results of today's sharing have already been reviewed in the first round,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
and are currently being reviewed,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
so she welcomes any suggestions and ideas.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
If there are any questions during the speech,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
she can interrupt, right?

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Yes, you can interrupt or ask questions if you don't understand.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Yan Zhiyun, I'll leave the next part to you.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Let me share the screen.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Okay, good.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Do you understand?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I don't know why I suddenly have echo.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Do you still have it now?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
No, I don't think so.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
The topic of my speech today is

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
First of all, thank you everyone for coming to this event.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
The topic of my speech today is

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
what my PhD thesis is doing.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
We all know that risk and uncertainty

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
are closely related to many of our choices in our lives.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
For example, whether to get vaccinated.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
In Taiwan, we don't think it's risky to get vaccinated.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
But in the US,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
many people don't want to get vaccinated because they think it's dangerous.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Or in another domain,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
for example, do you want to invest in virtual currency?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
These decisions are actually risk and uncertainty.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So a person's preference for taking risks

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
So a person's preference for taking risks

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
actually greatly affects whether he is willing to make these decisions.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
So when we researchers study,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
we put this concept

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
a person's individual willingness

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
to make this kind of risky choice

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
called risk preference or risk additivity.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
a person's individual willingness to make this kind of risky choice

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
called risk preference or risk additivity.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Whether it's economics or psychology,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
we usually think of risk preference

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
as a more stable psychological trait.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
as a more stable psychological trait.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
There will be differences between individuals.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
But more and more research shows that

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
our risk preferences are actually between individuals.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
There will be systematic changes.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
There will be systematic changes.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
It's very dynamic.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So we want to know

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
what kind of factors will cause

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
whether it's between individuals or within individuals

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
So in the past,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
our gender is a factor.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Our gender is a factor.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
In the past,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
women are usually more at risk

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
in terms of financial risk.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Women are usually more at risk in terms of financial risk.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Or older people are more at risk

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
in terms of financial risk.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Research also shows that

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
if you have a good cognitive ability,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
you are more willing to take some risks.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
you are more willing to take some risks.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Your mental well-being is also a very important factor.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
If you are a person with anxiety,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
If you are a person with anxiety,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
you are usually associated with risk avoidance.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
This is a factor that causes differences between individuals.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
There are many factors that cause it.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
For example,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
human or animal research shows

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
that your metabolic state

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
that your metabolic state

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
may affect your risk preference,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
may affect your risk preference,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
but in a relatively short time scale.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
In fact, the good or bad weather

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
may also affect your level of risk acceptance.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
There is a more interesting study

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
that says that if the weather is pretty good today,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
that says that if the weather is pretty good today,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
this is a study done in New York City,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
the probability of buying a lottery ticket is also higher.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
This is an incidental good news.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
This is an incidental good news.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
It's not as if you think the weather is good today,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
so you feel good.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So you are willing to do something

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
that you think will make you feel better about these risks.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So you are willing to do something that you think will make you feel better about these risks.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
For example, buying lottery tickets.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Of course, there are other studies that point out

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
of course, there are other studies that point out

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
that in fact, after the 2008 financial tsunami,

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
people became more risk averse to investment.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
people became more risk averse to investment.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
This is a major life event

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
that affects your level of risk acceptance.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So there are many different factors

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
that affect your level of risk acceptance.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
that affect your level of risk acceptance.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
So we can find that the topic of risk aversion

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So we can find that the topic of risk aversion

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
is actually studied by many people in psychology and economics.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
And it's been studied for decades.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And in all these years of research,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
you find that there are so many different factors

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
that affect the so-called risk aversion.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
that affect the so-called risk aversion.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
It's actually very difficult to know

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
a unified cost-of-risk-preference dynamic.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So what my PhD thesis mainly wants to study

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
is how to put all the factors together

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
is how to put all the factors together

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
So we have two main goals.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
So we have two main goals.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
The first is to establish a data-driven

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
domain general risk preference ontology.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
domain general risk preference ontology.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So this concept is to give a more comprehensive definition

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
of risk attitude or risk preference.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
of risk attitude or risk preference.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
So compared to the past,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
the most recent research is usually a single

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
risk measure or a single survey or a single

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
task developed by economists.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
task developed by economists.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
So in our experiment,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
we not only use a single risk attitude measure,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
we not only use a single risk attitude measure,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
we use a survey and task-based measure.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
we use a survey and task-based measure.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
We also include a lot of different psychological traits,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
We also include a lot of different psychological traits,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
such as your cognitive ability,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
such as your cognitive ability,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
demographic data,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
mental well-being and personality.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
mental well-being and personality.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
We put all these things together

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
We put all these things together

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
and we did a PCA,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and we did a PCA,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
which is the Principle Component Analysis,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
which is the Principle Component Analysis,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
to determine what the covariance is between these

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
to determine what the covariance is between these

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
traits related to risk preference in the past.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
traits related to risk preference in the past.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And then we want to know

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
and these things usually only measured once,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
but we will do a repeated measurement,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
but we will do a repeated measurement,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and we will do a longitudinal experiment.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And we will have a chance to get

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
more static and dynamic risk preference.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
more static and dynamic risk preference.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
When we have the ability to make a more comprehensive

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
definition of risk preference,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
we want to know if the environmental state

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
and the state of life of the victim

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
will affect the change of risk preference.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
will affect the change of risk preference.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
will affect the change of risk preference.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
So, in the end,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
we hope to establish

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
whether there are any risk preferences

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
in his life.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
and whether there's a significant correlation

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
with the risk preferences we measured.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
with the risk preferences we measured.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
with the risk preferences we measured.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
with the risk preferences we measured.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
These are the two things I'd like to do.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
These are the two things I'd like to do.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Next, I will introduce how we do this experiment.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Overall, we collected a lot of different

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
So, we have a total of 14 self-report surveys

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
and two main economic choice tasks.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
and two main economic choice tasks.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
We measured demographic characteristics,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
cognitive ability, mental health, and personality.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
cognitive ability, mental health, and personality.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
These are all factors that have been proven by past experiments.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
We put them all together and measured them.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
We conducted eight weeks of tests.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
These surveyors did a total of 93 instruments.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
These surveyors did a total of 93 instruments.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
In these eight weeks, they did experiments every day.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
In these eight weeks, they did experiments every day.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Each instrument has a specific deployment schedule.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Each instrument has a specific deployment schedule.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Some are done once every two weeks.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Some are done once every two weeks.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
The different colors on the top are the surveys

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
The different colors on the top are the surveys

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
that have been measured many times.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
For example, we measured your anxiety,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
For example, we measured your anxiety,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
and your personal health questions.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
and your personal health questions.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
This is related to depression.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
This is related to depression.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
intertemporal task

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
risk and ambiguity task

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I will talk more about these tasks.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I will also talk about the activity tracker.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
We do a one-time schedule.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
We do a one-time schedule.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
We do it every day for eight weeks.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
We do it every day for eight weeks.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
We try to make them do it every day for less than three minutes.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
We divide the longer schedule into several days.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
We divide the longer schedule into several days.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
They only do it once,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
but some of them will be divided into smaller documents.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
but some of them will be divided into smaller documents.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
This is the demographic.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
This is the demographic.

is when you have two choices

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000

or the $15 prize.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Intertemporal test

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
is when you have two choices

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
to win the $5 prize

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
or the $15 prize.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Intertemporal test

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
is when you have two choices

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
to win the $5 prize

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
or the $15 prize.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
We also use these parameters

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
to feed the risk-choice models

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
to our data.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
We also use these parameters

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
to feed the risk-choice models

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
to our data.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
We use these parameters

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
to create our model

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
to create our model

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
We use these parameters

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
to create our model

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
We use these parameters

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
to create our model

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
to create our model

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
This allows us to know

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
what the parameterb

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
or what the parameter's expectation is

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
You can think of these alpha parameters

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
as based on the alpha parameters

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
in EXPECT UDILY model

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Since we have such a model

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
we fit it into a single logistic function

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
with maximum likelyness

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
The gamma parameters are used to measure

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
the choice of noise in the task

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
So we include these parameters

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
in the variables I just mentioned

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
alpha, m, and gamma parameters

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
So this is what we have

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Let me talk about it a little bit

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
There are also these model fitting parts

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
Let's talk about our test subjects

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
We have a total of 123 test subjects

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
They are found in the CrackList

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
and in NYU's Psychology Research Participant System

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But most of them are from CrackList

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
So most of them are not students

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Out of the 123 test subjects

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
there are a lot of people who have completed the whole experiment

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
This is a two-month experiment

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
but there are still a lot of people who have completed it

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
So we have a pretty high compliance rate

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and there are 115 subjects who have completed all the experiments

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
We exclude some subjects

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
because from their choice

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
we know that they don't seem to be doing the experiment seriously

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Or they did some very irrational behavior in our task

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
This is also one of the criteria for excluding test subjects

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
In the end, we include a total of 96 test subjects

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
in our final analysis

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
So next I'm going to introduce

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
the result of our PCA

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
The result of this PCA

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
is that we used the four principal components

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
to represent all of our data

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
The four components in the front

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
contain a total of 46% of all variances

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Let's talk about the risk-choice ratio

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
In fact, we are repeatedly measuring

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
So we have a lot of risk-choice ratios

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
So before we created this PCA

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
we used the mean value to represent

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
the tasks that have been measured many times

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Then it is represented by their average value

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
So in this table

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
I have colored it

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
The loading in this PCA is greater than 0.2

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
So it means that in this principal component

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
these variables are more important

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
We can find that

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
mainly in the first principal component

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
It mainly contains these tables

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
related to mood and mental wellness

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
and impulsivity

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
which is the UPPS document

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
and intolerance of uncertainty

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
In fact, the intolerance of uncertainty

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
is measured by the psychiatrists' table

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
to measure the degree of uncertainty

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
of a person

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
They often use this table

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
to relate to anxiety and depression

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
So we can find that

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
the table designed by the psychiatrists

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
is more related to the anxiety

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and depression

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
The table designed by the psychiatrists

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
is more related to the anxiety

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
and depression

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
We can find that

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
the table designed by people in different fields

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
is more related to the anxiety and depression

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
We can find that

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
The second principle component

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
is the tasks designed by economists

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
is the tasks designed by economists

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
It mainly contains

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
the variables in the second principle component

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
It mainly contains the variables in the second principle component

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
We can find that

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
in this survey

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
we can find that

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
there are common variables in the second principle component

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
we can find that

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
there are common variables in the second principle component

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
We can talk about it

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
In fact, there is a big debate in the research of risk bias

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Is it a survey

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
or a game designed by economists

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
The measured risk bias is your real risk bias

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
A part of the research is actually discussing

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
which measurement is more reliable

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
which measurement is more reliable

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
which measurement is more general

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
to measure the so-called risk performance

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
There is a debate

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
However, we found that the survey and the task

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
However, we found that the survey and the task

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
are highly related

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
It is worth noting that

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
the task is related to financial risk

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
the task is related to financial risk

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Indeed, in the task, they are asking about money

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
The other related is the risk to health

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
The other related is the risk to health

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
and the risk to safety

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Recreation is less related

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Recreation is the relation of others

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Recreation is the relation of others

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
It is not so closely related

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
The third and fourth are the remaining variants

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
The third and fourth are the remaining variants

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
The third is the ver Komponent

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
The fourth is the current variance

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
This mainly inhaled all the change related to the task

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

27:09.000 --> 27:18.000
This mainly in the third Principal Komponent

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
This principle Komponent is used as a single vector

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
This principle Komponent is used as a single vector

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
to build dynamic risk preference ontology.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
How do we move from dynamic risk preference ontology to dynamic?

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
The way is

27:49.000 --> 27:56.000
These models are model-free variables and model-based variables.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
These variables have a relatively large loading in PCA3.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
So we use these loading.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I just said that when we create this PCA,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
we actually use the mean value.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
So what we're going to do is

28:20.000 --> 28:29.000
we're going to take the different 8-week data

28:29.000 --> 28:41.000
and represent the different 8-week risk additive-related variables.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
We do metric multiplication.

28:46.000 --> 28:55.000
Let each indicator have a different risk additive score every week.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
After the multiplication, each indicator will have 8.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
We have a total of 96 indicators.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
So there are 96 indicators and 8 data points for each indicator.

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
So it will become a matrix of 8 times 96.

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
Then we get the weekly risk component score.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
One thing to remember is that

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
a relatively low risk component score indicates a higher risk tolerance.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
A relatively low risk score means that you are more willing to take risks.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
This is actually just the relationship of positive and negative numbers in math.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
So you just need to remember this kind of relationship.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
What we're going to do is,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
like I just said, how do we put our goal 1 and goal 2 together?

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
We want to see how the risk component score of these 8 data points

30:02.000 --> 30:17.000
is related to the different 8-week sleeping time duration and working time duration.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
So we want to know, for example,

30:20.000 --> 30:30.000
whether the total length of sleep at T-1 will affect the current T-1 risk component score.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
At the same time, we also want to know,

30:33.000 --> 30:42.000
for example, the relationship between the previous week's risk component score and this week's risk component score.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.000
So we did a regression based on this relationship.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
So if we write this regression out, it's a bit like this.

30:56.000 --> 31:04.000
You can think of this P3 as the risk component score for this week.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
What we want to know is,

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
how much of the previous week's sleep time duration can predict the risk component score for this week.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
We also added this variable,

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
which is the risk component score for the previous week,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
to control the autocorrelation.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
Then we added the dummy variables for each victim.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Then we also asked,

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
after completing this regression,

31:38.000 --> 31:46.000
how much of the residual can be explained by the previous two weeks' sleep time and the previous two weeks' risk component score.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Then we also added the variable for the sleep time,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
to control the autocorrelation.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
We also added the variable for the work time,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
which is the risk component score for the previous two weeks,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
to control the autocorrelation.

32:05.000 --> 32:12.000
So we did a total of different regressions.

32:12.000 --> 32:28.000
Finally, this graph shows the beta value coefficient for this activity.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
This is the level of sleep.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
At each time point, t-1, t-2, t-3, and t-4,

32:36.000 --> 32:50.000
we found that sleeping at t-1 significantly predicts the risk.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
So this is the only significant result we found.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
These two graphs show the risk of the previous week,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
and whether it has a significant impact on the risk of the next week.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
We found that it does.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
We also found that the predict power of other activities

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
We also found that the predict power of other activities

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
did not significantly affect the risk of the next week.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
So this is the result we found.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
To conclude,

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
the domain-general-risk-attitude ontology can be used

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
to capture the relationships between your daily life

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
and the dynamic of psychological properties.

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
The sleep time can predict risk-evaluation changes.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
The conclusion from the results is,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
if you had more sleep the previous week,

33:55.000 --> 34:05.000
you will be more willing to take risks the next week.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
So, this conclusion can tell us that

34:12.000 --> 34:21.000
a simple physiological thing can affect our risk-preferred changes.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
So, this is the conclusion we have so far.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
We have also found that

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
your sleep level can also significantly affect

34:34.000 --> 34:45.000
the negative mood of the next week.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
So, if you had more sleep the previous week,

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
you will be more willing to take risks the next week.

34:53.000 --> 35:01.000
So, the sleep time can predict a lot of things.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
So, this is what we have found so far.

35:08.000 --> 35:16.000
So, this is the end of my presentation.

35:16.000 --> 35:25.000
Thank you for listening to my presentation.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
Thank you, Ziyun, for your wonderful presentation.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Thank you.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Can I ask a question first?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Sure, go ahead.

35:40.000 --> 35:47.000
So, I want to ask,

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
why is it that the more sleep you have, the more risk-tolerant you become?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
What I want to ask is,

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
is risk-tolerance related to self-control?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Does it need self-control or not?

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
For example, the less sleep a person has,

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
the less self-control they have.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
I don't know if this is correct.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
If it's correct, then it's still incorrect.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
If it's correct, then...

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Sorry, I'm just...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Please continue.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
No, I mean...

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
It sounds like the less self-control you have, the more...

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
You can't take risks.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
You want to take more risks.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Yeah, because...

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
I think it's related.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, I've seen that too.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It's because of the lack of self-control,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
so they take risks.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
That's right.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
For example, drinking too much or something like that.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
I want to know more about this.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
I think it's mainly because...

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
First of all, we have measured the so-called self-control trait.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
We found that the trait has nothing to do with our risk attitude.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
That's the first thing.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I think this relationship...

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
The relationship we're trying to explain is...

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
It's because you might...

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Actually, I think the logic can be explained on both sides.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
If we're talking about the logic of this story,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
it's because you slept better last week,

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
so you might be in a better mood this week.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
When you're in a better mood,

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
you might have a higher expectation for something risky.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You might be more optimistic.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So you might want to say,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
I'm more willing to take this risk.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That's true.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
You just said that...

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I've seen this study too.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
If a teenager doesn't sleep well,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
if he's sleep-deprived,

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
he might not be able to calculate some of his behaviors.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
You can't do an effective calculation.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
He might not be able to do it.

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
He might do something risky.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
I've seen the direction of the study.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
So when I came to this conclusion,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I was actually thinking about how to explain it.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
The explanation we wrote in the paper

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
is probably to explain it in this way.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
The so-called repeated major risk

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
is actually more like financial risk.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Strictly speaking,

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
it's either no or zero.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
It's in a positive domain.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
It's not in the negative risk domain.

39:05.000 --> 39:10.000
So the teenager's risk is more likely to be lost.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
But our risk is more like the risk in the gain domain.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
So there might be such a difference.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
So, for example,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the research here can't infer that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the more you sleep,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
the more you want to go to the casino.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
I think maybe...

39:36.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm just curious.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
If you put it that way,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't think there's a way.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
I think you put it very well.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
We're not particularly...

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
If you sleep well,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
if you face some risky things,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
you might be more serious about it.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You're more serious about evaluating

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
or calculating what the risk is.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Because some things are actually...

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Of course, after the assessment,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
you're willing to take the risk.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
That risk may be...

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Before you have the assessment,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
you don't have the information,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
you don't have the concept.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Because after you sleep well,

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
you're more mentally prepared to do this.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
You need more calculative resources.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Some calculations.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So if you put it that way,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
you might be facing some

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
risky choices that might benefit you.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Then you'll have a better chance to do it.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Even if it's taking risks,

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
but it's actually a good decision for you.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I think there are actually a lot of

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
different scenarios.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It feels like you see this result,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
and then you have to come up with a story to explain it.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So actually,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
it seems like you have to see different results.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
It's also quite possible to use...

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
There may be a lot of contradict results.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's true that it happens a lot.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I think this result is quite interesting.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
I can understand what you mean.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Because I've seen a lot of papers.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
They put the risk...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Like you said, it's a lost domain.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
They see risk as a negative thing.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
But you're using tolerance here.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
So you can understand that

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
a person would be more willing to

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
take the risk reasonably.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
About those tasks that require risk but are beneficial.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
In terms of the nature of our task,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
you're actually willing to take the risk.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The expectation is actually higher.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Because if we calculate it,

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
you always take a safe risk.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Because you get 5 dollars.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
But if you calculate the risk-free choice,

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
our design is higher than 5 dollars.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Do you have any other questions?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
If you have any questions, you can ask them directly.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
I have two questions I want to ask.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
I think your design is really...

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
You put a lot of factors into it.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
It's quite rigorous.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I have two questions I want to ask.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
The first one is...

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
Because the age range of your audience is quite large.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
From 18 to 67 years old.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
I imagine that at different ages,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
their life activities would be quite different.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
For example, some people have retired.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Some people are working.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Some people are young and still in school.

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
Is there a difference in age or gender?

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The second question is...

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
When I was collecting the demographic,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I was quite curious about

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
whether it was related to social status.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
I feel that social status also affects

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
the degree of risk you can take.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Especially in the financial sector.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Do you think there is a difference in life activities at different ages?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I haven't analyzed this yet.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
But I think there should be.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
But if you just look at the age and gender variables,

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
and compare it with the risk-taking behavior,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
we can see that people who are older

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
are less likely to take risks.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
But we don't see a significant difference in gender.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
We did ask more questions about social status.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
We asked about their academic background.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
We also asked about their financial status.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
We asked a lot of other questions.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
The variables I mentioned are not what we asked.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We have more questions to ask.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
But I don't have time to analyze other information.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
So I haven't taken a closer look.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
But we did ask a lot of questions.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
We also asked about their drinking habits.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
We asked about their smoking habits.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
We still have a lot of questions.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
But we haven't taken a closer look.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Anyone else has a question?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
If you have a question, please ask.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Hello.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Can you show us what the app looks like?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Oh, sure.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I'd like to take a look.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I'll stop sharing my screen

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
and show you the screenshot.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Okay?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Sorry.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I remember I don't have it in my IRV.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Okay.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
This is what our app looks like.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
It's like a map.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Can you see it?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
This number means how many tasks you have to do.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
The user can click on it.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
After clicking on it,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
like what I mentioned in the report,

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
the rich tasks or surveys.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
If you don't complete a task,

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
you can get this gem.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You can buy this gem

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
to decorate your avatar.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
This is the avatar.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
This is one of the ways to design your avatar.

46:24.000 --> 46:31.000
It's like completing a journey every week.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
After you complete it,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
you can open this gem.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
But this gem doesn't mean anything.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
We'll actually give them money.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Every time you complete a journey,

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
the map behind it will be different.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
On the left,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
because it hasn't completed these tasks,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
the map behind it hasn't been opened yet.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
This one is already done,

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
so the map behind it will come out.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
It has different styles.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
I think the interface design is quite beautiful.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
I can share the company of this app to you.

47:11.000 --> 47:24.000
We use this design app to do experiments.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
So it's mainly this data cube app

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
to do our experiments.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
This is what I just said.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
You can design your own style.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
You can make the user more engaged.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
But the most engaged way is to give them money.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
We give them weekly payment for the user fee.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
We'll also give them extra bonuses for the tasks we do.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
So it's meaningful for them to make those choices.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It's not like they're done and that's it.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
We really give them a corresponding reward

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
based on their choices.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
So that's about it.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
If no one has any questions,

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
I can ask one more question.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
I'm sorry.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
I don't think this is a question.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
I don't know if you've read

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
the Noise book published by Daniel Kahneman last year.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
I just read it.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I've heard of it, but I haven't read it.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
I strongly recommend it.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
I think this research sounds like

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
a term invented by him called Occasion Noise.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The difference in decision-making between people

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
depends on mood and physiological feedback.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
He mentioned something called

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Stable Pattern Noise.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
He said that this is the biggest difference

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
in group decision-making.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
But there are very few documents being reviewed now.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
I just saw that you did age and gender.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
You said there's a difference.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I'm curious.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
When you were reviewing these documents,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
how did you feel?

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
Why do you think

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
this demographic

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
is difficult to review

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
or study?

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
That's about it.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I think the difficulty lies in

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
the fact that this topic

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
has a long history.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So there are a lot of documents.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
And the most difficult thing

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
is what I just said.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
How do you define the so-called risk preference?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Risk preference is a very difficult thing.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
It's a very abstract construct.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
It's not like other things.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
I don't know.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
But I have to say

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
how do you say

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
this person's risk preference?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It's really hard to measure

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
with a single quantitative table.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So if you use different quantitative tables

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
to measure,

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
you might get different results.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Because what you might ask

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
is different from what other people ask.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And the so-called risk

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
has a lot of different domains.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
There are a lot of different areas of risk.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I might be a person

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
who is very willing to

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
ride the cloud car.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
But I'm actually very afraid of socializing.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
For example, I may not dare

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
to publish a different opinion

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
in a company.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
These two are actually risks.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
But in fact, their areas

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
are very unrelated.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
So I think

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
this is the most difficult part.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's really hard to have

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
a unified risk preference definition.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
In addition to what I just said,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
in fact, this topic

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
has been studied

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
by economists, psychologists,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and psychologists.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
People from different fields

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
have different research methods.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
The thinking of different research methods

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
is very different.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Because this is a very cross-field

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
and very important research topic.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
But everyone's research method is different.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
And the face of concern is also different.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
So it becomes that there are

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
documents everywhere.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
There are a lot of documents.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It's just that it's really difficult

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
to have a single conclusion.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And there are a lot of...

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
For example, gender.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
There are a lot of different conclusions

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
just about gender.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Even if there is

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
that kind of meta-analysis,

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
you will find that

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
there are actually a lot of

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
different conclusions.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So I think this is

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
a very difficult place.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I'm sorry.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
I just...

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
In that book, it says

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
that there are very few documents.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
But you just said

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
that there are a lot of documents,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
but the conclusions are different.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Yes.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
What do you mean by

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
very few documents?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Can you say that again?

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Do you mean gender and age?

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Gender and age are your research.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
But Conleman said

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
that it should be considered

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
a difference in domain.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Do you mean different risk domains?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Yes.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I was originally a very risk-taking person.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
I thought you said...

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
But suddenly...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
If I were a judge,

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
I was very sensitive.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Then I suddenly saw this person.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
I thought of my son.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
I was very sensitive.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
He was talking about this.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
OK.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
He said that

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
there is less research in this area.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Yes.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
What do you mean?

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Sorry.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I thought you just said

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
gender or that.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Because I think

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
this is more like

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
the difference in personal experience

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
for your risk preferences.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Personal experience,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
or the so-called...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
We actually want to find

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
environmental factors

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
to see if these environmental factors

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
affect you.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
But in fact,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
I think it's hard to study.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Because it's hard to measure.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
It's hard to ask too many

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
personal questions.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
In addition,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
like we used to study,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
there is very little

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
long-term research.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
So without long-term research,

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
it's hard for you

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
to really capture

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
the events

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
that this person will encounter

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
in his life.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Because usually,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
for the example you just mentioned,

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
it's a bit like

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
this event is very...

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
In fact,

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
it's quite unique.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's very special.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
It's like meeting your own child

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
and then being sentenced to death.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
This kind of

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
personal life experience

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
is hard to know.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
In addition,

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
it's hard to ask

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
such a private thing.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
RRB also has to be saved for a long time.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
So I think our researchers

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
try to work towards that direction.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
It's just that

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
you have to do what you said.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
It's really...

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
It's an event

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
for you.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
This kind of

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
risk-benefit difference

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
is really

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
quite difficult to do.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
But gender and age,

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
these two,

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
because it's a more

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
stable factor.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
So many people

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
have done this research.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Got it.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Because it talks about

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
the environment.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
For example,

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
the weather

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
seems to be

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
less than 10%.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
And then

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
the personality

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
seems to be

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
higher.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It's about 20% to 30%.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
So...

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I'm sorry.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
At the moment,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
the related personality

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
has a higher

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
risk-benefit ratio.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Is the current research

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
relatively easier to do?

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
There are quite a few.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
But I think...

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
I think it's mainly

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
like what I just said.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
It depends.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
If you are a psychologist,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
you may not be so interested

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
in the personality.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
So it depends

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
on who is doing the research.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Psychologists

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
may be very interested in this.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
So...

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
There's another thing.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
If you want to know

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
the risk-benefit ratio,

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
you need to know

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
the impact

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
of this risk-benefit ratio

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
on the next action.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
What's the next action?

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Everyone cares about

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
different things.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
So...

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
To answer your question,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
there are a lot of researches

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
on the personality

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and risk-benefit ratio.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
But what's the point

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
of this research?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It depends on

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
what you want to ask.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Okay, thank you.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
So...

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
About the reference documents...

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
I don't think I saw...

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I think you...

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
I think I posted it

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
on my personal website.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Is it not completed yet?

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Because I want to...

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
You mean this research?

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
Yes, the reference documents.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
If you want,

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
I can send it to you.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I've finished

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
a manuscript.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
But...

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
This research

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
is...

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I posted

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Nature Communication.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
After reviewing it,

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
it was rejected.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So I'm reviewing it now.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I hope to post the next one.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
I want to change it.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
I want to share

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
my manuscript

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
in public.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
So I'm still changing it.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So I didn't...

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
At least on our lab website,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I didn't post it.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
But if you want,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I can send it to you.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Okay.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Thank you.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
That's about it.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I can put

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
my email

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
in my chat.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
If you want,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I can send it to you.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I think there was a question

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
in the chat.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
How to raise your hand?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Was the question answered?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I'm sorry.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I didn't notice the message.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Is that person still there?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Found it.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Is there anyone else?

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Okay.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Thank you.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Thank you.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Thank you.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Thank you.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
If no one has a question,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I'll ask the last question.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
No one has a question?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Right.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Like...

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
In experimental economics,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
if you want to control

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
the risk,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
to see the impact of the risk,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
or to control the risk

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
in the lab,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
do you usually use

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
hold and load retax to test it?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
You've seen so many tasks.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Do you think there is

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
a better alternative

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
or suggestion?

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
If it's based on

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
the teacher's idea,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
the task I'm doing now,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
it's relatively simple.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Because it controls one of the options.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Always is the same.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
You just change it.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
But you just said that

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the numbers on both sides will change.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
It makes the task easier.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So...

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Maybe...

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
There won't be problems

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
caused by the task itself.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Because I know some researches

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
say that some tasks

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
are too difficult,

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
so they can't be calculated.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Our...

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Our task

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
is designed differently.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
One option is very simple,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and the other...

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
There's only one variable.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
But...

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I can't say that

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
it's the best option.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
So...

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I think...

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Experimental economists

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
have been developing

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
new experiments.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So...

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
For us,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
we want to simplify

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
the experiment.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Thank you.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Any other questions?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
If not,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
it's time to

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
say goodbye.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Thank you, Ziyun.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Thank you, everyone.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Let's...

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Let's...

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Let's...

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Let's stop here.
