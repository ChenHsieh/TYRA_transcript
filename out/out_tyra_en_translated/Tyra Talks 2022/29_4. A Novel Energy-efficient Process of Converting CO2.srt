00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome everyone to TARA Talk, which will be held on Feb. 19, 2022, which is already Feb. 20 in Taiwan.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today's speaker is Cai Wei, whose theme is Process Optimization and Economic Assessment for Reducing Carbon Emissions by Converting CO2 to Dimethyl Ether with Renewable Hydrogen.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Cai Wei is a Ph.D. student majoring in chemical engineering at NTU. He began his research on carbon dioxide when he was in his junior year of chemical engineering at NTU.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At the time, his main research was on how to capture carbon dioxide from a power plant to gas.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After graduating, he worked in the industry for a few years before joining NTU's Ph.D. program in chemical engineering.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He majored in program system engineering, chemical engineering, program design, and program optimization.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Cai Wei furthered his research at NTU's Ph.D. program.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At NTU, he mainly studied how to convert carbon dioxide into a high-quality chemical product or fuel.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
After graduating from NTU's Ph.D. program, he worked as a chemical engineering design engineer.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He learned the difference between academic papers and practical applications.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He hopes that his research can consider more practical applications.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
His research usually includes the economic assessment of the process and the practical aspects of process control design.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
