00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Terra Talk on November 21, 2020.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We are honored to have Dr. Tsing Ke, who just became Dr. Yin Chao yesterday, to give a speech.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The topic of his speech today is Neutron Irradiation Effect on Tom Stanford Nuclear Fusion Reactor.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If you don't know what ITER is, you can google it.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It is basically the world's largest nuclear fusion experiment or nuclear fusion reactor.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Yin Chao.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Dr. Yin Chao's main field of research is the field he will talk to us about today,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
which is material science, especially nuclear materials, nuclear fusion, tungsten, and neutron irradiation.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In the past, Dr. Yin Chao obtained a master's degree from the Department of Materials at Taipei University of Science and Technology.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
After obtaining a master's degree in the same place, he went to UC Berkeley's Department of Nuclear Engineering and obtained a master's degree.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
After that, he is now at the Belize Nuclear Research Center,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and also obtained a doctor's degree from the Department of Materials at Ruwen University.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Dr. Yin Chao's research focuses on nuclear power plants floating on the ocean,

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and the nuclear fusion reactor material.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Dr. Yin Chao for his speech.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for the introduction.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As I said earlier, my speech will focus on the neutron irradiation effect of nukes.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The nukes will be applied to the nuclear fusion reactor.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me introduce my unit first.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our unit is called SCK-CEN.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
SCK and CEN have the same meaning.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SCK stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center,

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and CEN stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Belize is a bilingual country.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Our unit is located in Mol, which is very close to the Netherlands.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Our unit has three reactors,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
BR1, BR2, and BR3, which are the Belgian reactors 1, 2, and 3.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BR1 is the earliest reactor.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
BR2 is the most recent reactor.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
BR2 is the most recent reactor.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
BR2 was originally designed for material testing.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
some nuclear accidents occurred,

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
like Chernobyl and Fukushima.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Since the nuclear industry has fallen,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
there are not as many experiments to do the material test.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Since the nuclear industry has fallen, there are not as many experiments to do the material test.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Some part of it has been converted into medical isotopes

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and half-body doping.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But they decided to dismantle it due to some problems.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now it is a place to study how to retire the nuclear power plant.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Our company built a Mira.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It is a new reactor,

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
which is controlled by a accelerator.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It is a reactor and accelerator.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you want to know more about our company,

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you can come here.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you want to know more about our company,

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you can come here.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's continue.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
My speech will be divided into five sections.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
First, I will introduce what nuclear fusion is,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
what kind of reactor it is,

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
why we use it,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
what materials I tested,

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
how I tested it,

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and the radiation testing.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Next, I will introduce the development method.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will introduce three methods of development,

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
three methods of improvement,

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to measure radiation.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Next, I will tell you about

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the result before and after radiation.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will tell you about the result before and after radiation.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
First, introduction.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As you know,

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
2 million years ago,

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
humans discovered fire.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The symbol of the discovery of fire

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is that humans began to control chemical energy.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If we did not control chemical energy,

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
there would be no industrial revolution,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and there would be no modern society.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In the middle of the 20th century,

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
another important thing happened.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We discovered nuclear energy,

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and we learned how to use the energy of nuclear fission

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to generate electricity.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We have been using it for more than half a century.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Among them, nuclear fusion is the holy grail of nuclear energy.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If we can control nuclear fusion,

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
we can get relatively clean energy,

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and it is also sustainable.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It can be used for thousands of years.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because the raw materials can be directly planted in the sea,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or mining lithium.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So basically,

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
its fuel is non-negotiable.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In addition,

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
we can even use this energy to expand the universe

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and explore in another galaxy.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because as we know,

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
if you leave the solar system

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
or reach the solar system's borders,

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you cannot use solar energy

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because you are too far from the sun

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
or too far from any core.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So the efficiency of using solar energy is too low.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If you use chemical energy,

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the chemical rocket will not reach that far.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Even if it reaches that far,

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
if you use a fuel cell,

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it will soon run out of fuel.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So the only way is to use nuclear energy.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What is nuclear fusion?

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Nuclear fusion is an example of

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the reaction of copper and iron.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There are two lighter atoms,

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
copper and iron,

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
deuterium and trillium.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They combine to form a heavier atom,

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
helium,

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and release a neutron.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then you can...

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sorry.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can see from the picture on the right

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that the energy released by fusion

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
is much higher than that of fission.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is why we say

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that nuclear fusion is the Holy Grail of nuclear energy.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because the energy obtained

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
from the same amount of fuel

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is about four or five times that of fusion.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Scientists are now studying

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
how to control nuclear fusion.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There are several types of reactors

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that have been proposed.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you want to make a general classification,

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you can classify them into

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
magnetic fields and inertial fields.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The most famous of the magnetic fields

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is the Tokens.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It is also called ITER.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ITER means the way in Latin.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The other one is the Stellarator.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The Stellarator is a centrifuge.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The most famous centrifuge is

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the Winchester 7X in Germany.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The most famous inertial confinement

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is the National Ignition Facility in the United States.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The National Ignition Facility

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
in the United States

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
has a slightly different way

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of generating nuclear fusion.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The way it is confined

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is the same as its name.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It uses a magnetic field

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to confine the electric field.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The electric field is heated to

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
more than 1.5 billion degrees

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to generate nuclear fusion.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The inertial confinement

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
uses a lot of lasers.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It hits the fuel capsule

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to generate high-temperature high-pressure

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and small nuclear explosions.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It is a controllable light explosion.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Among all the reactors

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just mentioned,

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the one that is the closest

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to commercialization

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is Tokamak.

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The most famous one is ITER.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is its diagram.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
As I mentioned,

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
ITER uses magnetic field

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and the fuel is

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
a blade and a wire.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The design of the reactor

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is postmode,

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
which is a kind of

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
pulse-mode reactor.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When the nuclear reaction occurs,

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it releases high-energy neutrons

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and high-temperature electrons

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
along the magnetic field.

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The high-temperature electrons

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
are brought along the magnetic field

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to the diverter,

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
which is the red part.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The diverter receives

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
high neutrons and high-temperature electrons

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and is a pulse-mode reactor.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is a very challenging

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and rigorous challenge.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What is a diverter?

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can see the structure of a diverter.

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The diverter cassette

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
is composed of many plasma-facing units.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can see the plasma-facing units

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
are arranged one by one.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Each unit is composed of

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
several tungsten monoblocks

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and is connected by a tube.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The tube is used to

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
let the coolant flow through.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can see that

208
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
in a steady-state operation,

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
10 MW per m2

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is deposited

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
on the surface of the material.

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can see that

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
the surface temperature

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
rises to 1,200 °C.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The temperature drop

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
is only 8 mm.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is a very serious impact

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
on the material.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In addition,

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
it is a pulse-mode reactor,

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
which produces fatigue.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The temperature is very high.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It is like the temperature

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
produced by friction

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
when a spaceship enters the atmosphere.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is a very extreme condition.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why do we choose to use lead?

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Because lead has the highest concentration

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
in all metals.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In addition, it is basically pure metal

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and has a relatively small

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
concentration after oxidation.

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In addition,

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it is not easy to

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
keep the fuel in it.

236
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
However,

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it is very brittle

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
at low temperature.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It is a bit like ceramic.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Why does this happen?

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
As you may have heard,

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
iron becomes brittle

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
at low temperature.

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It does not become brittle

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
when you hit it.

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is the case

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in BCC,

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
which is also a metal of

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
high temperature.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In addition,

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the temperature may rise to 2,000 degrees

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
when there is a special situation.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In October,

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it is like a solar flare.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It suddenly releases a lot of heat

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and the surface becomes

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
more than 2,000 degrees.

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This will cause the mechanical properties

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
of the material to deteriorate.

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In addition,

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
there will be some

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
transmutation elements

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
due to lead oxidation.

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This is why

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
different materials

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
are developed.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Urethane and

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
high deformation

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
materials

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
have a good feature.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Their DBTT,

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
which I just talked about,

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
will become brittle

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
when it is transformed.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The material that was transformed

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
will become as brittle as ceramic.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The temperature of transformation

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is DBTT.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is called transformation temperature.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In addition,

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
they also propose

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Particle Reinforced Tonsils,

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
which contains some

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
oxidized or oxidized materials

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to stabilize the grain boundary.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The heat stability

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
will be higher.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
DBTT is the same.

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It will contain some

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
fake elements

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to stabilize the boundary.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It can suppress the phenomenon

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
of mechanical growth and tightness.

294
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I have a question.

295
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We also do a lot of

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
neutron scattering experiments.

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We do particle physics,

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
so we care about

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the energy of each neutron

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
more than the total energy

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
multiplied by its flux.

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you care about the energy of neutrons

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
more than the total energy

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
multiplied by its flux?

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We care about both.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I will talk about it later.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What I am talking about now

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is the manufacturing process.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The material is brittle

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
when it is at room temperature.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It is difficult to process.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So we use cross-sectional molding

313
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and spot plasma sintering

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to reduce the number of processing.

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So the final product will be produced.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They propose so many

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
different materials

318
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but they never do the test.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When designing DBTT,

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you need to consider

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the strict conditions

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
for the machine to perform well.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So they need this kind of data.

324
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So my PhD thesis is

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to assess these

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
high-temperature neutron elation effects.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The conditions are

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the highest temperature is 1200°C

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
based on the operation of the ETH diverter.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The ETH diverter's

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
end-of-life

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
which is the highest cumulative mass

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
is less than 1 dPa

334
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
which is displacement per atom.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Displacement per atom

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is a method to calculate

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
how many times the atom is moved.

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The higher the number,

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the higher the displacement per atom.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Hello, can I ask a question?

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes, you can.

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm working in nuclear engineering

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
at Utah University.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So I've touched a lot of these.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So you said the temperature is very high

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and it has displacement per atom.

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But if the temperature is high

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and you heat it up,

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it will return to its original state.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Will it be able to repair itself?

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It will repair itself.

352
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But what I'm trying to say is

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the calculation

354
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
because the displacement per atom

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
is not really displacement per atom.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's interstitial or vacancy.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So the purpose of the cumulative dPa

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
is to calculate the fluence.

359
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Because the neutron source

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and the iron source

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and the electron source

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
all have dPa.

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They all have their own fluence.

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So the purpose of the dPa

365
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is to have a match

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
between the damage and the fluence.

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's just a comparison.

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not that the density of the voice

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
will be that high or that low.

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because at different temperatures,

371
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
like what you said,

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it will have a different effect.

373
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We have a total of 12 materials

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that are being studied.

376
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
One of them is a multi-crystalline material

377
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and the other is a single-crystalline material.

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If the multi-crystalline material

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is divided by the composition of the material,

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
it will be divided into a pure material

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
or a particle-reinforced material

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
or a non-crystalline material.

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
For the pure material,

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
it's either purchased

385
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
or provided by different research units.

386
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So IGP is made in Australia.

387
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
ATW is made in China.

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
IGA is made in Japan.

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Particle-reinforced tungsten

390
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
contains some things like

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
zirconium carbide or titanium carbide

392
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and ethane oxide.

393
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
For the tungsten alloys,

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
as I mentioned earlier,

395
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it contains DOPE and

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
ferric alloy.

397
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
KR is ferric alloy.

398
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you divide it by the composition,

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you can also divide it into three categories.

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There are rolled and forged materials.

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The advanced process is

402
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
spark plasma sintering.

403
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The last one, recrystallized tungsten,

404
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
is a reference group.

405
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's to increase the structure of the fiber

406
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and let us know more about

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the impact of the corrosion.

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If we divide it by the volume,

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
we can divide it into two types.

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The first one is elongated grains.

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You can see that

412
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
only IGP is carrier-like grains

413
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
because it's double forged.

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's broken on both sides.

415
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So it's elongated and

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
looks like fiber.

417
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The other materials are rolled,

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
so it's flat and pancake-like.

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's like a pancake.

420
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The remaining four materials,

421
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
advanced process and recrystallized tungsten,

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
are all equal axis grains.

423
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's not particularly long.

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The four pieces I use are all

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
metatrized samples.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You can see that it's only 12 mm in size.

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's about a dollar in size.

428
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The elongated grains,

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the forged and rolled tungsten,

430
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
are metatrized,

431
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
so their mechanical properties are ideal.

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They have different properties in different directions.

433
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So we took two directions to analyze.

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
How do we define the direction?

435
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's determined by the position

436
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
of the material when it breaks

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If the broken surface is perpendicular

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
to the elongated grain,

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
we say it's an L-sample or LT-sample.

440
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If it's parallel to the elongated grain,

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
we say it's a TL-sample.

442
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There are four tests

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
applied in our experiment.

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The first one is fractured tungsten,

445
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
which has a black line in the middle.

446
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We used EDM to cut it

447
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
in a power-generating way,

448
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and we cut out a small hole.

449
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This small hole can be used

450
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
as a crack,

451
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and it can be used

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
as a crack hole,

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and it can be used

454
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
as a crack hole,

455
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
so we can test

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
the resistance of the crack hole expansion.

457
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
In the end,

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
we cut out the fragment.

459
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Tensile test is the most common

460
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
mechanical property.

461
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The test is mainly for

462
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
measuring the force-force curve,

463
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
compressive strength,

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
elongation strength,

465
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and some elongation properties.

466
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The third one is

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
3-point bending test.

468
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The 3-point bending test

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
mainly tests the bending nature,

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
including bending force and bending hardness.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
In our experiment,

472
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we tested the 3-point bending test.

473
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The last one is

474
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
micro-indentation test.

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
This is a very simple test.

476
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I used an indenter

477
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to press a crack on the surface of the material

478
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to measure its size and hardness.

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If the indent is small,

480
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
the hardness will be high.

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The 3-point bending test

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
is different from the previous ones.

483
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Neutron irradiation is

484
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
done in Fission Reactor 2.

485
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
As we all know,

486
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
fusion and fission are very different

487
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
in the neutron spectrum.

488
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Fission has a very high

489
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
thermoneutron flux.

490
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
In order to make the spectrum

491
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
as close to fusion as possible,

492
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
we need to block

493
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the thermoneutrons.

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We use a steel capsule

495
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
to cover the sample

496
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to block the thermoneutrons.

497
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In addition,

498
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
we put the capsule

499
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in the middle of the fuel channel

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
to reduce the thermoneutrons.

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
In addition,

502
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
we need to perform

503
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
high-temperature experiments.

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The high-temperature experiment

505
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
is because the sample

506
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
will be gamma-heated in the fusion reactor.

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The temperature of the sample

508
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
will be higher

509
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
if we reduce the thermoneutrons

510
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and lower the temperature

511
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
if we increase the thermoneutrons.

512
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We use a spacer pin

513
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to control the distance

514
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
between the sample and the capsule.

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The shorter the distance,

516
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the lower the temperature.

517
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Here are the three tests

518
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
that I developed and improved.

519
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The first one is

520
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
the Fracture Time Detect

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and the Sturman Bending Test.

522
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I combined the two tests

523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
because most of the standard tests

524
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
are aimed at steel.

525
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We all know that

526
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
steel is a high-temperature material.

527
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
However,

528
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
we can't test the material

529
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
directly with the ANC standard.

530
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We can't test the material

531
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
directly with the ANC standard.

532
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
This is an improvement.

533
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You can see that

534
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the Fracture Time Detect

535
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and the Sturman Bending Test

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
increase with the temperature.

537
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
When I combine the two curves,

538
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
you can see that

539
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
they are basically the same.

540
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I can define a DVTT

541
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
when the Fracture Strength

542
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
is equal to 5%,

543
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the Fracture Toughness

544
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
is equal to 5%

545
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and the Fracture Strength

546
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
is equal to 5%.

547
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This can be used

548
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
as a DVTT definition.

549
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
However,

550
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you will find that

551
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the DVTT can't be used

552
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
as a DVTT definition.

553
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We can use the ANC test

554
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
to support or even replace

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
the Fracture Time Detect.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You can see that

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the geometry of the sample

558
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and the test setup are simpler.

559
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It can reduce a lot of costs.

560
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I have a question.

561
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I can understand that

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but do you have a goal?

563
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
For example,

564
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
what kind of spec do you want to achieve?

565
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What do you mean?

566
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
For example,

567
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
what kind of data do you want to improve?

568
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you have a goal

569
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to meet the future needs?

570
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Our goal is

571
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
to reduce the number of tests

572
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and to reduce the number of samples.

573
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
When we do this kind of test,

574
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the space of the reactor is limited.

575
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The number of samples

576
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
is also limited.

577
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Any experiment requires

578
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
high-intensity protection

579
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and a lot of regulations.

580
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
For example,

581
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
a tensile sample

582
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
costs 5,000 euros.

583
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So your focus is on

584
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
developing a way to test.

585
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yes.

586
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What kind of value do you want to test?

587
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The value I want to test

588
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
is the same as the standard.

589
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I can use it to replace the standard.

590
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I see.

591
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So you don't do any value-changing?

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The value-changing part

593
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
is done by other institutes.

594
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I mentioned it just now.

595
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I do the final approval.

596
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It takes a lot of time to do the final approval.

597
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I didn't talk about the time it takes.

598
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
For example,

599
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I have to wait a year

600
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
for the final approval.

601
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
After the final approval,

602
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
you can't do it right away

603
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
because it's too high-intensity.

604
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You have to cool it down

605
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
for half a year or even 10 months.

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't have half the time

607
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I can ask you a question.

608
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Your BR2 Reactor.

609
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I used the Belgian Reactor

610
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
as a benchmark.

611
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Is this called Venus?

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Is BR2 Venus?

613
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Venus.

614
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
They used to build a reactor

615
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
for PWR vessel material testing.

616
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
They modified it.

617
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know if it's called Venus.

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I've never heard of Venus.

619
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Can I ask how much power

620
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
does your reactor have?

621
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
1 MW?

622
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I don't remember.

623
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think it's 50 MW.

624
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I have a suggestion.

625
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You used steel for the capsule, right?

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You want to block the thermoneutron, right?

627
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Thermoneutron interaction

628
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
seems to be better with light material.

629
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If the temperature of the reactor

630
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
is not too high,

631
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
polyethylene seems to be better.

632
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Thermoneutron cross-section

633
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is bigger.

634
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If you use light elements

635
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
to block the thermoneutron,

636
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
will it be easier to produce more thermoneutron?

637
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Because you reduce the number of neutrons.

638
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So you basically use boron.

639
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But boron will affect the reactivity.

640
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes, so it will be more complicated.

641
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They won't let you do that.

642
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Thank you.

643
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So,

644
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
based on the conclusion we just made,

645
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
we can come up with a method

646
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
similar to the ASTM standard

647
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to test the temperature of the steel.

648
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So here,

649
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
we only need one test temperature.

650
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So we only need one temperature

651
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
to do the experiment.

652
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We use the three-point slope

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
to get the slope of the curve.

654
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Then,

655
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
we need to make two assumptions.

656
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
One is 23 MPa square meter,

657
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
which is the DPA we just defined.

658
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The other is Kbase,

659
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
which is the lowest value of the curve.

660
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Why do I use 5 to 10 here?

661
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because 5 to 10 doesn't affect

662
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
the curve during the transition period.

663
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The result is basically the same.

664
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So we can deduce the curve.

665
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So we can deduce the curve.

666
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
This is the deduced curve.

667
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
This is the experiment value.

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You can see that it is quite consistent.

669
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So you can see that IGP,

670
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
its elasticity is better than ATW,

671
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.

672
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.

673
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The second test method we developed

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The second test method we developed

675
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
is the Interrupted Tensile Test.

676
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Generally, the tensile test is to pull it all the way,

677
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
until it breaks.

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
After we get the whole curve,

679
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
we will see the tensile strength.

680
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But we do it differently.

681
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We will see the tensile strength

682
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
when it reaches the tensile strength.

683
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So how do we measure the tensile strength?

684
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
First, we provide a load.

685
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can see the stress goes up.

686
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The load rate is the slope of the stress.

687
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The load rate is the slope of the stress.

688
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,

689
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
we stop the test.

690
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
we stop the test.

691
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We can stop the test

692
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

693
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

694
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
At that point,

695
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
there is no major deformation

696
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

697
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,

698
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
we stop the test

699
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

700
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
At that point,

701
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
there is no major deformation

702
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

703
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
At that point,

704
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
there is no major deformation

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

706
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
At that point,

707
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
we can see that this is a DBT range.

708
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
we can see that this is a DBT range.

709
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The advantage is that we only need one test piece.

710
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The advantage is that we only need one test piece.

711
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This will save us more time.

712
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This will save us more time.

713
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You can see that the HMLR

714
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is higher than the upper yaw strength.

715
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.

716
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.

717
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
This experiment is very suitable for

718
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the materials with the HMLR.

719
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The materials with the HMLR.

720
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You can see that the HMLR

721
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
is a drop in the HMLR point.

722
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

723
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

724
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

725
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You have to be careful to control it,

726
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
because we don't want it to deform,

727
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
so you have to be careful to control the drop point.

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So you have to be careful to control the drop point.

729
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The third,

730
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the last,

731
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
one that I introduced and we developed

732
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
a testing method.

733
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
This test method is very small.

734
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This test method is very small.

735
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
A little test method.

736
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It is an Indian test related to Danjin.

737
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
As we all know,

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Danjin has a mechanical phenomenon.

739
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
In other words, it will have different mechanical reactions

740
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
in different directions.

741
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So when it was doing the Indian test,

742
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
there was a similar phenomenon.

743
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So when I pressed an indent,

744
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I moved it to another place,

745
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
rotated it, and pressed it again.

746
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You will find that the four pictures on the right

747
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
are rotated at 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees respectively.

748
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You will see that their shapes are different.

749
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
When we calculate the hardness,

750
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
the traditional method is called Diagonal.

751
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So it is its diagonal.

752
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Because its shape is different,

753
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
its diagonal is also different.

754
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Then the diagonal is different,

755
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the hardness you deduced is also different.

756
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So there is a fluctuation.

757
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What I use here is the True Project Area.

758
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It will also be different.

759
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The whole black part,

760
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I just use this to calculate.

761
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Then it will also be different.

762
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Why is it different?

763
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Because in Danjin,

764
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
we can use the Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law

765
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
to explain.

766
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law is related to

767
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the relationship between the stretching force

768
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and the cutting force.

769
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It is related to the slip plane of the material.

770
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It is related to the sliding system.

771
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So if the relative angle of your sliding system

772
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
changes,

773
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
your M value will change.

774
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
If your M value changes,

775
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
your cutting force will also change.

776
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So when your material is deforming,

777
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
your dislocation glide

778
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
will also require a different force.

779
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So the deformation of the indent

780
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
you just saw will be different.

781
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So we came up with a small

782
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
suggestion for future experiments.

783
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Because basically,

784
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
there are a lot of people doing low-quantity

785
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
photocopying experiments,

786
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
such as 0.0dPa.

787
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
In this situation,

788
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
the irradiation hardening

789
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
is usually quite low.

790
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If you don't take this into account,

791
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
the anisotropic indentation,

792
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the hardness,

793
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
will cause some of your trends

794
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
to be a little weird,

795
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
to be disordered.

796
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So we came up with this.

797
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Because the indent we used

798
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
as you can see,

799
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
is a Victor hardness indenter.

800
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It has four faces.

801
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So basically,

802
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
the change it produces

803
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
is a cycle of 90 degrees.

804
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So it's a sine function.

805
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So the way we propose is that

806
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
you can do an experiment

807
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
at three different angles.

808
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
This is an indentation experiment.

809
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Then,

810
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
by fitting this sine function,

811
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you get H0.

812
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
This is a very accurate value.

813
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's a more uniform value.

814
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You can use it to compare

815
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the material hardening.

816
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
If you don't know

817
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
your crystallography direction,

818
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
which means you don't know

819
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
where your energy is coming from,

820
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
we suggest you use 8%

821
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to represent your uncertainty.

822
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Because we found that

823
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
no matter how the radiation temperature changes,

824
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
basically,

825
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
the amplitude is about 8%.

826
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Here are the unradiated results.

827
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So this is the general tensile property.

828
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's the tensile property.

829
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
As you can see from the right,

830
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
in the experiment at 400 and 600 degrees,

831
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you can see that

832
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the Zirconium carbide-reinforced tungsten

833
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
has the highest strength,

834
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
which is the brown line.

835
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Before that,

836
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'd like to introduce

837
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
what uniform elongation is,

838
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and what early necking is.

839
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Uniform elongation is

840
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the strength between

841
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
the yield strength and UTS,

842
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
which is the tensile strength

843
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
between the yield strength

844
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and the tensile strength.

845
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This is the uniform elongation.

846
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
If there is no uniform elongation,

847
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
this phenomenon is called early necking.

848
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
At 500 degrees,

849
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
which is 400 degrees,

850
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
you can see that

851
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
basically all materials

852
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
have different levels of uniform elongation,

853
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
except T-orientation,

854
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
which is the material

855
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
in the T-direction,

856
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and L-orientation.

857
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
When you raise the temperature to more than 500 degrees,

858
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
you will find that

859
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
those with mechanical processing,

860
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
such as rolling and forging materials,

861
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
they all become early necking.

862
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Their uniform elongation disappears.

863
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
However,

864
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
those tungsten with advanced processing

865
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
still have the phenomenon

866
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of uniform elongation.

867
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Because of their uniform elongation,

868
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
their work-hardening capacity is better.

869
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Here we also analyze

870
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the relative properties of fracture strength.

871
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You can see that

872
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
IGP,

873
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we use the machine

874
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
of fracture strength

875
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and fracture strength

876
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
to evaluate their fracture resistance,

877
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
which is their toughness.

878
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Basically,

879
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
when you multiply strength and toughness,

880
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
it is energy.

881
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So we can know

882
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
how much energy

883
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
the material needs

884
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
to resist the fracture.

885
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You can see that

886
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
IGP-L needs the highest energy,

887
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
so its fracture resistance is the highest.

888
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
In addition,

889
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
we will find that

890
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
in different directions,

891
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the fracture strength of the same material

892
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
in different directions

893
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
is different.

894
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You can see that

895
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
L's fracture strength

896
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
is higher than T's.

897
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Although their waist strength

898
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and ultimate waist strength

899
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
are basically the same material,

900
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but their fracture strength is much worse.

901
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Why is that?

902
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Here is a possible explanation.

903
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Because their fracture strength is different.

904
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You can see that

905
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the fracture strength of L's sample

906
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
on the right is like this.

907
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So if you crack

908
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and propagate,

909
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
the weakest part of the material

910
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is the fracture strength.

911
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So basically,

912
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
your fractures like to have fracture strength.

913
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
When you expand the fracture strength

914
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
in L's sample,

915
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
it will usually come across

916
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the middle of the fracture strength.

917
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Either it deviates

918
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
or it goes through.

919
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
When it goes through,

920
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
the energy needed

921
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and the force needed

922
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
will be higher.

923
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So why is L's fracture strength

924
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
higher than T's?

925
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
T's fracture strength

926
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
is basically parallel

927
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
to the fracture surface.

928
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So basically,

929
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
it just goes through.

930
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So it's easier to have

931
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
premature fracture.

932
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
On the right,

933
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
you can see that

934
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
the triple junction

935
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
is the junction point

936
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
of the three meridians.

937
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Basically,

938
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
the force will be concentrated here.

939
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You can see that

940
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
L's sample has more force concentration.

941
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
That is to say,

942
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
under the same force,

943
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the force they share

944
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
is smaller.

945
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
This is why

946
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the fracture strength is higher.

947
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
As for T's,

948
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
it has less triple junction.

949
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
This is why

950
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it's easier to have

951
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
premature fracture.

952
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So these two points

953
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
add up to

954
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
T's fracture strength

955
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
which is lower than L's.

956
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Here, we use 3-point contour

957
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
to measure DVTT.

958
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
As I mentioned earlier,

959
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
we can use it

960
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
to replace fracture toughness

961
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to understand DVTT.

962
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
We did a test here.

963
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
We found that

964
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
L's DVTT

965
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
is lower than T's.

966
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That is to say,

967
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
L can deform

968
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
at a lower temperature.

969
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
However,

970
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
T can't.

971
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Let me remind you that

972
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
T and TL

973
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
have the same fracture strength.

974
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
L and LT are the same.

975
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But I use different symbols

976
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
because T is for

977
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
8-centimeter fissure

978
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and TL is for

979
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
3-point contour fissure.

980
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
As you can see,

981
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Advanced Tungsten Grade

982
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
has higher DVTT.

983
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
As for

984
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Heavily Formed Tungsten

985
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and Tungsten Alloy,

986
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Tungsten Alloy

987
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
has lower DVTT

988
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
than 100°C.

989
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Why is this the case?

990
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Why is Advanced Tungsten Grade

991
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
has higher DVTT?

992
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
We found that

993
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
if you have

994
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Raw and Forged Tungsten,

995
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
their

996
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Low Angle Ground Boundary Density

997
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
is higher.

998
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
What is Low Angle Ground Boundary?

999
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Low Angle Ground Boundary is

1000
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the boundary between

1001
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the two

1002
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
less than 15°C.

1003
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The boundary

1004
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
is Low Angle Ground Boundary.

1005
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Low Angle Ground Boundary

1006
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
can have

1007
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
dislocation nuclei

1008
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
on top of it.

1009
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
They can generate

1010
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
a new dislocation source.

1011
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
If you have more

1012
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Low Angle Ground Boundary,

1013
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
you can have more dislocation.

1014
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I just mentioned that

1015
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
you must have dislocation

1016
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
to have Plasticity Formation.

1017
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
That's what I was talking about

1018
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
when I talked about the

1019
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
single-strand boundary.

1020
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The more dislocation you have,

1021
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
the more likely you are to have

1022
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Plasticity Formation at low temperature.

1023
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
That's why

1024
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
these fissures

1025
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
have lower Plasticity Formation.

1026
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We have analyzed

1027
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the difference between

1028
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Fracture Surface and

1029
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Fissure Pattern.

1030
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
On the left,

1031
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
you can see the IGP,

1032
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Commercial Tungsten.

1033
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
This is the tungsten

1034
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
purchased by the company.

1035
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Fracture Pattern

1036
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
is closely related

1037
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
to Fissure Pattern.

1038
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Its denomination is

1039
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
these small cracks.

1040
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
These cracks

1041
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
appear when the temperature is over 400°C.

1042
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Why do these cracks

1043
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
look like this?

1044
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Why do these cracks look like this?

1045
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We can explain it

1046
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
from the perspective of the crystal.

1047
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You can see the L-sample,

1048
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
the sample above.

1049
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You can imagine the crystal

1050
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
protruding from the screen

1051
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
pointing at you.

1052
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
As I mentioned,

1053
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
the Wicked String

1054
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
is the weakest.

1055
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The cracks like to go that way.

1056
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You can see the cracks

1057
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
going along the crystal

1058
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
or crossing.

1059
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The T-Orientation

1060
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
is like this.

1061
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The crystal

1062
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
is arranged one by one

1063
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
on the screen.

1064
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's like when you fold

1065
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
a piece of wood.

1066
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
If you fold it along the fiber,

1067
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
it will look like this.

1068
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
As for the Advanced Tungsten Grade,

1069
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
their crystal is basically

1070
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
in the same axis.

1071
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
The cracks are easily

1072
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
to go along the crystal

1073
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
or cross the crystal.

1074
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
They are extended

1075
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
along the crystal.

1076
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
They are basically

1077
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
many intergranular fractures.

1078
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
There are also partial

1079
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
trans-crystal fractures.

1080
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Trans-crystal fractures are

1081
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
pointed by the green lens

1082
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
which is the

1083
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
trans-crystal fractures.

1084
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The trans-crystal fractures

1085
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
show the grain shape.

1086
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
At higher temperatures,

1087
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
we can only see

1088
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
the fine grain

1089
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
which is called FG.

1090
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
There are also dimples

1091
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
which show the cracks.

1092
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Let's talk about

1093
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Irradiated Results.

1094
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
As I mentioned,

1095
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
we also applied

1096
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
the Inter-Rodent Tensile Type

1097
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
to Irradiated Tungsten.

1098
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We can see the results.

1099
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We have estimated

1100
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
the DVT-T.

1101
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You can see the two materials

1102
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
of DVT-T.

1103
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Recoil-Covered Reinforced Tungsten

1104
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and ATW,

1105
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
which is commercial tungsten.

1106
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Their DVT-Shift

1107
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
is almost the same,

1108
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
which is 200 to 250 degrees.

1109
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Why do we have a range here?

1110
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Although these points

1111
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
have been measured

1112
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
to see if they are irradiated,

1113
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
their large

1114
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
refractive deformation

1115
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
is basically non-existent.

1116
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
They have small refractive deformation,

1117
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
which means that the

1118
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
refractive electric field

1119
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
is directly cut off.

1120
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
As you can see,

1121
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
the transition curve

1122
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
basically has a range.

1123
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Therefore,

1124
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
there is such a phenomenon.

1125
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
When there is a transition range,

1126
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the refractive deformation

1127
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
is relatively small.

1128
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
As you can see,

1129
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the stress increase

1130
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
of the two materials

1131
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
is basically

1132
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
doubled.

1133
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Here,

1134
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I did some tests

1135
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
of Frager-Thomas.

1136
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You can see that

1137
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Frager-Thomas's

1138
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
refractive deformation

1139
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
increases as the

1140
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
refractive field increases.

1141
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Here, I tested

1142
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
the temperature at 600 degrees,

1143
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
so all the points are made at 600 degrees.

1144
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The radiation condition

1145
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
is also at 600 degrees.

1146
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
As you can see,

1147
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
when the

1148
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
DPA of the radiation is getting higher

1149
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
to 0.7,

1150
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
it basically

1151
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
reduces the

1152
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
refractive deformation

1153
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
of the material.

1154
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
In other words,

1155
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it becomes

1156
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
brittle.

1157
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It basically becomes very brittle.

1158
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
In addition,

1159
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
we also found that

1160
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
the

1161
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
tungsten of

1162
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
ATW

1163
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
also increases

1164
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
the refractive deformation

1165
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
as the

1166
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
refractive field

1167
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
increases.

1168
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
This can prove

1169
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
that the

1170
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
refractive field

1171
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
also goes

1172
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
directly

1173
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
through the

1174
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
crystal.

1175
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's not just

1176
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
the crystal.

1177
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
We also did

1178
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
the Transition Curve Estimation.

1179
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I just mentioned that

1180
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
the 23 MPa root meter

1181
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
cannot be used.

1182
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Why?

1183
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Because it cannot be used,

1184
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
we need two

1185
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
experiment temperatures

1186
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
to do the

1187
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Transition Curve Estimation.

1188
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Because we have

1189
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the reference

1190
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Frasier-Thompson test,

1191
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
the non-irradiated

1192
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Frasier-Thompson test

1193
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
uses the Frasier-Thompson test.

1194
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The K-base is 47,

1195
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and the rest is calculation.

1196
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
As I mentioned,

1197
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
the 23 MPa

1198
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
root meter cannot be used,

1199
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
so we redefine the DPET

1200
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
as Tf.

1201
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Tf is the

1202
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
anti-curve point.

1203
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The curve anti-curve point.

1204
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
As you can see,

1205
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
after the radiation,

1206
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
the

1207
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Tf

1208
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
drops to

1209
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
23 MPa.

1210
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Why?

1211
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Because

1212
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
the Tf

1213
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
drops to

1214
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
23 MPa,

1215
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and the DPET

1216
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
goes higher.

1217
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
If I use the anti-curve point

1218
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
as the definition,

1219
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
the IGP

1220
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
grows only 20 degrees.

1221
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
If I use the

1222
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
anti-curve point as the

1223
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
definition,

1224
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
the ATW

1225
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
grows 100 degrees.

1226
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
If I use the anti-curve point

1227
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
as the definition,

1228
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
the ATW

1229
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
grows 200 degrees.

1230
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
The last curve,

1231
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
the green curve,

1232
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
is not a good fit.

1233
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
The K-top

1234
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
is too close

1235
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
to the K-base.

1236
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
The fitting is weird.

1237
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We need

1238
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
a higher temperature

1239
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
for the test,

1240
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
so we can get more

1241
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
experimental points.

1242
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But as we

1243
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
saw,

1244
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
we can say

1245
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the point on the right,

1246
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
the 0.7,

1247
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the DPA

1248
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
is higher than 600 degrees.

1249
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
No,

1250
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.

1251
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
No,

1252
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.

1253
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Here,

1254
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
we use the hardness test

1255
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to evaluate the

1256
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
irradiation harmony,

1257
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
which is the hardness

1258
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
after corrosion.

1259
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
As you can see,

1260
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
the highest change

1261
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
in most materials

1262
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
is in

1263
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
irradiation harmony

1264
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
at 1000 degrees.

1265
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
At higher temperature,

1266
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
as we mentioned,

1267
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
there will be annealing.

1268
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Many DPETTs are annealed,

1269
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
so the temperature drops.

1270
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But it's still high,

1271
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
as you can see,

1272
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
it's similar to 600 degrees.

1273
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
We haven't done

1274
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
the TEM yet,

1275
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but we are doing it.

1276
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We need to prepare the TEM

1277
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and use GLOBAL,

1278
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
so we need to do it directly.

1279
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Many materials

1280
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
have high irradiation harmony,

1281
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
so we are still waiting for it to cool down.

1282
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
We haven't done

1283
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
the TEM yet,

1284
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
but according to the document,

1285
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
at higher temperature,

1286
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
the chance of voice

1287
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
will be higher,

1288
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
the voice density

1289
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
will be higher than

1290
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
the dislocation density.

1291
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So,

1292
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
these two parts

1293
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
are composed of voice.

1294
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
At 1200 degrees,

1295
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the voice density will be higher.

1296
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
In addition,

1297
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
the current theory

1298
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
states that

1299
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
the higher the range,

1300
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
the more

1301
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
irradiation-induced defects

1302
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
can be absorbed.

1303
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So, the higher the range,

1304
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
the lower the irradiation harmony.

1305
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
However,

1306
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
IGP is higher than

1307
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
IGA,

1308
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
even though

1309
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
it has a lower

1310
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
voice density.

1311
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Here is

1312
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
a possible explanation.

1313
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
IGA and IGP

1314
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
are pure materials.

1315
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Because

1316
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
of the

1317
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
self-insidious atom,

1318
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
which is a

1319
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
self-insidious atom,

1320
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it will produce

1321
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Frenkel pairs,

1322
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
which is a

1323
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
self-insidious atom

1324
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and a vacuum.

1325
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The self-insidious atom

1326
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
will form an elliptical structure

1327
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
in the BCC,

1328
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
which has a

1329
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
very low

1330
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
dispersion energy.

1331
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Therefore,

1332
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
the self-insidious atom

1333
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
can move

1334
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
in 3D.

1335
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Therefore,

1336
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
the self-insidious atom

1337
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
is more likely to be absorbed by the range

1338
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and leave a lot of vacuum.

1339
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
After that,

1340
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
the voice

1341
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
is higher than

1342
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
the irradiation harmony.

1343
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
That's why IGA

1344
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
has a higher voice density

1345
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
even though

1346
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
it has a higher range.

1347
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
In addition,

1348
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
we also know that

1349
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
hardness and strength

1350
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
are proportional.

1351
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Therefore,

1352
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
we try to

1353
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
evaluate

1354
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
the growth of

1355
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
the curve

1356
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
of the waist strength

1357
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and temperature

1358
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
after irradiation.

1359
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Here,

1360
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
we can see

1361
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
that the brown line

1362
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is the fractional strength.

1363
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
If it intersects

1364
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
with the color line,

1365
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
it is basically

1366
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
the dBTT.

1367
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The dark gray line

1368
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
is the dBTT,

1369
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
which is the position

1370
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
of the rotation temperature.

1371
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
However,

1372
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
all of them are not exposed.

1373
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Only IGP is exposed.

1374
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Therefore, we can suggest

1375
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
that IGA has a better

1376
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
resistance to irradiation damage.

1377
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
However,

1378
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
we can see that

1379
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
the strength

1380
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
is doubled.

1381
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The fractional strength

1382
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
is also doubled.

1383
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The last point is the broken point.

1384
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
The broken point is also

1385
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
doubled.

1386
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
These brown lines

1387
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
should go up.

1388
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Therefore,

1389
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
we can't say

1390
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
where the dBTT is.

1391
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
However,

1392
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
we can only say

1393
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
whether the resistance

1394
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
to irradiation is strong or not.

1395
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
We can only say that IGP

1396
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and Zirconia Carbide Tonsil

1397
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
have a better resistance to irradiation.

1398
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
In addition,

1399
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
all of these hardness tests

1400
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
are done at room temperature.

1401
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Therefore,

1402
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
some things

1403
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
need to be considered

1404
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
before making

1405
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
the final decision.

1406
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Therefore,

1407
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
we still need

1408
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
some high-temperature

1409
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
hardness tests

1410
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
to verify.

1411
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Fortunately,

1412
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
we will soon have

1413
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
a high-temperature

1414
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
hardness test device.

1415
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We will move it

1416
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
to the control area

1417
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
so that we can verify

1418
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
whether the results

1419
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
are correct or not.

1420
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Finally,

1421
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
we can see

1422
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
the single crystal tungsten

1423
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
that we used

1424
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
the unbiased hardness

1425
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
to test.

1426
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
As I mentioned earlier,

1427
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
the hardness fluctuates

1428
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
depending on the rotation angle.

1429
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Therefore,

1430
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
if you don't have H0,

1431
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
you won't be able to figure out

1432
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
the exact temperature.

1433
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If you use H0,

1434
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
you will find that

1435
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
the highest temperature

1436
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
for hardening

1437
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
is 800°C.

1438
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
800°C is

1439
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the highest temperature

1440
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
for tungsten welding.

1441
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
After that,

1442
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
annealing occurs

1443
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and the temperature drops slowly.

1444
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Finally,

1445
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I will summarize

1446
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
the irradiation results.

1447
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You can see that

1448
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the fractional tungsten test

1449
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
and the internal temperature test

1450
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
are used

1451
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
to evaluate the growth rate

1452
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
of dPtT.

1453
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
You can see that

1454
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
the growth rate of IgP

1455
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
is about 0.1 dPa,

1456
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
which is much lower than AtW.

1457
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
AtW will

1458
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
grow to

1459
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
about 300°C

1460
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
at 1 dPa.

1461
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
At 300°C,

1462
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
the cone covering

1463
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
will grow to about 250°C.

1464
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I will also summarize

1465
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
the results

1466
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
after hardening.

1467
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You can see that

1468
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
the results of the tensile test

1469
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
are very similar to

1470
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
the hardness evaluation.

1471
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The curves I mentioned

1472
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
can be used as a reference.

1473
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
They are basically the same

1474
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
as the tensile test.

1475
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
In addition,

1476
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
AtW and IgP

1477
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
have similar density.

1478
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You can also see

1479
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
that their hardness

1480
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
is similar.

1481
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The theory

1482
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
may be correct.

1483
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
In addition,

1484
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
we can also see

1485
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
the hardness

1486
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
of the materials

1487
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
at different temperatures.

1488
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You can see that

1489
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
most materials

1490
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
decrease at 1200°C,

1491
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
except

1492
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
titanium carbide reinforced tungsten.

1493
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This is a very special phenomenon.

1494
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We need to

1495
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
use TEM to study further.

1496
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Because

1497
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
there is no annealing,

1498
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
the crack does not disappear.

1499
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It does not become larger

1500
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
or self-expand.

1501
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It is a very special phenomenon.

1502
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We need to

1503
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
further

1504
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
analyze it

1505
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
with electromagnetic microscope.

1506
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
In conclusion,

1507
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
this is a very simple

1508
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
take-away note.

1509
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I have developed

1510
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
three different

1511
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
testing methods.

1512
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The first one is

1513
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Miniaturized Sturmanium Test

1514
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
and Fracture Tungsten Test.

1515
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
These tests evaluate

1516
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
the growth rate of

1517
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
DVDT and

1518
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
its curve.

1519
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Interpolated Tensile Test

1520
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
is a test

1521
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
that can measure

1522
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
the strength of

1523
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
different temperatures

1524
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
with a single test.

1525
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The last one is

1526
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Unbiased Hardness Test.

1527
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
With this test,

1528
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
we can get

1529
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
accurate hardness

1530
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and hardness measurement

1531
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
on a single test.

1532
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
In addition,

1533
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
as I mentioned earlier,

1534
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
we use

1535
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
mechanical testing

1536
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and observation of

1537
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
fiber structure.

1538
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
We found that

1539
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
the higher the

1540
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
membrane boundary density,

1541
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
the lower the temperature

1542
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
of the material.

1543
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
In addition,

1544
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
we found that

1545
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
although IGP

1546
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
does not have

1547
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
a high density,

1548
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
its hardness

1549
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
is relatively low.

1550
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Therefore,

1551
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
increasing the density

1552
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
does not necessarily

1553
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
reduce the hardness.

1554
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
This theory may be

1555
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
based on very small

1556
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
nanometers.

1557
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
This theory may be

1558
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
based on very small

1559
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
nanometers.

1560
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
This theory may be

1561
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
based on very small

1562
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
nanometers.

1563
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Thank you.

1564
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Thank you.

1565
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Any questions?

1566
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Any questions?

1567
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Any questions?

1568
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
There is a general question.

1569
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
We all know that

1570
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
material is expensive.

1571
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
How much do you need

1572
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
in Fusion Reactor?

1573
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Will it affect

1574
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Fusion Reactor?

1575
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Basically,

1576
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
if you want to

1577
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
use a magnetic field

1578
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
or a laser,

1579
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
you have to spend a lot of electricity.

1580
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If you want to use wood,

1581
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
what do you think?

1582
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Because I play Fusion Reactor.

1583
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I have always been interested in Fusion Reactor.

1584
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But I don't know much about it.

1585
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Thank you.

1586
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
What about the material?

1587
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
The material is

1588
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
about 900 tons.

1589
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
The material is about 900 tons.

1590
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
900 tons

1591
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
1 kg of material

1592
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
is not that expensive.

1593
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's not that expensive.

1594
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
1 kg of material

1595
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
is less than 100 US dollars.

1596
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So,

1597
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
most of the

1598
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
experience

1599
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
of

1600
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Fusion Reactor

1601
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
is based on

1602
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
the experience of

1603
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Fusion Reactor.

1604
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The cost of materials

1605
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
is usually the lowest.

1606
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Compared to the cost of

1607
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
the operation,

1608
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
the cost of materials is the lowest.

1609
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So,

1610
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
this should not affect

1611
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
the future

1612
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
development of Fusion.

1613
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Another thing I'm interested in

1614
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
is that the material is basically

1615
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
placed at the bottom

1616
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
of Fusion Reactor.

1617
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I want to know

1618
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
the activation rate.

1619
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
After activation,

1620
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
what is the radiation

1621
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
of Fusion Reactor?

1622
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
For example, SIVIR.

1623
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yes, if we use SIVIR.

1624
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
When it first came out,

1625
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
it was more than 50 mSv.

1626
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Its activation rate is not that high.

1627
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Because it only contains

1628
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Rhinium and Osmium.

1629
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Basically,

1630
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
the composition is low,

1631
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
but you can't directly

1632
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
contact it.

1633
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So,

1634
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
it's not as high as

1635
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Fusion Reactor's

1636
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
radiation.

1637
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
So, 50 mSv per hour?

1638
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yes.

1639
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That's pretty high.

1640
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Thank you.

1641
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You're welcome.

1642
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I have a general question.

1643
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Can you talk about

1644
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
the next step of this project?

1645
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I mean the whole plan.

1646
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Which part are you talking about?

1647
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Is it Diverter or the entire

1648
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Ether?

1649
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
What is the next step?

1650
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So,

1651
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Ether hopes that

1652
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
the first Ether

1653
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
will be in 2025.

1654
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
But we estimate that

1655
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
it will be in 2027 due to

1656
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
some administrative issues.

1657
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Some minor issues

1658
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
during installation.

1659
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So, the actual Ether

1660
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
should be in 2027.

1661
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
After Ether,

1662
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
there will be a

1663
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Demonstration Reactor

1664
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
in Europe.

1665
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Demonstration Power Plant.

1666
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It's called DEMO.

1667
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
They want to test

1668
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
some new concepts

1669
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
with Ether.

1670
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Like TDM,

1671
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
or Blanket.

1672
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
The power generation

1673
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
depends on Blanket.

1674
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
80% of the terminal

1675
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
will be generated here.

1676
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
As you can see,

1677
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Helium has only 3.5 MeV,

1678
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
but the terminal has 14 MeV.

1679
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So, the main energy is in the terminal.

1680
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Fusion Reactor

1681
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
harnesses

1682
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
the terminal energy.

1683
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
It relies on

1684
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
the interaction between

1685
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
the terminal and the material

1686
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
to transfer the energy to the material.

1687
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So, Blanket will absorb the energy

1688
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and generate electricity.

1689
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
In addition,

1690
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
in Blanket,

1691
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
you need

1692
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Deuterium and Trillium.

1693
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
The terminal and the terminal

1694
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
do not exist in the natural world.

1695
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So, you need to manufacture them.

1696
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
We have the terminal

1697
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
in the Fusion Reactor,

1698
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and we use it.

1699
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But we can't always

1700
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
use the fusion reactor

1701
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
to generate the terminal.

1702
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So, the concept of Ether

1703
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
is to

1704
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
generate the terminal by itself.

1705
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So, it contains a lot of Li.

1706
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Li generates the terminal

1707
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
with the fusion reactor.

1708
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Then, it uses the cycle

1709
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
to extract the terminal

1710
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
and turn it into

1711
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
the fuel to burn.

1712
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So,

1713
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
this concept

1714
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
will be verified in Ether.

1715
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Some new concepts

1716
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
in Diverter

1717
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
such as Liquid Metal,

1718
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
can be used to

1719
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
generate the terminal.

1720
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
However,

1721
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Liquid Metal

1722
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
does not have this problem.

1723
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So, many new concepts

1724
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
have appeared.

1725
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I hope that

1726
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
it will be applied to DEMO.

1727
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
The goal of DEMO

1728
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
is that the value of Q is greater than 10.

1729
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Q is equal to 10.

1730
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So,

1731
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
the energy generated

1732
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
by the fusion reactor

1733
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
is equal to

1734
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
10 times of the input energy.

1735
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
However,

1736
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
this is a very ambitious goal.

1737
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Because there is no fusion reactor

1738
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that has reached

1739
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
this level.

1740
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Even JET has not reached this level.

1741
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It seems that

1742
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
there is a theoretical value of 1.

1743
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But it has not reached this level.

1744
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So,

1745
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
the goal of DEMO

1746
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
is greater than

1747
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
50.

1748
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The goal is to reach the state

1749
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
where electricity can be generated.

1750
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So,

1751
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
this is a European project.

1752
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
However, there are also projects in other countries.

1753
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Ether is an international project.

1754
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
There are seven countries participating.

1755
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
If the EU is a country,

1756
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
there are

1757
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
EU,

1758
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
China, India,

1759
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Japan,

1760
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
the United States,

1761
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
and South Korea.

1762
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Each country has its own DEMO.

1763
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So, there will be

1764
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
different approaches

1765
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
in the future.

1766
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
However,

1767
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
this is a bit of

1768
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
imagination.

1769
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Although we have many meetings

1770
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
that are already designing DEMO,

1771
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I dare not say that

1772
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Ether has not been built yet.

1773
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Thank you.

1774
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It sounds like the next

1775
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
collider of LHC.

1776
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
LHC can't finish it.

1777
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But they are already discussing

1778
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
how to build the next one.

1779
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I know the timeline.

1780
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Thank you.

1781
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Any other questions?

1782
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I have a question.

1783
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Do you have a contact?

1784
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Or you can email me.

1785
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Yes, I do.

1786
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It depends on you.

1787
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
If our audience

1788
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
are interested in

1789
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
the next project,

1790
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
you can contact

1791
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
our speaker.

1792
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
If you want to

1793
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
review this video,

1794
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
we will upload the recording

1795
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
in a week.

1796
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's all for today.

1797
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Let's give our speaker

1798
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
a round of applause.
