00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello everyone, I'm the host of today's Terra Talk, I'm Hsih-Hui-Ting.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
I'm very happy to be here today to participate in this talk with everyone.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Our speaker today is Yao Naijia.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I personally know Naijia, and I've known her for a long time,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
because Naijia is my college classmate.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Naijia's college, master's, and doctoral degrees are all in the Department of Physiotherapy at NTU.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Naijia was also the secretary-general of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
She has now graduated, and is currently working as the director of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
In today's talk, Naijia will mainly share two parts with us.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
The first part is about her doctoral thesis,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The second part is about medical information design.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The first topic, Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
focuses on early treatment intervention,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
as well as the development of genes related to dopamine in children,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
including cognitive development, action development, and behavioral development,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
as well as the impact of parent-teacher pressure.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
We will also discuss the interaction between genes and the environment.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We look forward to the future long-term development,

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
and we hope to design a more personalized medical plan for these children.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
The second topic is about medical information design.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
After Naijia graduated from her doctoral degree,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
she went to the industry,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
focusing on medical information design and science and technology education.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Through community platforms or activities,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
she will promote medical knowledge to the general public.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
She will also share some of her experience with us.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
In today's talk,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Naijia will share common digital marketing content

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
and discuss more possible developments with our guests.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Naijia will share common digital marketing content

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
and discuss more possible developments with our guests.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Thank you.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Let's give Naijia a round of applause.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Thank you.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Thank you, Naijia.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Let me share my screen.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
You should be able to see it now.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I think that's pretty much it.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
My background is a physics teacher

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
who specializes in children's development.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
in 2016.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
in 2016.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I'd like to share two main points with you.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The first one is

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
about my PhD thesis.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
about my PhD thesis.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
The first one is about my PhD thesis.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
The second one is about medical information design.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I'd like to share my work with you

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
and see how we can share our knowledge

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
and see how we can share our knowledge

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
in the future.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
We are an intellectual industry.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
We are an intellectual industry.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I'd like to make a formal apology.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I'd like to make a formal apology.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
My family is at home.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Please forgive my crying.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I'll start my presentation

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
in the next few minutes.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
We select here oviparous and hormone-related over-time.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
And we focus on early pregnancy.

04:38.000 --> 04:52.000
In the past, differential susceptibility theory tells us that the worse the environment, the worse the performance.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
The better the environment, the better the performance.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
On the contrary, people who don't have this kind of environment may not be affected by the environment.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
Another theory is that there is only a negative environment that makes me perform worse.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
The positive environment is not bad at all.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
Another theory is that there is only a positive environment that makes me perform better.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
The negative environment is not bad at all.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
In this case, we hope to see the advantageous sensitivity.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
This means that the better the environment, the better the performance.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
This structure is divided into several areas.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
First, the environment.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
We want to see if the environment affects the development of children.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Second, the pressure on the parents to have a child.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
This is the part of the day after tomorrow.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
This is the part of the day before tomorrow.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
This is the part of the gene.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
In the past research,

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
we have known that early birth parents will be more stressed.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
In the past, the intervention program also told us that

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
the intervention program can reduce the pressure on the parents.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
However, most of it is focused on the mother,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
and there is less discussion about the father and mother at the same time.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
In this study, we will include the father and mother at the same time,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and it will be a part of the long-term tracking.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
In terms of children, the conclusion of the past study is inconsistent.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Some say that the effect can be delayed to 9 years old or later.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
However, some say that the intervention period is 1 or 2 years old,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
and the effect is almost the same.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
In the future, there will be no effect.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
So our study is also a large-scale study in Taiwan.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
We want to see what effect it will have in the long-term tracking.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Especially in terms of cognition, action, and behavior.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
In terms of genes,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
we chose the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Because the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
has been proven in past studies,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
it may be related to children's development,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
including cognition, ADHD,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
which is related to autism and attention deficit disorder.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
So there are four parts of this study.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
The first is whether our medical intervention

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
has a positive impact on the development of children.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
The second is whether our medical intervention

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
can help parents to reduce their stress.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The third is whether the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
can be related to the development of children.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Finally, it depends on the interaction effect of the gene environment.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
In terms of research,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
we use low-fat premature babies.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
This research is a bit more complicated.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
It will include four studies.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
So if you have any questions about our participants,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
you can discuss with me.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
In terms of procedures,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
we will have a hospitalization period,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
which is when the baby is still in the nursing room.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
We will start to intervene.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
After discharge,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
there will be medical intervention in 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 months.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
As a rule,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
we will use a phone interview to care for the baby.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So this intervention will include,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
including when the baby is in the hospital,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
as we just mentioned,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
there will be some suggestions on feeding,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
massaging,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
and some development stimuli.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
After discharge,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
there will be some transfer to the hospital.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
We will also teach the baby how to adjust the home environment,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
and how to interact with the baby in the future.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
As we know,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
parent-child interaction

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
has a positive impact on the development of children,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
especially children under the age of six.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Because they are basically at home.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Of course, there is also the basic child health check-up.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Basically,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
this is what every child needs to do.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
As for the measurement,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
we use Bayley to measure the development of cognition,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and CBCL to measure the behavior.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
As for the action,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
we use MoveMVC.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Bayley also includes the action part.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
As for parenting stress,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
we use PSI.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Let's talk about our four studies.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
The first part is for the development of children.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Does our medical intervention have a positive impact on the development of children?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
The conclusion is that

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
it is interesting that we use Bayley-2 and Bayley-3.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
These two are because we have been working on the case for a long time.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
We used Bayley-2 when there was no Bayley-3.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
When Bayley-3 was developed,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
we changed it to Bayley-3.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
But what we see in Bayley-2 is

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
that it has a positive impact on the cognitive behavior of children.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
The biggest effect was in Bayley-4.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
However, in Bayley-3,

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
we see a significant difference.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
It also happened in Bayley-4.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
On the left,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
we use a more longitudinal analysis,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
which is also a mixed-event model.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
On the right,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
we combine two RCTs together.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
We use Bayley-2 and Bayley-4 as a forest plot.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
The result tells us that

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
there may be a difference between Bayley-2 and Bayley-4.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It may be a difference in the era.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
Therefore, the normal group has improved.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
In other words, our normal care has improved.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
This difference will gradually disappear.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
On the other hand,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
why do we think that our therapeutic effect

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
seems to be obvious or lasts longer?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It may be that in some past studies,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
their therapeutic process only lasted until the age of three.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
However, our therapeutic effect only lasted until the age of one.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Therefore, it may extend to such a long time.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
For example, at the age of nine or even older,

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
our frequency and length may not be enough.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
On the other hand,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
we may not see any therapeutic effect on behavior.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
It may be because our content

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
is not as close to the part of behavioral modification

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
as some past programs.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The second part is to see

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
whether our medical research has a positive impact on parental pressure.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The result shows two interesting points.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
In the case of mothers,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
the pressure of mothers has always been greater than that of fathers.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
In general,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
the pressure is always greater at any point in time.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
On the other hand,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
our therapeutic effect mainly occurs on fathers,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
but not on mothers.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
This difference can only be seen for a long time.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
That is to say,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
when children reach the age of four,

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
the pressure of their fathers is significantly reduced.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We have also done some research

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
on the relationship between parental pressure and children's behavior.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
In fact, the relationship is quite high.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
That is to say,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
if the behavior of children is worse,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
the pressure of mothers is greater.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
In addition,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
we have also done some research on

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
home activities.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
In our program,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
some activities are done by parents.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Most of the executors are mothers.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
In fact,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
more than 90% of the participants are mothers.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
This result is quite consistent with past research.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
That is to say,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
the pressure of mothers is basically quite high.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
The reason for this possibility is

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
interesting.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
In the previous large-scale research in Taiwan,

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
we also found that

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
most of the main caregivers are mothers.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
This is consistent with our research.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
In addition,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
this past research also mentioned that

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
regardless of whether the mother is a full-time job

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
or a part-time job,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
in fact,

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
most of her household chores

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
are more than that of her father.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
As for the intervention effect,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
we see that

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
the effect of the father's part is effectively reduced.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
It is particularly high in the 48-month period.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It may be because

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
there is a demographic effect

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
that tells us

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
that it is very similar to the rolling snowball effect.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
It may be that

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
this good effect is getting bigger and bigger later.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
So it is particularly obvious in the 48-month period.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Another one is that

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
the reduction of this part

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
is actually related to

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
the better child's action development.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
That is to say,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
the better the child's action development,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
the greater the degree of pressure on the father to reduce.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
As for the mother,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
we did not see any intervention effect.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It may be because

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
our intervention program

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
did not pay much attention

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
to the mother's part.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
But in the past,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
the part that helped the mother

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
may mainly be

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
the part where they have a lot of behavioral adjustments.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It tells us that

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
in the future research,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
we may be able to focus more

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
on the part about mental health.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
This may help more mothers.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Another one is that

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
the father and mother's performance

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
are actually quite different.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
In the past research,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
it also told us that

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
in some problem-solving strategies,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
if the father gets more information

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
in this area,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
it can actually reduce the pressure.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Mothers may need more

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
emotional support.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
The third one is

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
to see if the gene

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
is related to the child's development.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
We chose 15 SNPs.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Among these 15 SNPs,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
there are 8 special connections.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
That is to say,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
there are 8 red boxes on the screen.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Basically,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
it can be used as one of the representations.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Because the results will be about the same.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
What we see is

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
that the MLA gene

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
is related to

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
the preterm child's mental score.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
We also chose

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
an independent copy sample.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It can be used as a verification function.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
The results are exactly the same.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It tells us that

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
the MLA gene is related to

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
the child's cognitive development,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
especially in premature babies.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
The results are the same

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
in the learning sample

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
and the replication sample.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
The results are the same

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
in the past.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
In the past,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
the MLA gene was used

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
in children with

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
attention deficit hyperactivity

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
and autism.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
The MLA gene is used

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
in premature babies.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
The fourth one is

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
to see if the gene is related to

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
the environment.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's a pity that

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
the MLA gene is not related to

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
the environment.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
The MLA gene is used in

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
the SNP sample.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
The MLA gene is used in

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
the VNTR sample.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
The VNTR sample is used

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
to see if the gene is related to

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
the environment.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
For example,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
if the gene is related to

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
the DNA of the parent,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
the MLA gene is used.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
However,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
the MLA gene is not related to

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
the environment.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
The reason is that

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
the MLA gene is not related to

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
the environment.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
The second reason is that

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
we don't use

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
GWAS or NGIS

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
for genetic information.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
The MLA gene is used

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
to miss a lot of

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
genetic information.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The MLA gene is used

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
to miss a lot of

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
genetic information.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The MLA gene is used

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
to miss a lot of

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
genetic information.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So the conclusion is that

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
the results of the

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
hopes study show

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
better genetic

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
identifications.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
In the parents' cases,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
the parents' effective

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
down grade of the

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
MLA gene is seen.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
The MLA gene is related to

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
the early-childhood development.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
So the MLA gene

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
is related to

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the early-childhood development.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
If you have any questions,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
please feel free to ask.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
The second part

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I want to talk about is

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
the medical information design.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
This part is

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
mainly because

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm working on the initiative.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Why did we start

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
this part?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
The main intention is to change.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
What do we want to change?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Because we often find

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
a lot of information

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
in the hospital or clinic

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
for the patients.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
When the patients go back,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
the family may ask

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
what the doctor

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
told you.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The patient may tell

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
his family that

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
he doesn't know much about it.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So we hope

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
this kind of case

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
can be more clear

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
in the clinical environment

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
in the future.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Many people in the academic world

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
have done a lot of research.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
But how do you explain

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
such a complex and detailed research

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
to the general public?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
For example,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
how do you let the public

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
know why you need

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
or don't need a sample?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
This is actually a very professional question,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
but the general public may not know.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
They can only say

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
don't let me get infected.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
This is why

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
we want to make

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
such a change,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
including medical education,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
medical students, doctors,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
clinical environment,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
or preventive medicine for the general public.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
So we want to start

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
from the information design.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't know

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
if you have any special ideas

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
about information design,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
or if you already have a certain

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
understanding of it.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
In our team,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
it is a multi-professional cooperation.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
We may have academic professionals,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
project managers,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
designers, and engineers.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
This is actually a part that needs

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
everyone's cooperation.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Sometimes when your team is discussing,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
you will find that the interesting situation

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
is that the designers are not

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
professional backgrounds,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
so when they are discussing with you,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
they may have more interesting

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
opinions,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
and you may say that

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I still don't quite understand.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Can we think of a better way

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
together?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So our main audience

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
will be divided into three main types.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The main medical staff

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
is the more professional part.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
It may be like what we usually

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
do in academic communication.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Like what I just said,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
there will be more professional information

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
in the discussion.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
The medical staff will definitely

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
know more about their own disease.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It's not like the general public,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
who may just accept the knowledge,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
scroll to Facebook to take a look,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
or scroll to Instagram to take a look.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But the medical staff must assume,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
for example, I have cancer today,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I will definitely go crazy to check

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
the relevant knowledge of my cancer.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So it will be a little deeper.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The general public is basically

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
you have to capture their eyes,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
because they may not have

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
the knowledge to know,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
or how to attract their interest.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That's another different part.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
In our team,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
we may do a lot,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
including interactive animation design,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
such as animation web games.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I will introduce it later.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Because I want to say that

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
we may use works to share with you,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
which is more helpful for discussion.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
If it's not too commercialized,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
it may be more interesting

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
to do it this way.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
For example,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
we have a great video,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
which was also submitted

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
to the conference

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
of the World Health Alliance.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So the information design

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
is not completely decoupled

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
from academic research.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It can also be published.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Because of my

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
lack of knowledge,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I may not be able to

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
share it with you.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
So I may not be able to

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
share it with you.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I may not be able to

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
play the video,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
but there is a link,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
so you can watch it later.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I'll show you a simple demo.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
The picture looks like this.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
There may be animations,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and there may be real shots.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
The real shots look like this.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I hope you can figure out

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
how many red cards there are in the video,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and there may be some answers

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
or questions at the end.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I think the effect will be much worse.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
So back to our video,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
our production process

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
is basically like this.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We may have an academic team

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
based on facts,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
because we are basically medical professionals.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
The main background of these founders

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
are doctors,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
or like me, a therapist.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
So we are all professionals.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Of course, we don't want to

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
pass wrong information like an underground radio station.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
This is our first commitment.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The second commitment is to make it clear.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
So we hope that

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
even your grandma can understand it.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
These are our two main commitments.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Then we make this kind of related video.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
In this part of the video,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
our process will be

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
what I just said.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
First, the academic team will finish

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
our basic search documents,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and then there will be some facts.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Then it will be transformed into

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
an interesting line,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and then we will talk about

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
how to draw the boundary,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and then collaborate with the animation designer

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
to produce the final result.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
In this part,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I still have a lot of works left,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
but I want to talk about

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
some terms first.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Some people may already know

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
these terms,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
but we can still talk about them a little bit.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
For example, what is social media?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Because this is very important

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
now.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Of course, everyone will think of

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Facebook or Instagram.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
But in fact, a long time ago,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
in our ancient times,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
there were already bad cows or PTT.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
In fact,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
these are also so-called social media.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
There may be different styles

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and different things suitable for each social media.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
For example, on PTT,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
it may be very suitable for reading a lot of text.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
On Facebook and Instagram,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
it may need some graphic support.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
On Instagram,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
it may be mainly based on some beautiful photos.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
The definition of social media

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
is basically

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
the technology of computer media,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
which is to use a computer

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
interaction device as a base.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
As long as you can use this

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
to interact with the community,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
it basically counts.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
There are a lot of social media

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
like this.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't know how many you can recognize,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
but what we are listing now

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
are all social media,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
including Facebook, IG, LinkedIn,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and even Douyin and Dcard.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
In addition,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
when we do this,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
we also have to consider our target audience.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
In fact, I think

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
it's the same when I do academic research.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
If I tell my community

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and tell the general public,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
basically what I want to do

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
should be a different form.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Of course,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
as we just quickly talked about

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
, I used a lot of content

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
when I was in Defense.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
What about the target audience like this?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
We can see that

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
different age groups

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
are using instant communication software

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
or social network.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
In fact, what everyone is familiar with is different.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
For example,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Facebook currently has more

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
slightly older age groups,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and everyone is more familiar

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
with these two on Line.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
But most of you are students on Dcard.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
What kind of presentation do you want to use

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
in front of different audiences?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Another point is

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
the part of the legal common sense.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Because different laws are easy to violate,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
so whether it's

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the Intellectual Property Rights Act

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
or we are doing some

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
introduction,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
will it step on the line of medical advertising

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
or be related to contract writing?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
For example,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
can we just use a picture on the Internet?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
In fact, this part is also mentioned

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
because it is especially related to

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
our academic world.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It is said that in schools or educational institutions,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
you can broadcast

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
other people's public publications

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
within a reasonable range of education.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
In other words,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
many professors

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
may take pictures

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
in this book,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
but they can't draw

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
all these pictures

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
by themselves.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It must be explained to everyone

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
in this way.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
In addition,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
we have a mechanism

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
called Creative CC.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It will show six pictures

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
as shown here.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
For example,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
if you see a person in this picture,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
it means that as long as you have a name,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
you can use

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
my work.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
For example,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
a picture or some articles

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
in your own PowerPoint.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
For example, it says NC,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
non-commercial use.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It means that you can only use it

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
if it is not for commercial purposes.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Another one is also related to

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
the academic world.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Is it necessary to pass the teacher's

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
or the speaker's approval

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
to record in class?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Basically,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
it is said that it is necessary

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
in the Department of Economics and Finance.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
So if you encounter

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
such a problem in the academic world,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
you can use it to explain.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Since we have some time left,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I would like to introduce

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
some of our past works.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
They may be of different forms

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
and have different characteristics.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
For example,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Professor Chen Zhenhong

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
from Stanford University

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
and Dean Lin Zhaofang

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
from Fudai Medical School

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
often have red faces

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
after drinking.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
This is because

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
there is a deficiency of ALDH2.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So how can we

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
make people understand this?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
We use animation

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
to quickly introduce this to everyone.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
How to measure

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
if you have ALDH2 deficiency?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It is also introduced in the animation.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
In addition,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
this animation also wants to show

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
people in their 50s and 60s.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So it actually has a Taiwanese version.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Because

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
it also wants to show

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
people in their 50s and 60s.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
So we also have an English version.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
That is to say,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
in different age groups,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
we may first adjust the language.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
In addition, we may also adjust the speed of speech.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
For example, the Taiwanese version

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
may slow it down a little bit.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Because our research also found that

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
young people may speak faster.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Older people may speak slower.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
In addition,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
in addition to the animation

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
for the general public,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
there is also an animation

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
for medical personnel education.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It is a more professional part.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Like this animation,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
it actually talks about

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
a RCT related to breathing.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It is introduced in this RCT.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It is the kind of feeling

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I just introduced my own research.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
That is to say,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
what is his knowledge background?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
How did he do it?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
What is his result?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
In this way,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
the animation explains

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
the process of giving medicine

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
to the medical personnel.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
We also give medicine as a meal.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
In this way,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
everyone can understand

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
why we do this whole process.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
What is the preparation of the front desk?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What is the last one?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
There is another one

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
that is more related to the academic world.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Now, in some top journals,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
they sometimes publish podcasts

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
or video abstracts.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
He is a dean now.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
In fact, he has made

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
his video abstracts

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
on the Goethe's journal.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You can take a video

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
and add the introduction

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
of PowerPoint next to it

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
to briefly introduce

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
what you are doing.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
In fact, many new journals

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
like to use this way

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
because it can attract people's attention.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I think you may be thinking

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
about how to make some

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
videos that everyone can understand.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Otherwise, it is like the ivory tower

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
where everyone is locked inside.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It is a pity

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
because a lot of rich resources

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
can be shared.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
In addition,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
we also make websites

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
for ordinary people

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
such as the liver test room

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
which cooperates with the foundation.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
In addition, we also make

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
general medical journals

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
in the form of comics

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
where we talk about

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
liver cancer,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
which is a non-infectious disease.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
However, you can't expose other people's children.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
We use a more dangerous way

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
to introduce liver cancer.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We also publish

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
a series of

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
liver-cancer journals.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
In addition,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
there are different ways of presentation.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
For example,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
this liver-cancer journal

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
introduces a series of comics

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
about what happened

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
to the main character after he grew up.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
The grandmother died at this time,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
so she came down to the earth

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and became an immortal.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
In addition,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
there is a part about the cervical cancer.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
The advantage of this

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
liver-cancer journal

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
is that you can give different pages

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
to different diseases

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and different groups.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
In this way, you can draw at any time.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
If you draw,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
you can design the information

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
that you want to get.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Otherwise, you can't accept it.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
In addition,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
we also have a community platform.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
On this Facebook platform,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
the community platform is basically

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
all public.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
There is no commercial part at all,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
which means that we have no advertising income.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
We also refuse any commercial

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
introduction.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
In this part,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
we actually draw

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
a little bit of our income

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
to make a public response every year.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
For example,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
this part of the Cervical Cancer Journal,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
we designed it

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
like a game card.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
We want to let everyone know

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
some ways to avoid cancer.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
In addition,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
last year,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
we also designed a character named Wu Wan.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
He is a little boy.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
We use this Wu Gu Ji

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
to let everyone know

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
why we can't

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
use alcohol to disinfect

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
or how to wear a mask.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Why masks can prevent

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
us from being infected.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
There is also a more complicated part

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
in the middle on the right.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
He said why

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
this picture of acute lung damage

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
is more professional for professionals to see.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
In addition,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
we also cooperate with the WHO

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
to create a Vietnamese health community platform.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
We can make knowledge

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
promotion in Vietnam.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
In addition,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
there is a micro-hearing interactive web page.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
This is a cooperation between the foundation.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
They want to introduce to everyone

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
that children may have micro-hearing.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
He may not really hear,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
but he may not hear clearly.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
What kind of problems

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
may occur if you can't hear clearly?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
We can take a look at this web page directly.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
We made this web page.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It is a small game.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
He can introduce the background knowledge

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
to everyone.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
What is the situation of hearing loss?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
What is micro-hearing loss?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
This micro-hearing loss

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
may make children

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
can't hear clearly,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
but he can still hear a little bit.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Because of this problem,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
they may

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
run around

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
or move their ears

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
to one side.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's not that he doesn't want to talk to you.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
He may want to hear more clearly.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
So we will

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
design it into different levels.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
He will tell you

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
that I have to get closer to hear other people's words.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
So in this game design,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
you have to move left and right

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
to receive

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
what these people say.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
The more you receive,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
the higher your score will be.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
He must finish

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in this ten lines.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Finally, it will be divided into score levels.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
In this way,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
you can let everyone know that

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
children want to hear

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
what you are saying.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
They don't want to ignore you

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
or disrespect you.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
He is not like this.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You can let parents,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
teachers and people around him know more.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
When the time comes,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
you can even share your score

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
on your social network.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
For example, on Facebook.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Of course, there are different levels.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You can share your score

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
on Facebook.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Let's go back to what we just said.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Interactive games are one of them.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Of course, there are many other forms of interaction.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
In this game,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
we want to improve

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
people's interest and connection.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
In medical education,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
there is a more professional part.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
It's called

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Antibiotics Week.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
It's for medical students and doctors.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The Taiwan Institute of Infectious Diseases

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
has designed a series of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
challenges.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
There is a week's challenge.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You can go up every day

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
to answer questions.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
After answering the five-day questions,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
they will have a radar map

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
to tell you the direction of your score

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
and tell you where your ability is.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
In the end,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
they will tell you some professional tips.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
In this way,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
you can learn more about

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the professional part.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
In the end,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
there will be some activities

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
like a small lottery

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
to boost your motivation.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
In addition,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
there is also a information chart.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It shows

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
some bacteria

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
here,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
medicine,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
and related symptoms.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
When you click on the mouse,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
it will show you

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
the relevant information.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
In the end,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
there are some related

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
activities.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
These activities are not the point.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
The point is how to

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
attract people's interest

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
and present the knowledge in different ways.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That's all for today.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I hope

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
we can have more time

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
to interact with you.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
This way,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
we can learn more.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I have a question.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Do you use

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Intel

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
instead of

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
SNP?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Do you use

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
DNA modification

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
such as

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
epigenetics?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Do you use

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
SNP

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
instead of

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
SNP?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Do you use

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
DNA modification

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
instead of

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
SNP?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I don't use

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
DNA modification.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
However,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I know

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
epigenetics

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
is related to

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
pregnant women.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
In the past,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
epigenetics is related to

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
pregnant women.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
In the past,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You will be able to see this part.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Recently,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I have been reading

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
that Intel

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
insertion and deletion

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
and copy number variation

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
affect

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
gene expression.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Do these things

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
affect

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
similar connections?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Also,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
is there any other problem

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
with your chosen SNP?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't know.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Because,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
like GWAS,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
its design is for common variants.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
So,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
in the case of low probability,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
is it a good way

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
to use common variants?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
In fact,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
we have tested

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
the SNP first.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Because,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
there is a determination

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
that the SNP cannot be too low.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Like you said,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
if the SNP is too low,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
there is no point in testing.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
But I didn't release it,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
because there is too much content.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
So, there is a determination.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You just mentioned

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
that copy number variation

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
is related.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
In the past,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
many complicated genes are related.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
But,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
to be frank,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
we had limited budget.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
So, we could only do

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
candidate genes.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
We did our best to research.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
We didn't do it on

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
present children.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
We did it on autism

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
or attention deficit disorder.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
We did it in a similar way

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
as you mentioned.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Another thing I want to ask is,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
you chose early birth

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
as the sample.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
In some studies,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
early birth

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
is not related to genes.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
It is related

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
to microbiome

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
or environmental impact.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Do you think

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the subjects you chose

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
share similar

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
environmental impact?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Or they are highly variable?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It is possible.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
For example,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
we did analysis on

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
sex,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
gender,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
or the education level

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
of parents.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
We did analysis on these.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
We found that they are

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
middle-high education.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Early birth

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
is more likely to

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
have early birth.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So, their education level is higher.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
We did basic analysis

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
and control

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
on these variables.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
In addition,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
we did research on

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
genes first.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
My research sequence

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
is not the same as my report.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
We did research on

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
genes first,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
but I have to admit

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
that in terms of

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
child development,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
the environmental impact

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
is significant.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
This is the reason why

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
medical intervention is needed.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Thank you.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Thank you for the discussion

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and questions.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Any other questions?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I would like to add

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
on the previous question.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
In the past,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
there were more

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
information collected.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
For example,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
at home,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
they used

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
video recording

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
or tracking.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
However, there are some

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
income restrictions.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Some people don't want to

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
be informed.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
although we know

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
these factors are related,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
we can only

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
collect information

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
as comprehensively as possible.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
There are still

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
many missing points.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I think this is a problem

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
for any child development research.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
However,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
the good thing about the previous question

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
is that it reminds us

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
that there are many factors

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
that need to be considered.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
This is what I didn't mention

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
in such a short time.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I want to tell you

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
what the result is.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Thank you.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Any other questions?

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I'm curious

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
about the difference

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
between the intervention

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
in the day after tomorrow

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
and the interaction

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
with the environment.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
In the day after tomorrow,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
we will see

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
whether the medical intervention

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
is effective or not.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It is a simple

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
intervention.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
The interaction

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
with the environment

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
depends on the day after tomorrow

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
and the day after tomorrow.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
However, there are many different

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
statistical models.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Some use hierarchical regression,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
some use mixed-effect model.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
In short,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
we need to see the main effect,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
i.e., the gene

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and the development,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
as well as the medical intervention,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
i.e., the environment.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Then, we can put it

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
into the model

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
to see the difference

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
in the statistical model

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and the complexity.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Do you want to ask this?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Yes.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I have another question.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I want to ask

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
how do you

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
evaluate your

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
web pages and

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
interactive games

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
are effective

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and how to improve them?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
We think it is good

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
but users

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
don't like it.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
How can you

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
improve it

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
and make it acceptable?

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Many people

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
ask this question.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Sometimes,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
it is hard

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
to collect

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
the information.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
However,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
we can tell you

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
how to do it.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
First,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
if you make your own web pages,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
you can know

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
the traffic

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
and the links.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
For example,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
you connect different links

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
to the same website.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
For example,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I put it on my Facebook

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
or my personal website.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
It can detect

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
which link you click.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Then, you can analyze

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
the user.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Also,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
you can collect

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the information.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
If you use

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Facebook or

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
LINE official account,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
you will have

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
the information

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
about the user

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
and the time.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Also,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
because

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Facebook is

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
a public service,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
we don't advertise.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
If you want to

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
advertise,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
you can design

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
different gender, age,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
or region.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
You can try

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
different results.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
For example,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
if the user is different,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the result will be different.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
For example,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
the number of clicks,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
the number of shares,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
the number of comments.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Basically,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
you can collect the information.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
For example,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
we have a website called

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Weijiao Dangzhang.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It's a little bit difficult.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Most of the time,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
you can only ask

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
the user's opinion.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
If you want to

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
collect data,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
you can ask the user.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Any other questions?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
We have time

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
for one or two more questions.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Please go ahead.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Hi, I'm Xie Chen.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I'm a PhD student.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I want to ask

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
a similar question.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I recently

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
wrote a

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
scholarship supplement.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I need to make

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
a few videos

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
about my research.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I want to

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
ask if you have

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
observed the trend

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
in 2021.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Does YouTube still need

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
to make 10-minute videos?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Or do you need to

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
put some essence in the first 30 seconds?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Is there still this trend?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Or has it changed slightly?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
In addition,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
10 minutes is a common standard.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
But if it's a video,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
they all need to

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
catch up to 20 minutes.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Is there any other standard

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
similar to this?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Can you share

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
some tips or tips?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
In terms of science and technology,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
it's what we do more often.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
In fact,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
it's shorter.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
We usually catch 3 to 5 minutes.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Of course, if you say it will reach 20 minutes,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
it may be

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
a real-time video

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
or a live broadcast.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It will be longer.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Of course,

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
if it's an animation,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
like we do a lot of animations,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you will find that

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
animation costs a lot.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
The longer you do it,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
the higher the cost.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
If it's a real-time video,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I can talk for a long time

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
and it will take a long time.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
This is the first one.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
We usually recommend science and technology

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
to not exceed

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
3 to 5 minutes.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
As I said,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
there is a platform analysis,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
like YouTube.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It can let you know

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
how many seconds

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
most people watch

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
before leaving the video.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We found that

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
if you don't catch

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
everyone's attention

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
in the first 10 seconds,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
everyone will leave the video.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
As I said,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
it's not for normal people

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
who don't like the first 10 seconds.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
They think it's too hard

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and they don't want to watch it.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
They can't listen to it

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and leave the video.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
We want to let people know

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
why they need to listen to it.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Why?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
It may be funny

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
or informative

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
or you can share it

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
with your friends.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Think about

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
what causes

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
them to watch

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
your video

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
until the end.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Another tip is

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
to consider your audience

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and try to catch

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
their attention in the first 10 seconds.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
When we make

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
general public videos,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
we don't know

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
if you want to use real-time video

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
or PowerPoint or animation.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
If you use animation,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
you can make animation.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's okay.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
In the early stage of animation,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
we tried to use pure PowerPoint

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
to make animation.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
It's okay.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
No matter which one you use,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I want to remind you

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
that the dubbing

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
sometimes affects

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
whether people can listen to it

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
or not.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
It's easy to be ignored.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Whether it's

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
quality,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
smoothness,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
or smoothness,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
it may affect

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
whether people want to

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
listen to it or not.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
If you're worried

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
that the speech is too dry,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
sometimes you can

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
add a little bit of

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
background music

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
that won't affect your speech

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
to make it softer.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
It's very helpful.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Thank you.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I have a random question.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Recently,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
the rate of fan-professional

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
is so low that it's hard to describe.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Do you plan to

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
make a community

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
or switch to another platform?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Or use the coordinate force

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
that they joke about now

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
to open a fan page and interact with others

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
to attract more people?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Do you do something like that?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Yes.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Whether it's Facebook

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
or Google,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
it's all up to them.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It's like raising a shrimp.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
In the early days,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
the algorithm wasn't that terrible.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
But now, it has

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
blocked the fan page to an extreme level.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
As I just said,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
some of the things

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I just shared

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
are more about craftsmanship.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Fan pages are also about

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
business.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Basically, we don't expect

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
any business feedback.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
That's why

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
we can't put

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
100% effort

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
on it.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Then,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
the rate of fan-professional

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
will be lower.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
But if it's better,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
we hope that

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
we can build our own website

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
or app in the future.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
We don't want to be affected

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
by the algorithm.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Otherwise,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
you'll never know

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
how to apply the algorithm.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
You'll never be able to

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
catch up with it.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
It's also difficult

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
to spread information.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
But we haven't changed

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
our original intention.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
We've always hoped

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
to produce high-quality products.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
We believe that

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
we can still survive

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
as long as we can

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
move the same things to our website

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
or other places.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I think

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
it's a good question.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
We've been thinking about it.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
The algorithm is bad.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It's not today's issue.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
It's trying to charge you for advertising.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
But we're craftspeople.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
We can't spend money on advertising.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
It's a waste.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
We'd better produce better products.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I think what you're doing

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
is very meaningful.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I hope you can

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
keep doing it.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I have no more questions.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Thank you.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
We hope we can

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
keep doing it.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Otherwise, many people will die.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Okay.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Now it's time to

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
sign off.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
You can leave if you have

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
anything to say.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
If you have time,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
feel free to stay.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
If not,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I'll stop the recording.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Thank you.
