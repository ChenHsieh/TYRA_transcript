00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello everyone, thank you all for participating in this speech from different cities around the world.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Thank you very much for the detailed introduction just now.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
What I want to introduce today is what I want to talk about my research and what I did in the past.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Then there are one or two slides to bring a little bit about how I plan to do this topic in the future.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
For the overview part, I will try to use the Chinese slides and the Chinese way to do the speech.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
For the more detailed research part, I will try to speak in Chinese, but I will use English slides.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Because I'm not so confident in Chinese translation.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
But I will try to introduce it to you in Chinese.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I also know that the background of the speakers and the audience is not the same.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
So if you have any questions, you are welcome to interrupt me.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Then we can go back and forth once or twice.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
If you find that there are still some problems that cannot be solved, then we can do some more in-depth discussions at the end.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
What I want to discuss today is the impact of mechanics on the instability of dyeing.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Especially when looking at this problem from the perspective of cell division.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
We know that we learn a lot of loss division from high school and high school biology.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
Loss division usually means that when a cell produces a tissue, both sides of the cell will have the same number of dyes.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Let me quickly go through the process of loss division.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
In the process of cell division, the dye will become this shape.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
It's a bit like a sausage.

01:40.000 --> 01:50.000
If you fix it in the way of dyeing and look at it with a microscope, you will find that it looks a bit like two sausages.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
In the process, the membrane will begin to decompose.

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
In the process of decomposition, the dye will begin to form the so-called epithelium.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
This epithelium will try to form the shape of this epithelium.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
In the process, the dye will interact with the epithelium.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
The dye will be brought to the center by the epithelium.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Let's call it neutralization.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
There is a very important component called the connective core.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
Connective core means that the dye will react with the epithelium at this point.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
When the dye is well arranged in the middle, the cells will enter the so-called anaphase.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
At this time, the dye will be divided into two sides.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
This process is actually very difficult.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Many people are discussing why this process can be so perfect.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
There are two things that I must highlight.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The so-called spindle assembly checkpoint.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
This checkpoint is a checkpoint signal.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
When the dye is not connected to the spindle, the checkpoint will be turned on.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
When this signal is turned on, the cells will not be able to go down.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
This is the concept of a checkerboard.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
If the checkerboard finds that the system is a little problematic, it will try not to let this happen.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
There is another system called error correction.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Let's call it the error correction mechanism.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
This error correction mechanism is that when it finds that the dye is not arranged like this,

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
There is a set of error correction mechanisms in our cells that try to arrange it correctly.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
In this way, when it enters the process of cell division, there will be no errors.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
But in fact, there are many times when there are so-called errors.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Let's call it abnormal division.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
In the process of abnormal division, the dye will be unstable.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Let me give you an example.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I have two sets of dyes here.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I color-coded them.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
You can see that these two sets of dyes are all connected to the same side.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
The other side is not connected.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
So you can imagine this process.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
If it passes through the post-division and then divides into two cells,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
The dye of the two cells will have different numbers.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
We call it aneuploidy in English.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Let me check it out.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's called aneuploidy.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It's quite strange.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
This is a problem.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
There are some problems with aneuploidy.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
For example, if the number of dyes is increasing, it may be able to express more things.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
If there is one more or one less dye,

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Is there no way for some proteins to increase or decrease?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
This will cause some problems.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
In recent years, some people have been discussing this problem.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
This is the so-called homeostasis problem.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Another problem is that the dye is labeled in red.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
In fact, this problem is more serious.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
In this case, this aneuploidy will connect two different cells.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
By the way, this aneuploidy is not only one-to-one.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Because there are hundreds of proteins on the aneuploidy.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
It also has dozens of proteins that can interact with the aneuploid.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
So some aneuploid proteins may be connected to the aneuploid on the other side.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Some will be connected to the aneuploid on the left.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
If this aneuploid is connected to this red situation,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
In the process of separation, you can imagine that

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Because the aneuploid usually has a pull force to pull the two aneuploids apart.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
If this red one is not eliminated,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
In other words, if the error correction is not done well,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Then this red aneuploid can't run normally to this group.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Then it is incorporated into a homo.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So at this time we call it a lagging chromosome.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Because it runs slower.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
What's special about this lagging chromosome?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
In fact, many people have been studying this problem in the past ten years.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Because this lagging chromosome can't get into the main homo.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
So the cells will automatically produce a small homo around it.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
We call it a micronucleotide.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
If you really look at some of its biochemical properties,

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Or the properties of cell biology,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
You will find that it is very different from the original homo.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
It has a lot of holes.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
It has a lot of holes, which means that many enzymes in many cells

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Or these messages can run into this homo.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Then go to decompose this protein.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
This is actually a very typical immune response in our cells.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
If we encounter this problem, we can find a way to...

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
You know, our cells may have some...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Because usually if you look at the cell membrane,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
If you see some double-stranded DNA in the cell tissue,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Then we all think that it may be a virus.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
So some of our cells will have some reactions,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Will try to cut these abnormal double-stranded DNA.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So in theory, this cell will be cleared.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
But if this cell survives,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Those cut off oxidants may be regrouped.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Then there will be a lot of mutations.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So the people in this field feel that

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
If this cell survives, there will be serious mutations.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Is the cancer cell going to use this method to increase its genetic diversity?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
This is a big topic in the field at present.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay, let me talk about some of the classic problems of cell division.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
First, how does the instability of the cancer cell affect the occurrence of cancer?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I said last time that

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The instability of the cancer cell can make some cancer cells regroup.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
It can promote the genetic diversity of tumor cells.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
It sounds like the instability of the cancer cell is good.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
But we found out again that it's not us.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
The research field found that

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
If your cancer cell is too unstable,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
It will lead to some signal of cell division.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The cancer cell can't increase its genetic diversity.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Because it's all dead.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
So there are some ideas in this field.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Is there a so-called Achilles heel?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
It's the heel of Achilles.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Cancer cells can use CIN to increase its genetic diversity.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
But if you give it too much CIN,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Cancer cells are not so happy.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Does this tell us some

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Potential therapeutic strategies?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
If we can make the entire baseline

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
If the cancer cell becomes very unstable,

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Is there a chance to find a way to kill this cancer?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Give a very typical example.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
For example, we now know that the acupuncture point is a chemotherapy drug.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Acupuncture point

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Cells may feel that

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
It may cause these so-called

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
A bunch of

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
The problem of cancer cell division

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So there will be some instability of the cancer cell.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Of course, this is the current idea of ​​the cellist.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
So true or false

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
There are still a lot of hypotheses to verify.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But I'm probably talking to you today.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
The idea is probably like this.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
The second question is

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
How do cancer cells produce unstable cancer cells?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
If you look at the ACS or AAC website,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You will find that those cancer cells

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Or tumor cells, that is, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
In fact, it seems that they are mainly not in the process of cell division.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
If it is not in the process of cell division,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
How does it cause cell division?

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
This is very paradoxical.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So our idea is

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Will there be other ways besides genes?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Will it lead to the instability of the cancer cell?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
After my doctor,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
What I'm doing next

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Mainly discussing

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Does chemistry affect the instability of the cancer cell?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
If you have any questions, you can interrupt me at any time.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
First give an overview

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
There will be a lot of changes in chemistry during the tumor.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I have listed four possible points of change here.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I can't talk too much because this is what I'm doing.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
But I will try to connect what I used to do.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
For example, in the process of cancer cells,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
In fact, it is with its neighbor,

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
The force of contact with the cell next to it will begin to decrease.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Then, the tumor will begin to accumulate some so-called cells near it.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So the tumor will begin to mutate.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Then, in the process of cell division,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
This cell will also begin to mutate.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
There are three obvious chemical changes in the process of tumor development.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
In addition, for example, like the liver cell.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Let's change the system a little bit.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
In addition to the process of tumor development,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
In addition to the mutation of cells,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Sometimes a lot of liver cells accumulate some fat.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
This fat is obvious.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
For example, in the process of fatty liver,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
The liver will accumulate some fat.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Then we want to say,

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
For example, some so-called changes in the nature of cells,

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Will it cause some changes in the chemistry of the entire cell?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And thus cause an unstable cancer cell.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
How do I think about this problem?

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
I use this New York magazine cover as a comparison.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
We know that cell division,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I just talked about a lot of processes that are related to the body.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
How do we think about this problem?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Because we study cell division.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Our perspective is the same as this New Yorker.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
This is New York 40 years ago,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
New York 45 years ago.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
The New Yorker's idea is like this.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I live in the egg yolk area.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Many buildings near the egg yolk area,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Many sell some desserts,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Of course I know.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
After a while,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Maybe it's a little bit of a little bit of a place.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Then go a little further,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Passing the Hudson River,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't seem to care about other places in the United States.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Especially after the Pacific Ocean,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
There are still many strange countries.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It has nothing to do with my life.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm not talking about New York.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I mean,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Our cell biology is also like this.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I am now studying the process of cell division.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Of course I care about the oxidant.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
It's related to the oxidant.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
For example, the point of interference,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Those things.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
It may be very important.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I may know him a little bit.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This spindle pole seems to be a little bit important.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
It's a little bit less important.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Then I...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Okay, let's take a look at it.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Like Cortex,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Extracellular Matrix,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Far away,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Maybe I don't have to look at it at all.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
At least in the past few years,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Everyone is not so serious about this thing.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
One of the reasons is because it's too far away.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Another point is because this system is in

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Ah, the area below this area is already complicated enough.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
You have to add these things.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Maybe this system can't go either.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Ah, you can't get one either.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Some conclusions.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But now the technology has advanced.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm starting to know that

12:35.000 --> 12:46.000
In fact, the

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That's what I'm going to talk about next.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
In order to make this

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Cellular matrix,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
What about the matrix?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Hey, I especially want to focus on this so-called

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Because there are a lot of proteins on the spindle itself.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Spindle itself will also produce force.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
So we want to say,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Hey, if there's a force here,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Will it be a very interesting and efficient system?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Can let

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Do some communication between the cells and the cells.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
As a result, it affects the split of the protein.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Okay, now I'm going to start talking.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm really studying the subject.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Ah, start with the English title.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
So I want to introduce the so-called

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Ah.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
The intersection point.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Between the two intersections.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
In fact, there is a so-called tension between it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
What about this tension?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
We call it Interconnection Tension.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It is a very important signal.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
What about this signal?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Ah, you can tell the cells.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Hey, is this dyeing body correct?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Align.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Or is it aligned?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Is it aligned with a block?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
So,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Ah,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Cells,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Ah,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
So,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
You can imagine it as a dyeing body.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
It's a kind of spring.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
There is a kind of spring between the two.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Between these two intersections.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
That's because the matrix is pulling it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So if it's lined up very well,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It will pull more.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
What if it's him?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
If it's not lined up,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
That's because he.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
For example, like this one.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
The matrix is all on the same side.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Then he might be on both sides.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It will be closer.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
What about this one that is closer to the distance?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Hey, or is this force bigger?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Or is it smaller?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
You can tell us the cells.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Hey, is this dyeing body the correct arrangement?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Or is it a wrong arrangement?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Ah, this is from the cells.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Know that this is right.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
This is wrong.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
What about it?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Then he will use a system.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Ah, there are actually many systems.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But the main system is the so-called Aurora B.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Kines.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
This system.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
What about Kines?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Kines is a phosphatidylmethane.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
That is, it can be added to the protein.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Phosphatidylmethane.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Phosphatidylmethane.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
What about this?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
If you add phosphatidylmethane to it,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Hey, you'll find that this is the point.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
The interaction between that matrix seems to be weak.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
So the idea.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
So the whole.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Ah, the so-called spirit of the error correction.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It's like this.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
That is to say.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Hey, this place is wrong.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Then I'll try to get it out.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
After that?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
This dye system can be rearranged again.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Ah, if there is still a problem.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Let's do it again.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That until the whole system is well arranged.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
After that, the cells can say.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Hey, let's keep going.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Okay, that's the so-called regulation.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Let's just call it upstream regulation model.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
That is.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Li Li?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Become a upstream control mechanism.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Tell the cells that this place should be corrected.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
This place may be good.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Then we don't have to correct it.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Okay, of course, behind this area.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
In the past 20 years.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
A lot of people have been thinking about this issue.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
That is to say.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Hey, why is that?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This force will cause.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It can be a signal.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Then tell the cells that this is right or wrong.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
For example.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Hey, maybe after you pull it away.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
What's that?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Because the original B is in the middle.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
So it's not easy to follow.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Pulled away from the dye.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Pulled away from the left point to do some interaction.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Or maybe after you pull it away.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There is a force, and then the force changes some protein structures.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
So I can't do it.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
This left point is a lot, a lot, a lot.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
In the past 20 years.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
A lot of reviews.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
A lot of research articles.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
They're all looking at this mechanism.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Ah, if you're interested.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You can refer to me.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I wrote a review with my post-doc mentor.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Ah, this review is mainly summarized.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Let me advertise.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
This review is mainly summarized.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
That is.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
How do we use some chemical methods.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
To understand the process of cell division.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Ah, there are some interesting ones.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
The use is from a lot of different research.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
They have some very insightful uses.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
So you can refer to it.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Good.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Of course, the Austrian Regulation Model is great.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
But he also has some problems that can't be solved.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
For example.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Hey.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Like this at the beginning.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
You have to say, hey, if he opens this.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Ah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
He has some problems that can't be solved.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
For example, hey, how does he dye.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
If he doesn't have no interest.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
It will fall off.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
How did he go?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Ah.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
How did he start to do interaction with the anti-water?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because at the beginning of the interaction, the force was also very small.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
So the force is also very small.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That is, by definition, this should also fall off.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
So.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
So there will be a so-called paradox like this.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
The other point is that there is another mistake.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Like I said at the beginning of the time.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
This focus point will be connected to different levels on both sides.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
That.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Ah.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
We don't know if this interest is.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
How to deal with this problem.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Good.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
So there are a lot of problems.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Austrian Regulation Model will have some problems.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Of course, he solved a big problem.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
That.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
So we put forward a hypothesis at this time.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
That is to say, hey.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Will it be a downstream control signal?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Because the whole field is looking at his upstream control signal.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Then we say, hey.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Is it possible to become a downstream control signal?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
To affect the function of Aurora B?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Good.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Then we have to know the function of Aurora B.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
We have to know first.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Is he a downstream signal?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
We have to know what the Aurora B function is.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
There are currently two models being proposed.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
This is what Aurora B can do.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
The first model.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Everyone is.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Conceptually, everyone thinks he is right.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Is the so-called Release Model.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
This Release Model tells us.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
If Aurora B.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
After the loss point is optimized.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
This hammer will fall off.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
So after he fell off.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Hey, look at this.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The loss point is empty, right?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
What if it's empty?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
That.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
He can connect.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Have the opportunity to connect.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
The hammer that came out on the other side.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Hey.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
If this system is effective.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Then he can.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Quickly become a symmetrical array.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
This model is very powerful.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The biggest problem is that there is no direct.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The evidence of cellular biology.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Confirm that this release model exists.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So, uh.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Since there is no evidence, let's just say it.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
That a lot of.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Uh.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Protein storage system.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Invisible system.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
In fact, it tells me that there is a hint that this should be right.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
But.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Cellular biology has not really made it yet.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
This.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
This model.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
What about cellular biology?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
There are different models of life.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
It has been proven that there are diplomacy models.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
This is a bit special.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
It's a bit complicated.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
This model is to say.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Hey, if this.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
What happens after the left point is oxidized?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
This.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
B, he will lower this.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
The so-called lowering of this hammer.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
In the process of lowering.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
This dye will also move to spinopo.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
When he moves to spinopo.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
What about this spinopo?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
There are some enzymes near spinopo.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
For example, A is a good brother of B.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
He will be responsible for it.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
That is.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Is to find a way to put.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Uh.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
This is the point of contact with the water.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The interaction is eliminated.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
So in this model.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
It's also very complicated.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
This model basically tells us.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
What about the Aurora B?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Mainly let.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
The dye is moving.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
It's not used to do error correction.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So the Aurora A is the error correction.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
This.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
With the beginning.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
It's just that everyone's idea is not very good.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Because everyone knows that the Aurora B is the same.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
There should be a problem in theory.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Because otherwise.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
This is the reason.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I think.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
The Aurora B is to do error correction.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
But.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
This is the model.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
This model.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
More.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Uh.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Some evidence in cell biology.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Okay, so what about our project?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
There are two models.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Then we want to know.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
The first model.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Does this release model exist?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
The second.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Physics is.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
Is it possible to control these two different.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Uh, function.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
In order to do this.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Our most direct idea is.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Then we put the Aurora B.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
See if you can stick it to the point of contact.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Then see how it works.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
How does this cell deal with this problem?

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
How to connect the Aurora B directly to the point of contact?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
We have this chemical optogenetic system.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
This system has three components.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
The first one is.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
This probe has three components.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
The first one is that it has a halo ligand.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It can interact with halo tag protein.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
It has another TMP ligand.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
It can interact with DHFR tag.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
So in theory.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
After these two probes are added.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
This DHFR protein will be connected to the halo tag protein.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Then the two of them can do something.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
In order to increase the time and space of special temporal control.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
We added a cage on this TMP.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So the reason for this cage is.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Hey, look at the cage.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So this pink can't bite this pink.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Uh, peanuts.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Then.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
When I use light to put it on this cage.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
This one.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
He can go to him.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Then at this time we can use light to control.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Interaction with this protein.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Then I just said that my main job.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
The job is to connect that Aura B to the core.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So of course I hope to put this piece on Aura B.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
This piece is connected to the core.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So I use this system.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Ah, we put this so-called.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Ah, this tag.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
This so-called Aura B activator is called INBOX.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
He is a.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
He is an Aura B activator anyway.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Then in order to put this Aura B.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Aura B is connected to this.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Ah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Outside the point.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Then we put this point on top of it.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
We chose this.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
We put HaloTag on this so-called.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Ah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
SPC25.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
He is a point of contact protein.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
What about doing this?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
We can do it in a short time.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
In about a few ten seconds.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Aura B is connected to the so-called.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Ah, the point of contact.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Then we can see.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Hey, how do the cells deal with this problem?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
We.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Okay, so the first one I'm doing is.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Then let's take a look at Aura B.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
If we connect to the point of contact.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Let's take a look at that.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Ah, if the point of contact is selected.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
If the force is very.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
If the force is very low.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Let's see.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
How do the cells deal with this problem?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
What about this reflector?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
It's actually a dynamic balance.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
The.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
In this case.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
He is a dynamic balance.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
The process.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Ah.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I should introduce this system.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
This system.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I put this.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Ah, this.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Ah.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Separated cells.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Add a so-called.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
This.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Ah, this is a very powerful inhibitor.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
This is a very powerful inhibitor.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
After this inhibitor is added.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
This cell will form these two.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
The two will not be separated again.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It will form.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
A very star-shaped.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
A reflector.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
What about this reflector?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Ah, this dye is on top of it.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
He will.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
He is his position.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It is a dynamic.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
His.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
The connection of the reflector.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
He will pull him.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
But there are some proteins on his dye.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
For example.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
These motor proteins.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
He will pull him out.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
So in theory.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Ah.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
This dye is a.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Ah.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
A reflector process.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
That's why he's going to be here.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
So if I put this Aurora B thing.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Stick to.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
This place.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
If Aurora B Trigger.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Ah.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
This.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Ah.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
The point of focus and the reflector.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
That is, if he falls off.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
What about this time?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
You will win.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
So he will.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
This.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You will find out.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Hey.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Is the entire dye running out?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Relative.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
If he triggers a decay.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
That's it.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Because we know that the reflector decays.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Will produce a lot of pull.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
That.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
So.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
If he triggers a decay.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
That.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
At this time.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
This dye should pull inwards.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
So we can start.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Ah.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
The dye is going out.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Or go inside.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
To explore.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Which model is right.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Ah.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
This is our experiment process.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Is.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Hey.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
This is.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
For example.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
This channel on the left.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Is a.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Ah.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Is.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
The so-called.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Point of focus and.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I also labeled.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
That spindle pole.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
On the right.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Is.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
He can activate.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
That.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
At the time equal to zero.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
You will find that.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Hey.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
This one.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
The system.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
That he.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
In the signal inside.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
In fact, it is quite uniform.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
But after t equals zero.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
If you activate this.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Cell.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You will find that.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Hey.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
This.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Aurora B or Inbox.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
He.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Inbox or Aurora B.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
He will stick directly to this point of focus.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
In a minute.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
This phenomenon can be completed.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
That.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
You find that.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Hey.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
After he stuck it up.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
The whole point of focus.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Go inside.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Okay.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
So.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Hey.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
We put.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
We.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Uh.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Collect a lot of data.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Data.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Data.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Then we found that.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Hey.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
In fact.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Most of the cells.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
In fact, they all run inwards.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Ah.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Here.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Uh.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Coordinate.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
A little change.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
It means going up.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Ah.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
In a minute.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Because.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
In order to match the data afterwards.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
So.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
You will find that.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Hey.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Aurora B.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
He will let the cells.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Ah.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
This mk14.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
mk14.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
He is a.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Ah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
It will decouple.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
One of the anti-Claustrophobic enzymes.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
So I put.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I recoup mk.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Because he is.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Then he.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Also.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Also run inwards.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
So.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
If recoup Aurora B.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
With recoup mk.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Tell us.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Similar.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
If the phenomenon.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Then I can say.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Hey.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Aurora B.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Is not it.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Is caused.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Anti-Claustrophobic decoupling.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
So.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
It seems to be more correct.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
At least in this.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
He can also.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Be born.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Because he can decouple anti-Claustrophobic.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
In fact, he can also be used.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
To control some anti-Claustrophobic.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
That.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
This is also my future.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
I plan to use this system.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
To.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
To explore some cells.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
This is anti-Claustrophobic.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Some problems in mechanics.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
But anyway.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
This is our current.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
No need to discuss this mk problem.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Okay.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
So.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
The second.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
I want to say.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Hey.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Then I know.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Aurora B.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Will deploy.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Then.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
If.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
My second question is.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Hey.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
If in.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Ah.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Aurora B.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Will do the same thing?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
In order to explore this problem.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I want to put Aurora B.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Stick to.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
A.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Hammer.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Ah.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Stick to a.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
On the point.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Another point.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't want to stick to it.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Then you can imagine.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
If Aurora B.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Trigger.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Release.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Then.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
At this time.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
The other side of the.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
That.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
The anti-Claustrophobic.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Will pull the entire dye body to the other side.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
That.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Relative.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
If.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
He triggered.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Deformation.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Then.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
It's the same.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
From the direction.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
We can.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
To explore.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Which model.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Is right.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Okay.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
This is our example.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You can also look at this video.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
So it's the same.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
At the same time.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Hey.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
This.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Aurora B.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It's a.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Ah.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Even distribution.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
At the same time.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm going to figure out a way to.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Stick Aurora B.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
To this one.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
You should be able to see this.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
There are two.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
This is possible.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Then I'll figure out a way to stick this one.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
The point.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Hey.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
About.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
A minute.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Less than a minute.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
The signal is saturated.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
After that, you'll find out.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Hey.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
In fact, this.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Uh.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
The dye.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
He didn't run away right away.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
He's still there.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
After two or three minutes.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Slowly.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Run over.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Hey.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
So tell us.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Hey.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
It seems to be released.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
It seems to fit better.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Is.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
After you hit it.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
It seems that he ran to the other side.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
So it seems to be released.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
More correct.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
That.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I put it.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
We.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Let's take a look at 1m.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
When this.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
The dye.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
After leaving this middle plate.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Let's fix this cell.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Then we take it to 1m.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Let's take a look at the bottom.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Hey.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Is it.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
On both sides.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Is it.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Uh.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Is it.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Is it.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Uh.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Is it.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Is it.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Is it.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Is it.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Is it.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Is it.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Is it.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Is it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Is it.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Is it.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Is it.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Is it.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Is it.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Is it.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Is it.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Is there a waterproofing on both sides of the magnetic point?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Then we found that if this.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Magnetism.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Ah.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
If this magnetic point is connected to Aurora B.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Hey.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
There is no magnetism above.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
But if the other side, I did not activate it.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
That.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
So he doesn't have it up there.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Aurora B.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
There are more than a dozen.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Several.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
There are more than a dozen.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Ah.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Ah.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
The so-called magnetism.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
That.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Here is only one slide.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
As it is only about 5.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
But there are other times.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
There are other.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
The.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
The.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
So hey.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
So Aurora B.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Activation.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
It will really cause release.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
At least in this case.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Then you may find out.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Hey.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
It seems that I found two different.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Ah.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Mouth to mouth.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Is.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Found two different.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Function.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
So how do we discuss.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
You see in the monopole spindle.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
It seems to be a trigger.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Deprecation.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
But in.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
High tension or bipolar spindle.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
It triggers release.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
So we started to think.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Hey.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Is it.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Magnetism.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Ah.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
What about the magnetic force on the magnetic point?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Will tell Aurora B.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
To do this.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I'll explain to you guys later.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Ah.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Okay.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
For.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Explore this.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Is this the problem of tension?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Then I just wanted to say.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Hey.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Let's use a.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Use some chemical drugs to go.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Ah.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
To change his.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Ah.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Tension.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
So let's use these two.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Inhibitor.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
These two.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
For.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You'll find out.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
The distance from his defective point.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Lower.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
OK, tell me.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
That's what tells me that the tension is getting smaller.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Then we want to say.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
When he was small, we sat on the same.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Do it again at the same time.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
See if it gets the same different result.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Then our idea is to say.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Hey, I'm going to make this tension smaller.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Is that not.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
This release.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Will be.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
It's not easy to happen.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Ah.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
What about here?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I did some tricks.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Because we.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
We know that this inhibitor.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
He.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
It may also affect the department.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
It's just two at the same time.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
So we want to see.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Ah.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Explore a little more detailed.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
It's just that we look directly at the release.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
This.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Condition.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
So we want to measure directly.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Release.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Some kinetics.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
So how do we measure release?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Kinetics?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
We know that.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
This.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Like I just said.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
That is, if I hit the dot.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
After that.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
This dot will be here.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Stop here.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Stop for a while.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Then start to go in the other direction.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
So I just put this.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Ah.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
This.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Trace it.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Record it.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
You will find that it is probably like this.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
What about the beginning?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
When there is no fire.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
The two sides are symmetrical.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
But in the process of the process.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Hey.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
The other side is gone.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
So he's on the other side of the sea.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Go.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Then go to the end.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
He will be near the extreme.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Stop near the back.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
This waiting time.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Here.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Tell us.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Hey.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
This waiting time.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Here.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Tell us.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Very useful information.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Because.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
If this waiting time.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
If it's too long.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
It means that the effect of Orabi.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
The efficiency is not very strong.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Hey.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
That waiting time is short.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
It means that the effect of Orabi.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
The efficiency is very strong.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Then I just put this waiting time.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
After collecting it.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Then I took a look.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Is there a case of medicine?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
There is medicine.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Is.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
The force is relatively low.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
No medicine.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
When the force is stronger.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Then we found out.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Hey.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Add medicine.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
This is.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Or.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
When the force is lower.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Ah.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
The effect of Orabi is worse.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
When there is no medicine.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Is.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
When the force is stronger.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Hey.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
His waiting time is shorter.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Tell me.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
He is faster.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
So we know that.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Hey.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
If the force becomes smaller.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
He will let.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
The release.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
The kinetics becomes slower.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Okay.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Today.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Give you a summary.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
That is to say.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Hey.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
We.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
This.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Work.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Get a.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Result.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
That is to say.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
We think that.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
The dye makes the force.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
In addition to becoming an upstream signal.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
It can also become a downstream signal.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
He will release the microchip.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Just try to find a way.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
The left point will leave with the anti-slip.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
In addition.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
He will also reduce.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Ah.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Anti-slip.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Then we found that.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
In a situation where the force is very strong.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Hey.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Orabi will let the left point go.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Ah.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Go with the anti-slip.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Leave.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Go.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Combine.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
That in.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
In a situation where the force is very low.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Orabi will be more inclined to go.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Ah.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Go.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Reduce this anti-slip.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Ah.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Then we.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
From a cell biology perspective.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
How do we explain this phenomenon?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
We know that.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
There are two wrong ways in the cell.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
The same.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
The left point can be connected.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Ah.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
These two left points can be connected to the same.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Ah.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Binopole.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Ah.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
What if.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Orabi.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
At this time, the cell has a problem.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
The cell found that there was a problem with this dye.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Hey.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
He will recruit Orabi.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Then at this time.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
He will deploy microtubules.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
At this time.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
The dye can run to the pore.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
In this case.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
It can be immediately.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Directly.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Transmitted to.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
In the middle of the cell.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
So it will be arranged.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
A little faster.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
This is on the kinetic.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
There will be some advantages.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
That is, the cell biology.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
But.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Another wrong way is like this.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
This is a more serious mistake.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It is a left point to connect two.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Ah.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Binopoles.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
This.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
What about this situation?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
We found that.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Hey.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
In fact.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
It seems like.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
If you buy these three.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
If it's the same thing.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
In fact, it seems that there is no way to solve this problem.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
What about in this system?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Because we think.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Hey.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Is it.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
His tension is higher.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
So, in fact, this.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Mistake.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Attachment.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
In fact, it is in the way of release.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
To relax.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
You can also do this.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
You can do this.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
You can do this.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
The wrong way.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Cut it off.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
After?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
He.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
This system can become.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
The normal.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Uh.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Process.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
So, we think that zhang li.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Ah.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
A very important.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
A signal of downstream control.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Tell the cell.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
To do this.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Or do this.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Ah.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
In addition.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
We can also explain.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Other problems that can not be explained.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Like I just said.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Hey.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I want to dye.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
How did it start?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Connect.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Connect the.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
The.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
That according to the past.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
The idea is to say.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Hey.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
If he.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Orabi.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
When the fire is very high.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
He should fall off.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
But we.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
We can find out.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Hey.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
In fact, he may not fall.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Because at this time.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
You can also know that he is very low.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
He.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
He doesn't have any tension.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
So.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
After he connected.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
In fact, he is not so easy to fall off.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
So.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
This.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
We just.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Somehow.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
That is.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Resolve this problem.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Hey.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
I just talked about this.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
If you have this.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Cell.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Uh.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
If you are interested in the micro-surgery.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Hey.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
You are welcome to refer to my article.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Just released today.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Okay.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
So.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
We know that the changes in the mechanics of the cells.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It will affect the instability of the dye.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
So my main topic now.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
It is to discuss that the skin.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Uh.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Just like I just said.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
That is.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
The cancerous process of the skin cell.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
In the process of cancer cells.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
In fact, there are some changes in the mechanics.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Then we think.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Hey.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
For example.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Cell.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
I just said.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Or the tension between the cell and the tissue becomes smaller.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Then everyone already knows that this process.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
It may cause an instability of the dye.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Then let's think about it.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Hey.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
I just explained it.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
That is.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Cell.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
The tension in the micro-surgery will also cause problems.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
The tension outside the cell will also cause problems.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Then we think.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Hey.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
The tension inside the cell and outside the cell.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Is there a certain degree of coupling?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
The so-called connection.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Okay.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
The other question is.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Hey.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
What about the division cell?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
I said.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
It.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
It usually becomes harder.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
What about the cell tissue?

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
It also becomes more.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
The cell tissue also becomes harder.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Then we want to say.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Is this process?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The hardening process of cell division.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
It can help this cancer cell.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
In.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
In this harder environment.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
You can go.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
To split.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Because we also know that.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
If you go to suppress this cell.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
You find out that he.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
It's like.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
The dye can't be arranged in the middle plate.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
So.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
It will cause some split problems.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
So.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Let's talk about this.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Hardening.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
The hardening process of split cells.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
From whether or not.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Let the cells grow in this harder environment.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
This question is more like.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
The problem of fatty liver.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
That is to say.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
We hope to know that.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Uh.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
In the process of fatty liver or liver hardening.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Uh.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The inside of the liver cell will produce a UTI accumulation.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
It will also produce some hardening accumulation on the outside.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Then we want to say.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
These so-called constraints inside.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
The outside of this.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Constraints of cell division.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Is it possible?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Is there some interaction?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Then it leads to the whole.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
The cancer cell becomes the cancer process.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Of course, there is no so-called.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
The study of the mouth.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Now I just feel that.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Hey.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Uh.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Fat liver.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Liver hardening liver cancer.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It seems to be a high-level mouth.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
That.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
So this part is still a bit like open question.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Uh.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Ah.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Then I want to be now.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
That is.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
This process.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
In fact, there are a lot of people helping me.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Like, for example.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Ah.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Our lab.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
There are two of these.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
In fact, at the beginning.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Uh.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Helped me build a lot of systems.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
So.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
I'm just a human.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Will put.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Put these things in the end.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
A process.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Just put it together.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
So.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
I have a lot of credit for this.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
He.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
He.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
At least do a lot of work.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
So I.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Save a lot of time.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Of course, I also have some work.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
There are some people.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
For example.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
He is.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Do some organic chemistry synthesis.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
He can synthesize those light.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Some of the light chemistry.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Uh.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Materials.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
It can be used to make light.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Can be used to control.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
That.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Because I can't do this myself.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So I have to give them a little credit.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
What about the other one?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
He is in a university in New York.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Ah.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Then they.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
This lab.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
It's amazing.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
What about, uh.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
It's amazing to do that.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
It's amazing to do that.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Then we just put our sample.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
After fixing it.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
And then send it directly to them.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
They can watch em.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Then, uh.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
There's always going to be some beautiful results.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
So I have to.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Thank them.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Of course, this.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
The dust has a very strong.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Comma members.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
He.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
This.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Comma has five levels.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Including our level.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
So these labs.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Some are doing cell biology.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Some are doing.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Ah.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Some do biochemistry, computer physics.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
He has done bioengineering.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Then.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Let's discuss the problem of cell division together.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
So I think these teams.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
It's.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
It's.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
It's really strong.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
So I, I highly recommend that if you're looking for a blog post.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
You can go to these labs.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
If you're interested in cell division.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
You can come and have a look at the background.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
And of course, there are some so-called, uh.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
That's probably what I'm talking about today.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Thank you.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
OK.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Thank you.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Uh, that.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
What's the problem?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Uh, you still.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Hey.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm sorry.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
I'm sorry.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm sorry.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
I'm sorry.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I'm sorry.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm sorry.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm sorry.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm sorry.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I'm sorry.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm sorry.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
I'm sorry.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
I'm sorry.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm sorry.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm sorry.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
I'm sorry.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
I'm sorry.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm sorry.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
I'm sorry.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm sorry.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I'm sorry.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I'm sorry.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
I'm so sorry.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I'm so sorry.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I'm so sorry.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
I'm sorry.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
I'm sorry.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
I'm sorry.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm so sorry.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm sorry.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
I'm sorry.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm sorry.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm sorry.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
I'm sorry.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Thank you, thank you.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Thank you, thank you.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Thank you.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Thank you.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Thank you, thank you.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Thank you.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Thank you.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Thank you.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Thank you.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Thank you.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Thank you.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
So, I wanted to ask this question

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
because, around four or five years ago,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
we saw this phenomenon,

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
especially in myosis.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
It's...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
or, I should say,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
in ogenesis,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
it only has one chromosome

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
that goes all the way to the next generation.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Then the rest three are omitted.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
So, you'll drive, right?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Only one will remain.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
So, when they're shown in rows,

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
some genes will sense that

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
it's arranged in the wrong place,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
and then it will loosen up the whole process

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
and start over.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So, eventually,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
it has a higher chance

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
to reach the next generation.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
So, I'm curious,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
in myosis,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
is there another layer

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
to control it?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Or is it a very different thing?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Yes, there is.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
We first...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
About three or four years ago,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
there was an article in Science.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It was written by another Japanese.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
He mentioned that

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
he used mouse eggs to make the system.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
You know, eggs are also used for myosis.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
In M1,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
after myosis,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
it will be divided into four cells.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
He found that some components

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
will make some of its genes...

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
will make some of the colored cells

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
more flat,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
or the dead spot is more likely

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
to stay in the egg.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Yeah.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Then he found some phenomena.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
For example,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
for example, the iris

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
will actually have an asymmetry.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But this may just be the mouse.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I don't know if there is

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
such a phenomenon in the opposite color.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
But I know the mouse has this.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Myosis will have additional controls.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
For example, the iris will have an asymmetry.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Then its size...

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The size of the left eye

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
will also affect its problem.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Because the size of the left eye

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
is like what we just talked about.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
MKEG, Deployment,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
will also have different activities.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So myosis is indeed more complicated.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
So now everyone in this field

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
is actually mainly going that way.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Ah, I can't be a mouse.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I don't want to be a mouse.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
So I didn't go that way.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I went the other way.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
But your question is very...

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
On the point.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
I have to say.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Thank you.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
OK.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Questions?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Before asking questions,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
please introduce yourself.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Everyone knows you.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I want to ask a question.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
OK, please say.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I am an outsider.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
But I still want to ask a question.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Oh, OK.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
You just mentioned

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
the intercellular and

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
external cells.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
According to my understanding of intercellular biology,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
there will be a cell membrane.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
The cell membrane is actually quite strong.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
What is the mechanism for coupling?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I know that

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
there will be some holes on the surface.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
It will allow some things

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
to enter the cells.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
But I don't know

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
if this thing

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
may be some...

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
There may be substances in it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
But I don't know

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the coupling of tension.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
What is the possible mechanism?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
This question is really great.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
I have to say this question.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
In fact, people in this field

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
are thinking very seriously.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
But they have never thought of a way.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
There is no good mechanism

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
to solve this problem.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Let me tell you

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
a few possibilities.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
If you look at it from the perspective of mechanics.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Let's say this.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Someone in my class is doing this.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
That is to say, you know.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
In fact, the magnet will move.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And it will swing.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
This process is because

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
there are some proteins on the cell membrane

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
that will pull it.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
In fact, there are many groups

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
that have been doing this for more than ten years.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Many engineers have done this.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
They found that

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
if you change the cell tissue on the outside.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
For example, integrin

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
or those adhesion molecules.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
In fact, the direction of the magnet

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
will change with the distance.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Of course, you can ask a question.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
How did this happen?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
It may happen

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
because these molecules

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
may cause some

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
small molecules to gather.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
The small molecules are not actually magnets.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It's the cortex around it.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
There is another cytoskeleton on the cortex.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
It's called actin.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It may be in the process of gathering.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
It also gathers those things that will connect to the magnet.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So it will relatively

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
zoom in on this path.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
This is one possibility.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Another possibility is

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
some regulations like biochemistry.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
For example, those molecules

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
will actually induce some

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
message transmission.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Those message transmissions may make

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
some signals of the entire cell.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
For example,

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
it may make some

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
places easier to decompose.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
At this time, the tension will increase.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
So there are some

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
of these two models.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
In fact, everyone doesn't quite understand.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
But I already know that there is such a phenomenon.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
That is to say,

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
what did you change outside?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
In fact, the spindle pole will change.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Now our question

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Actually, my question is not very

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
so-called

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
very

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
deep.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Everyone already knows this process.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
I already know that

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
the spindle pole and

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
the magnetic core will be connected.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
I just want to say

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
that these two pieces

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
are not

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
so-called interaction.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
I'm just

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
adding another layer on that question.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
I hope I have answered your question.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
It seems a bit complicated.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I'm not a very good presenter.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
So I try my best.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
OK.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Actually, I have another question.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
But

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
let the audience ask first.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Is there any other questions from the audience on the spot?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Hello.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Please say hello.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
I am Zhou Jia.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
I am Zhou Jia.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I am from Bristol University in the UK.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
I also do cell biology.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
My own research has touched on some active parts.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
So I'm curious.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Because in your project,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
you mentioned that

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
the tension between cells

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
will affect

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
the performance of magnetism.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So when you train cells,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
will you particularly consider using

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
some different software?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Or

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
will you specifically set

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
the confluence of specific cells?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
In fact, maybe cell contact or no contact

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
may affect the performance of some cells.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Because when I do experiments myself,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I seem to encounter this kind of trouble.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Yes. OK.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I have to say that

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
when you were doing cell experiments in the past,

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
let me tell you first.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
There are several points to discuss.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
The first point

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
is what cells are different and what cells are not different.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I believe that different cells will have different differences.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Because what we use is

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
what I just said

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
outside will affect inside

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
that cell

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
is actually the primary cell.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
This is the mouse's membrane cell.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Then it is raised in 3D culture.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
So I believe that they feel that

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
there is such a coupling.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
If you are studying

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
the so-called general cell line,

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
you know that the cell line has been isolated

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
and raised for several generations.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Basically, we think that

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
it should be adapted.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
It has adapted to this environment.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
So at this time,

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
the coupling may not be so strong.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Because it can split itself.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Because if it can't go through that,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
it can't survive.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
So there are some selection processes.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
So

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
I think

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
but recently

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
someone started to discuss this issue.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
For example,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I know that Sample has a group.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I just started the lab recently.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
He is discussing that

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
cells will become longer

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
in the process of classification.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
As I just said,

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Anaphase will actually become longer.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
This process

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
is actually very important.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Then he did a

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
more harsh approach.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
He just tried to make the cell

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
become super hard.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
So hard that

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
cells can't do

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
the work of prostitution.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
You will find that

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
there is also a strange phenomenon in the mouse.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
I think this is quite abnormal.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
But I think it's quite interesting.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
So actually

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
the direction you just mentioned

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
is exactly

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
what people have been doing

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
in the past five years.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
After technology has matured,

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
people started to study.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
But it's mainly

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
about

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
cells

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
and the so-called

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
3D culture.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I hope I answered your question.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Yes, thank you.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Sorry.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I want to follow up on a question.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Because

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
what we just talked about

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
is like

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
white blood cells.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Especially like cancer.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
If you look at it,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
will it have

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
a very different mechanism on it?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Good question.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Yes.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
So according to

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
the article I just mentioned,

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
what you just said is

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
I use breast cells, right?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
That work is actually

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
a group from MIT.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
But that PI

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
seems to have died

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
in the past year or two.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
But this is a bit unfortunate.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
That group

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
made a lot of cells.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
It found that

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
what you said is right.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
If it was originally in the blood,

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
it doesn't need

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
cell proliferation.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Then it won't have this phenomenon.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
But if it's breast or liver,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
it has this phenomenon.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So it looks like different cells

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
live in different environments.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Indeed, there will be different responses.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You have a good intuition.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Thank you, thank you.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
OK.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
My friends didn't ask any questions.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Strange.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Do you have any more questions?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
If not,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I will turn off the microphone

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and turn off the video later.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Before turning off the video,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
please turn on the microphone first.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Let's give a round of applause

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
to thank Geng Yuan's speech.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
You should be able to hear

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
the sound of the video being turned off.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Thank you.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Thank you.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Thank you.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Thank you.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Thank you.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Thank you.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Thank you.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Thank you.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Thank you.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Thank you.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Thank you.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Thank you.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Thank you.
