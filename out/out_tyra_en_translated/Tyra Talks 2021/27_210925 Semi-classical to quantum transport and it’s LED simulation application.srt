00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are very happy to welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2010,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2021,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and received his Master's Degree.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
During his Master's Degree,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
he worked in coding,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and developed the non-equilibrium screen function,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is NEGF.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is also in his title.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you don't know what NEGF is,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
he will explain it to you later.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
From 2014 to 2020,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
he went to Purdue University, Indiana,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and received his Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
His main job there was quantum transport method,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is the method of quantum transmission.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
His main focus was on nanostructure and quantum transmission.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Currently, he works in Intel's TCAP team.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can start sharing.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me share my screen.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Can everyone see my screen?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, but you can't see the slides.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Can you see the slides now?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's follow the Tyrell tradition.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please turn on your microphones,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello, everyone.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will be speaking in English for the next few slides,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
because the technical terms may change.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My target audience this time is...

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you're interested in this field,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
whether you want to apply for a Master's Degree,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or if you want to know more about this field,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
or if you want to use this tool,

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
my target audience is like that.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you have any questions,

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you can send me an email.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
These works were done when I was studying for a Master's Degree at Purdue.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The funding sources were NSF and NCSA.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I also received funding from the Department of Education.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I wanted to acknowledge that.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I also worked with CELBACO.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This work was done by Purdue's supercomputer,

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
which we call RCAC.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is the result of the computation.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My topic today is optoelectronic simulation,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and I will go over from the semi-classical

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to quantum transport,

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
my different perspective.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Here is my outline,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and I will go over the motivation,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and what's the method being used here,

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and I will show some results.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In the methods, I will go over the semi-classical.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here's a missing label here,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and go over to what's NEGF,

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and what is a beautiful probe,

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and the difficulty of including different processes,

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a recombination and generation process inside the NEGF.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How do we do that?

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will show some results to show,

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
first, the importance of including these kinds of processes.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Also, I will do a comparison.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If we use a semi-classical way to do simulation

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
versus using quantum transport way to do it,

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
what's the difference?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And do a summary there.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, why are we working on this project?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's because what we have achieved so far as mankind,

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
because we have solar cell,

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and also to harvest energy from sun,

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and also we can efficiently emit light

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
through light-emitting diets,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
which is like a really efficient way

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to transfer energy from electricity to lighting.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And to push the boundary further,

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
we need to look into what other new materials are out there,

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
what different new structures we can optimize

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
like the current efficiency.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so, for example, to improve the efficiency of LED,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
we have these quantum wells,

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and then you can see that when we have quantum well,

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the carrier will like to stay there more,

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and therefore increase the opportunity

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to recombine and emit light.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And also we are looking to the novel new materials,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
like, for example, different Indian composition,

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
or maybe some 2D materials,

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and we're looking into these.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, when we are utilizing all these different new materials,

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
new structures, and there are lots of quantum effects in it.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, therefore, like the current,

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and we know that the non-equilibrium Green's function,

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
this method, like it's solving Schrodinger equation

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
with using Green's function,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
it's a well-accepted method.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, I'm going to go over why do we need NEGF to do it.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, what is optoelectronics?

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And so, I think the best way to understand optoelectronics,

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
like it's just a simple PN diet we study in school, right?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, it's usually a bipolar device,

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
where by bipolar, I mean, like,

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
there's electrons and there's holes.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And also there are carriers,

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
like they're in different equilibrium,

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
for example, electron,

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and they're usually separated by a band gap.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's why we use semiconductors.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, having a band gap,

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and we kind of segregate the carriers to two kinds,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the electron is injected by the source, one side.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One contact, we inject electron here,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and the other one is like a hole.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And when they see each other,

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and there's interesting thing can happen, right?

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There are different processes there.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
For example, there's like Shockley-Ree hole,

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
where electron and hole, they can recombine.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And when they recombine,

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
they can emit phonon, as known as heat, right?

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So, this is like a wasteful energy.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When they recombine through the defects,

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the heat is generated and nothing gained.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, the heat is gained, but it's not that great.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And there's also radiative recombination,

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
where when the electron and hole, they see each other,

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and they can recombine,

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and therefore, they can emit like a photon,

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
or we can see light here.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And the rate it happens usually is,

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and there's like, because like,

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
for example, first one,

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
they need to see through a defect here,

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and therefore, their proportion is like proportional

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to the n-type or p-type,

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because one carrier can come to the defect here,

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and to wait for the other person to come,

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and to recombine.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, therefore, their rate is proportional to,

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you know, either the carrier,

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
either the electrons or the hole concentration here.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But radiative recombination,

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it's, you need,

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the rate is proportional to the both of them.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you need to have a high electron here,

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and high hole concentration here,

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to make it happen.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And there's like also another process,

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
which is OJ recombination.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And this is like a three-particle process,

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
where the electron and hole,

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
they can recombine.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But instead of like emitting a photon,

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it will kick an electron to a higher energy,

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
or the opposite.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's either two electron with one hole,

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
or two hole with one electron.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But the result is like a waste of energy,

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and the chance of doing is something like here.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And, yes.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you have any questions,

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you can ask directly,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
or pause the video.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And the other part is a generation process,

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
where the electron hole,

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
at this place,

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
at this depletion region,

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
we can absorb the photon,

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and like create an electron and hole pair.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, all these processes are needed

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
to simulate an optoelectronic device.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, that's what we need to cover,

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
when we are doing a modeling.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, why do we need quantum model?

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, let's take a look at a simulation result.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And this is from this paper I'm co-author with.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is like a simulation result

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
from a commercialized 3-5 LED.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And as you can see here,

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
this line here means the density of states,

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and the color here is the electron density.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, the contour line is the density of state, right?

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And we can see that the electron is coming from the left side,

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and occupying these states here.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And there are holes coming from the other direction.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is injected here.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And they are going to be in here,

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and they will recombine and emit light here.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So, we can see that,

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if we really do a quantum simulation,

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we can see that there is interference everywhere, right?

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
For example, all these pattern means,

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
if you treat them as particles,

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it doesn't capture everything, right?

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So, for example,

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
electron, they can tunnel through this barrier,

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and through these interference.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, we really need to make use of the quantum transport,

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
instead of the semi-classical way.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So, the current state of our tool to do this is to,

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean, the current way,

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, before I published the paper, right?

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, before I was working on this,

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the best way to deal with this quantumly

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is also from this paper,

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
where we cut the domain into different pieces,

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and then we call some of them the red part,

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and also the green part.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, the green part is like equilibrium.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And why are they in equilibrium?

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because usually the source is highly doped,

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and then the drain is also highly doped region.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And when you're highly doped,

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
there's lots of carrier there,

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and they will scatter a lot,

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and the carrier there will be in equilibrium.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, when you are in equilibrium,

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
we can put a Fermi level here,

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
saying, oh, this is the Fermi energy in this region,

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and this is the Fermi energy,

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and there's like Fermi level for electron,

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Fermi level for holes in this region.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And there's also the pink part,

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
where we do, this is non-equilibrium region.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, this is like the previous way of doing it,

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
where we do NEGF inside the pink region,

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and we just put the Fermi level across here.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So, but this method has some defects,

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
where we cannot even calculate a simple p-n diet,

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
because a simple p-n diet,

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
we cannot really tell which region is non-equilibrium,

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
which region is equilibrium.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So, it's really hard to do quantum transport

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in a p-n diet,

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
when we are trying to include

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
all the recombination or generation processes.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, there are different flavor of quantum transport.

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There's like ballistic NEGF,

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there's like the one I mentioned,

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
we cut into different domain,

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
when we try to do the transport calculation,

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and there's like the super expensive SE4,

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
but none of them can have been,

248
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
are able to deal with the p-n diets,

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
like with the recombination processes.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, therefore, a new model is needed, right?

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And also we can see that,

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
this is from a super old paper,

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
why the recombination process is important,

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
is because when you measure IV curve,

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
there's like different slope here,

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and they are in the results

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of different recombination process here,

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
which later on, I will talk more about that.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So, what's the available way to do,

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to deal with carrier transport?

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So, here's like a list, a roadmap,

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
like where you can pick and choose,

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
depending on your needs.

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, if you are,

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
so here, the axis,

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
y-axis here is the computational intensity.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So, I'm going from a super cheap,

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
super fast turnaround time,

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
computational cost,

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
like the semi-classical way,

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and all the way to go quantum,

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
where we need to solve Schrodinger equation,

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and using it on any GF methods.

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, I will first go over,

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
what's the Boltzmann transport equation?

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And there are different way to solve it,

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
like the drift diffusion is the most popular way.

278
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's the first order,

279
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think, what is it?

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The first order approximation,

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
not approximation,

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
but it's a simplification of the BTE,

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the famous BTE thing,

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and that's like we solve it drift diffusion,

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and then we can also use Monte Carlo,

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
like statistically to gather results

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
for the BTE equation.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, what's Boltzmann transport equation?

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's by saying that,

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
oh, there is a distribution function.

291
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
By distribution, we mean,

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
with the occupation of a different state,

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and what does this mean?

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like, we want to ask,

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
what's the possibility of finding a carrier

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
at a particular location,

297
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
at a particular time,

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
with a particular momentum?

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So, if we can,

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
for example, inside a device,

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
there's a different location here,

302
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and for each location,

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
there is a,

304
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm trying to draw this like a momentum,

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
so carrier with low momentum is here,

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and carrier with higher momentum

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is on the upper here,

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and we are asking,

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
what's the distribution?

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How many particles are in those states?

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, if we know this information

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
across time, across space,

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and for different time and space

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and different momentum,

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
we know this,

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
then the system is solved, right?

317
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So, and why is this distribution useful?

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because from this distribution function,

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we can get the carrier density, right?

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because if we want to ask,

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
what's the carrier density at this location?

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Given the F at this location,

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
we can just do a sum

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and know how much carrier is here.

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And if you want to know,

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
oh, for your device you're working on,

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
what's the current

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that you just do,

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
get their group of velocity

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
from the band structure

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and you do a sum

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
with this distribution,

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
then you can get,

334
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
oh, how much current you are gaining

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
at this location.

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So, it's useful

337
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
because we can get observable

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
from this distribution function.

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And how do we solve this F?

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And it's the BTE Boltzmann.

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Boltzmann came up with this, right?

342
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like the Boltzmann transport equation.

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's the governing equation.

344
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So, the equation is listed here.

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I will just try to show

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
how we understand different terms.

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example,

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the first term means,

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
oh, if you have carrier

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
coming in, coming out,

351
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the distribution here

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
will be related to that, right?

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because you have carrier

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
flowing into here or flowing out.

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And the distribution here will be,

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
if you have lots of people coming in

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and a few going out,

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
then the distribution here will be higher.

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, this is what the first term means.

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And the second term means that

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the F means the electric field,

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
the carrier experience in the charge.

363
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And when you are,

364
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
when the carrier is experiencing

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
electric field, it will accelerate.

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And it will change its momentum.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So, here we mean like that,

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
okay, given the electric field

369
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
at this location,

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the distribution, you know,

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it's related to

372
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the distribution nearby.

373
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So, distribution with a lower momentum,

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
with a higher momentum,

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
they can come in and out

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
because of the electric field

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
at this location.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And the last one is

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
if you have like, oh,

380
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
other collision inside a device,

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
for example, a phonon,

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
an electron can absorb a phonon

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
or emit a phonon and come to your

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
this place, if there's a possibility

385
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
like that, then this term is trying

386
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to take that into account.

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So, we have all this

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and all combined. And they can be solved

389
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
really expensively by

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
doing Monte Carlo, by assuming

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the distribution function and you start to

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
run it, oh, how many carrier coming in,

393
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
coming out from different momentum space,

394
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
then it's super expensive to do that

395
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Monte Carlo. So, but if it's still

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
too hard, then you can simplify

397
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
this BT equation

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to a drift diffusion equation,

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
which is saying that the

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
current at this place is proportional

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to the carrier with the electric

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
field and the diffusion

403
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
with the density gradient.

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So, this is, and the full derivation

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
is in this paper here.

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
People who are interested can go take

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
a look.

408
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So, I kind of went over like the

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
semi-classical way where

410
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the carrier and the device are

411
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
like particle-like and then

412
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
they can recombine

413
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
by solving

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the drift diffusion equation and the continuity

415
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
equation. That's how we

416
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
deal with the

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
semi-classical way.

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And now I'm going to step into the

419
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Schrodinger equation and our

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
non-equilibrium Green's function.

421
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So, we all know about Schrodinger equation.

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's like, it's

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
given a Hamiltonian of the system

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that you can solve it and then to find

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
what's the possible eigenenergies

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
inside the system.

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And the Green's function,

428
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I still won't go into details.

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I started to disappoint people here.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But like, I think

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
there are like really useful

432
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
material here and like really, I think

433
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Professor Datas did a really good job

434
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
on explaining what

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
an AEGF method is with his

436
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
introductory material on

437
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
nanoHUB. So, it's all the information

438
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and there's like a

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
famous book. You can reach out to me and I can

440
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
show you like

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
what's the book you need to read

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
into. But Green's function,

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
from our understanding, Green's function

444
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is also

445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
in an engineering term, it's like the response

446
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to an excitation, right?

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So usually, oh,

448
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Poisson equation, the Green's function,

449
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
if you know the Green's function for a Poisson equation,

450
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
then you know, oh,

451
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
if you put a charge here, what's the

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
resulting potential you can get?

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So the Schrodinger equation is similar like this.

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So you put the H psi,

455
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
E psi all into one side

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and then you can solve for the Green's function.

457
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And the Green's function is that

458
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
if you multiply this

459
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
by excitation, then you know what's

460
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the response you will get

461
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
inside this device.

462
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So,

463
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
here, we will

464
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
first go into the ballistic

465
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
non-equilibrium Green's function.

466
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So once you, so first you have this

467
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hamiltonian, and then you can get the

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
resulting Green's function. And then

469
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
by, so here

470
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
it's like the Hamiltonian here, and we can get

471
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the Green's function. And using the Green's function,

472
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
there's like some key terms.

473
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's like the G lesser, which is the

474
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the

475
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
this is proportional to the carrier

476
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
density. So it's like

477
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
here's the excitation you have in the system.

478
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And you have like, using the Green's

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
function, and there's a Gr

480
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and Gr dagger, then you can get the

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
what's the carrier distribution in the device.

482
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So,

483
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
what the

484
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
NEGF does is that we are interested

485
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
in a part,

486
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
only this part of the device. And we are,

487
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
we want to say, oh,

488
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
we only want to focus on this small region.

489
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And then the left,

490
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
we call it, that's a

491
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
contact, that's a lead. And we

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
don't want to care about the information.

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's an infinite,

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
going left and right.

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They are periodically going left

496
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and right. But we don't want to simulate

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the entire universe. We only

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
want to focus on the transistor or the

499
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
LED we care about.

500
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So, given this Green's

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
function, and then we can

502
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
for different contact,

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
if you are contact to the left, and then there's

504
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
like a left self-energy

505
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and there's like a right side, there's like a

506
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
self-energy here. And with all this self-energy

507
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
on the Green's function, you can get what's

508
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the carrier distribution in here.

509
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And when they are in contact

510
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
with the reservoir of

511
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
a different Fermi level here

512
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
on the left side and right side here.

513
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, but the ballistic

514
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and NEGF, there's no scattering.

515
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So carrier will not scatter with

516
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
each other. So how

517
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
do we do

518
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
including all these scattering

519
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
terms in the

520
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
NEGF is like, there's a

521
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
popular method

522
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that's called Butyprobe method

523
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
where it's proposed by Marcus

524
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Butyprobe back in 1980s.

525
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So it's a way to mimic

526
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
defacing, which means, aka

527
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the scattering events.

528
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, we

529
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
will try, when we're

530
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
injecting the carrier into

531
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the device from the left and right

532
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
side. So we're adding more

533
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
more these

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
reservoir inside the device.

535
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So we're taking the electron out and

536
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
put it back in, take it out and put it

537
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
back in. So in this way, we're

538
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
mimicking like carrier

539
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
we can randomize the carrier

540
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and the carrier's momentum will go around

541
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and like you can see that

542
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
this is more closer to

543
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the real world problem where the

544
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
device have scattering.

545
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But this method

546
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
was only applicable

547
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to unit polar device. For example,

548
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
if you only have electron here, it can only

549
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
simulate electrons

550
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
scattered inside the device.

551
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So

552
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
my work, my PhD

553
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
was like to ask a question

554
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
whether we can modify this for

555
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
bipolar device.

556
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Bipolar

557
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
means

558
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
when we have, so

559
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
can we put like two, when we are

560
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we simulate electron and hole

561
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
separately like before, right?

562
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have electron coming in and electron

563
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
coming out and we also simulate the hole

564
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
whereas electron coming in, sorry, hole coming

565
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
in and hole coming out. And we also

566
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
include this probe here to extract

567
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the carrier in, out of

568
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the device and put it back in

569
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and this

570
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
way, if we somehow take

571
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the carrier out from

572
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
this electron and hole and that's equivalent

573
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to semi-classically

574
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
how JIP diffusion model

575
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the Shockley-Ree hole and different processes.

576
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So using this

577
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
method, we can

578
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
cover

579
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the processes I

580
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
mentioned in the optoelectronic device. We can

581
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
model Shockley-Ree hole, we can model

582
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
radiated, we can model OJ,

583
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
we can model all these

584
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
effects inside the

585
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
enhanced

586
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
electrical probe method.

587
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So here is like all

588
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the methodology I've mentioned

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
where from

590
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
cheap to expensive, we have like

591
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
JIP diffusion, Monte Carlo's

592
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and the NEGF

593
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and also

594
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
in the

595
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
NEGF we have like the

596
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
ballistical one and also the

597
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
what's the time now?

598
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Do we still have time?

599
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oops.

600
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh 540, sorry.

601
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let me put it back on.

602
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, so we have like

603
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
all the different

604
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
methodology here and this is the one

605
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I was mainly working on.

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So carriers, they are

607
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
wave-like.

608
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So for example,

609
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
from before, JIP diffusion and Monte Carlo's

610
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
each of the carriers, they are particle-like

611
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and then we are solving

612
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the current continuity equation.

613
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
For each location, there is like a quasi-Fermi

614
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
level, which means they follow Fermi

615
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
direct distribution

616
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and

617
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
quantum correction with

618
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
artificial.

619
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And there are way people

620
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
when using JIP diffusion, you can

621
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
couple it with quantum correction like

622
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
solving Schrodinger equation

623
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
in a certain region and then couple

624
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
them with a JIP diffusion and try

625
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to mimic it.

626
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You will have artificial boundary

627
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
condition.

628
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When do we choose?

629
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Which is the part we want to solve at quantum?

630
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Where do we solve semi-classically?

631
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So there's lots of confusion

632
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
if you are coupling that.

633
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But using NEGF

634
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like if it's

635
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
ballistic, it's not

636
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
really useful for

637
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
optoelectronic because there's no

638
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
recombination scattering processes and

639
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
there's like the way I mentioned, it's called

640
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
multi-equilibrium

641
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
way. So some part of it you

642
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
simulate, you assume

643
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
like there's like an equilibrium there.

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
this method, it requires

646
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
like

647
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
really, it only

648
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
works with, for example, quantum well structure

649
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and inside here, we can

650
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
set it to be equilibrium and somehow to

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
have the carrier recombine.

652
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But in this way, the new

653
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
proposed beautiful probe way

654
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
where the carriers are always

655
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
wavelength and we can have

656
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
recombination generation everywhere in the

657
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
device and we also can have scattering

658
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
consider and

659
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
you don't need to say

660
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
this part is equilibrium or the other part

661
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is non-equilibrium. So you can simulate

662
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
the entire device without

663
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
artificial boundary.

664
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And of course, there's the SC Born method

665
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
but that's like super expensive and

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
no one has, I would say

667
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
like no one has done like

668
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
a simulation like

669
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
LED kind of simulation

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
like with it.

671
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And so later

672
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
next one, I will go

673
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
to talk about the results.

674
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So first part, I will show that

675
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the importance of recombination.

676
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So here is a picture

677
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
showing, this is a structure

678
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
where electrons coming

679
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
again from the left side here and then

680
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
there's a band structure. There's a

681
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
band gap in between

682
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
this and I crop out in between

683
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and the hole is coming to here.

684
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So

685
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
there are two paths that electron

686
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
can, there's

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
a current conducting path, right?

688
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So one path is the blue path where

689
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
electron come here and hole come here

690
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and they will recombine and this

691
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
current, they can form a current path.

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And the other path is the black line

693
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
where the carrier come in and can

694
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
jump over the barrier to the other side.

695
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So there are two way that the

696
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
carrier can

697
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that the current can form.

698
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So here's a comparison with

699
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
or without this indium

700
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
gallium nitride. So when we form

701
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
the quantum well with a lower

702
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
band gap material here. So on the two sides

703
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
gallium nitride with a larger band gap.

704
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
With indium gallium nitride, you can shrink

705
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the band gap and that's why we see this dip

706
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
here. And with this, you

707
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
can see that comparing the two

708
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the recombination current is

709
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
much higher with a quantum well

710
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
because inside a quantum well, there's a

711
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
higher chance of

712
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
carrier here and because

713
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
we also know that

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
the recombination

715
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
is proportional to the carrier density

716
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
there, right? They want to see each other

717
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
they want to recombine. So the more they have

718
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
at each location, the more

719
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
they can recombine with each other.

720
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So

721
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
here I'm trying

722
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
to show that

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
when we do any

724
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
gift calculation, when we include

725
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the recombination here

726
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
this is a typical

727
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
IV curve and we can see that

728
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
this is a log scale

729
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
current, right? So when we increase

730
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
when we increase the drain

731
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
voltage, we are pulling

732
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the barrier down

733
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
so there are more and more current can go

734
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
through to the other side. So

735
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
let's focus first on

736
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the low Vd

737
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
side. So on the low Vd side

738
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
there, you can

739
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
see that there's still a barrier here. So

740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the black current, so the total

741
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
current will be, as I said before

742
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
there's like two parts. There's a recombine

743
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
the electron hole

744
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
they can recombine here for a

745
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
current path. And there's also the

746
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
thermionic current where the carrier can

747
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
jump over the barrier to the other side

748
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
so this is the two part. And when the

749
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
barrier is still high, we can see that the black line

750
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
is not in favor because it's hard

751
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
for the electron to jump out here. There's like

752
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
few particles here to jump out. So

753
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the black part of the current is super

754
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
small. And

755
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
at this region

756
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the recombination current dominates

757
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
so we can see that this is

758
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the

759
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
distribution here.

760
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And when we increase

761
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
the bias voltage

762
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
we're pulling the other side, the barrier down

763
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
so as you can see here

764
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
right now the black path is easier

765
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the electron can zip through the device

766
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and form a current path

767
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
so right now the blue one is

768
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
it's still large but

769
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
compared to the black one it's much smaller

770
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
so this is on off.

771
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So when we include

772
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
NEGF, when we do

773
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
non-equilibrium Green's function

774
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
transport calculation, when we don't

775
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
have recombination, which current

776
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
do we get? We get the

777
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
we don't have

778
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the blue line here so we're only getting

779
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the black. And if we

780
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
using this method we're able

781
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
to include the recombination process

782
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
which means we get the red line

783
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
so we're pushing

784
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the boundary of NEGF such that

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we can simulate the device

786
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
from a black line to a red line

787
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
which is a really large difference if you look at

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
here and

789
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
if you look at the

790
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
before the threshold voltage there's a

791
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
huge current difference with or without

792
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
recombination and it

793
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
also further impact what's the

794
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
threshold voltage. The threshold voltage means

795
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
when is your device on

796
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
or off. So there's a small shift

797
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
here although on a

798
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
linear scale but with more recombination

799
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the red and

800
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
also the black line will have a larger

801
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
shift and therefore a larger impact.

802
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So it's really important to

803
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
include the recombination

804
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
in your device.

805
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Can I ask a question here?

806
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah, sure.

807
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Can you go back to your previous slide?

808
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes.

809
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Maybe

810
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
this is a bit stupid but I

811
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
thought

812
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
recombination

813
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
means you have

814
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
electron hole pair recombine

815
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and I thought it will

816
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
lead to the emission

817
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
of phonon or emission of photon

818
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and usually

819
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I would think

820
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
recombination is bad

821
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
for the current but here you are saying

822
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
when you have

823
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
smaller bias voltage

824
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the VT is smaller you

825
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
actually have higher recombination

826
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
energy, recombination

827
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
current. Why does recombination

828
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
contribute to a current?

829
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
To a current?

830
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Or a current?

831
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So there are different

832
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
recombination process, right? There's like

833
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mentioned like there's a

834
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
there's radiative recombination

835
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and there's OJ recombination.

836
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So they are all

837
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
the consequence of electron hole.

838
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean OJ

839
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
is the radiative

840
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in the shock wave hole is one electron one hole

841
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and they disappear.

842
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And the shock wave hole is

843
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
you emit heat.

844
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, phonons.

845
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And the radiative is like you emit

846
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
photon. And OJ

847
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
is like you kick another carrier

848
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
to a higher energy, right? So it's useless

849
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
too, right? So

850
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
not all. Okay, so wait, your question

851
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
is, but here

852
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is showing the recombination is

853
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the blue line here, right? So when

854
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
your lower VT is lower, when your

855
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
higher VT it's

856
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
higher.

857
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But, sorry, what

858
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
was your question? My question is

859
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I, okay, I

860
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
thought recombination

861
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
is bad for your, for the current.

862
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Why?

863
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's bad because

864
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
it's

865
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think some, well

866
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
bad is kind of like a subjective, right?

867
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I would call it bad if

868
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I would call it

869
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
this is a bad device if most of your

870
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
recombination happens for

871
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
happen in the way, the shock wave hole way

872
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
or OJ, right? So the black

873
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and the red is bad because they don't

874
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
produce photon, you don't

875
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
produce light, then why are you

876
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
recombining? So I think

877
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
bad is, okay, it depends

878
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
on which process you are

879
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
looking at, right? I think

880
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the blue one is good because

881
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I see, I see, because you want a photon

882
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
going, I see. Yeah.

883
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay. Yes, yes.

884
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Okay, and the relation between

885
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
okay, maybe this is

886
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a bit specific, like OJ one

887
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the radiative one and

888
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the phonon one

889
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
black, blue, and red.

890
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Are they always in this order?

891
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Won't they cross

892
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
at some point if you have different lengths

893
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
of the, I think

894
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
this X means the size of your

895
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah, because it looks like

896
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
they always have red, blue, and black.

897
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Do they ever

898
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
cross at some point?

899
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I think I was showing

900
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the interesting

901
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
question because I was showing

902
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
previously

903
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
they have different

904
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
relationship, right? So

905
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
this is an ABC model

906
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
where the

907
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
shock wave we hold there is proportional to

908
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
n plus p, and the radiative

909
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
is n and p, and then

910
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the rate is proportional to n

911
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
squared p. So

912
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I think if you engineer it

913
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
smartly, you can

914
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
control which one dominates.

915
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But somehow in this scenario

916
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the red one is always larger

917
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but if you look at the equation here

918
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's n squared p

919
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
so if you make the p much

920
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
smaller, right now it's equally large

921
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
n and p are super large both in here

922
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
but the real device

923
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think is more complicated

924
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and maybe in some

925
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
way, smart way, you can

926
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
shrink, make the blue

927
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
dominant and the other two

928
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
because relatively they are different, right?

929
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
In this case

930
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the red are closer to blue

931
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
but here you can see that

932
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the red and blue is farther away

933
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
or yeah

934
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think

935
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there's some way

936
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
we can engineer it to make it

937
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
some area the blue one

938
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
will dominate, yeah.

939
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Is there any other questions?

940
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I have a question here.

941
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So I guess

942
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
this case is simple enough

943
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I guess this is probably

944
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
just your test case

945
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
but this case is simple enough

946
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
that you can also use semi-classical

947
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
way to do a simulation

948
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so I'm just wondering

949
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
how do they compare?

950
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So that's my next topic

951
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
it's like comparing on

952
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
this really small structure and then

953
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
we are using a semi-classical way and also

954
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a quantum way to compute

955
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and then I will show some comparison

956
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
here so I think that's the

957
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that will answer your question.

958
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay, great, yeah.

959
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So the next one as the question has

960
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
elevated us

961
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
to this point, so I'm going

962
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to talk about the comparison between the two, semi-classical

963
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and quantum

964
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and how do we compare, how do we make a fair comparison

965
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
yes, that's an important question

966
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
is that we use the same still

967
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the same small, like the structure I was

968
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
showing here is like 20 nanometer

969
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
so it's a super tiny structure

970
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and then I'm going to apply

971
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
semi-classical method, a drip

972
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
diffusion one and also

973
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
for the quantum way I'm using

974
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
this new method, the butycoprobe

975
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
with recombinant generation method

976
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which is the tool our lab

977
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
used to work on in grad school

978
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
so if you guys are interested in applying for our group

979
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
email me and I can give

980
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
you more information

981
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
so how do we compare this

982
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
is that in all the transport

983
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
simulation

984
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
we're decoupling the transport part

985
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
with the part, like

986
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
electrostatic part, so we usually do a

987
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
self-consistent, we solve for the

988
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
where's the electron holes and given

989
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the electron holes and they have charge

990
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and therefore they will form a potential

991
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
so we will feed back the carrier

992
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
transport and plug it into Poisson

993
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and get a potential and like doing this

994
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
like a hundred times or whatever

995
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
it's converging, so it's like self-consistently

996
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
solving, decouple the two

997
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and solve the Poisson

998
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and just keep on doing until it doesn't

999
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
change anymore and then we declare

1000
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
this simulation is finished

1001
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it's converged

1002
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
so to compare

1003
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
it's easy because we can

1004
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
just focus on this part and then for the

1005
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
carrier we can choose to use

1006
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
NEGF or we can choose the

1007
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
semi-classical way of doing it

1008
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and when doing the semi-classical way

1009
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
we also choose to

1010
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
because Drift Diffusion, to solve these problems

1011
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
they usually have another quantum correction model

1012
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
where they are solving just

1013
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
a confined Schrodinger

1014
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
but NEGF is more like an open boundary

1015
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
open boundary Schrodinger

1016
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
equation, but like

1017
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
for semi-classical

1018
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
people, they usually will

1019
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
couple it with a quantum correction method

1020
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
which is solving Schrodinger

1021
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
inside an infinite

1022
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
quantum

1023
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
so they will have boundary, but solving Schrodinger

1024
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
only in that region and try to couple them

1025
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
together

1026
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
so the question to answer is

1027
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
how do we

1028
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
compare the quantum and semi-classical models

1029
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and here is

1030
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
more of like showing

1031
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
so the left side is using

1032
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the NEGF where

1033
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we will have a band structure, right?

1034
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
we will have the band gap of

1035
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think this is around

1036
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
0.4 to

1037
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
so galenitride is like 3.4

1038
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
electron volts, and inside here

1039
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
there is like a quantum well

1040
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
so the actual

1041
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
will be galenitride

1042
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and we assume that it is doped with 1E20

1043
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and there is like a region of galenitride

1044
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and that will have a smaller band gap

1045
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and also the galenitride, and this is like

1046
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the structure we are looking into

1047
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and in NEGF

1048
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we will provide like a

1049
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
total energy

1050
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so the y-axis is the energy range

1051
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
so you know

1052
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
here are some states that can be

1053
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
so here the color means like the density

1054
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
of states, means like the carrier

1055
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
can have a possibility to go in

1056
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
there, but there is some portion of it

1057
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
like brighter, which means

1058
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
because of the interference, carrier

1059
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
doesn't have a

1060
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
even if you have carrier, it cannot go in

1061
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
here, so that's what the density of states

1062
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
means

1063
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the NEGF we can provide

1064
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is non-equilibrium throughout the entire

1065
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
device, which means the carrier

1066
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
doesn't have to follow Fermi-Dirac

1067
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
distribution everywhere

1068
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
also we can see that the states

1069
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is broadened, so because

1070
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
you are in contact with the

1071
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
external source, therefore

1072
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
the state is broadened

1073
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
otherwise, if you solve

1074
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
this in the Schrodinger equation

1075
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
it's going to be confined

1076
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
like a

1077
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the states is like, you know, it's not

1078
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
broadened, but here we can see that

1079
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
for example, quantum well here, it's not a

1080
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
compared to Schrodinger equation

1081
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
it's a fixed energy level, because

1082
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
you are in contact with the surrounding

1083
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
therefore there is a peak here

1084
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and for the drift diffusion

1085
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
we can see that

1086
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
here

1087
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
drift diffusion

1088
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
equation assume that

1089
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
in everywhere there is a Fermi

1090
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
energy, right, and for this Fermi energy

1091
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
follows the Fermi distribution

1092
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
which means the carrier will

1093
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
be Fermi distribution everywhere

1094
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
with different Fermi energy

1095
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and also

1096
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
we are solving the quantum

1097
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
using this Q-well method

1098
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in ATLAS, which is solving Schrodinger equation

1099
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
here, so that's why we can have this

1100
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
red wave function

1101
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
square here, so that's the wave function

1102
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
form, and how is it solved? It's by solving

1103
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Schrodinger equation only in this

1104
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
region, so we are defining

1105
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
a region where we want to solve this

1106
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
closed boundary Schrodinger

1107
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
equation, and we are trying to couple this

1108
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to the drift diffusion methods

1109
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and there is like several parameters

1110
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
for example, in a drift diffusion

1111
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
you have ABC

1112
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
parameters for the recombination

1113
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
like the circularity hole, the phonon

1114
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the photon, and also the

1115
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
other ones, the OJ, so there is

1116
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
like the parameters for it, and we are using the same ABC

1117
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and

1118
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
in drift diffusion, there is like a mobility

1119
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
term, where for

1120
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
NEGF is called self-energy, which is

1121
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the scattering rates

1122
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
in the device, and that will, in a

1123
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
semi-classical way, that's called the mobility

1124
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
so we need to find

1125
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
a corresponding, oh given this mu

1126
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
what's the scattering rate in the device

1127
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and therefore what's the self-energy we are using

1128
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
in NEGF, and

1129
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
for drift diffusion

1130
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
when you are, there is a density of

1131
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
states, and you are assuming

1132
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
you will

1133
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
get a carrier, so there is

1134
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
for different M

1135
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
for different effective mass, you

1136
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
correspond to different density of states, and therefore

1137
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
carrier, for

1138
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
NEGF we are using

1139
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
we can support tight binding

1140
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
different way

1141
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
to describe this EK

1142
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
relationship, so

1143
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that's the corresponding, right

1144
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
we can also use effective mass, or we can use

1145
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
tight binding method, or KRP, or

1146
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
one-year functions

1147
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
so the basis

1148
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
there is a little bit different, in drift diffusion we can only support

1149
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
so this is how we

1150
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
couple them

1151
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
so

1152
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm only going to show that

1153
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
the direct comparison

1154
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
from observable we can see

1155
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
so for example, on the right side

1156
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
this is showing

1157
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the solid line is the drift diffusion

1158
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
result, and you can see that

1159
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
this is the carrier density across the device

1160
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
we have high electron on one side

1161
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and we have high hole on the other side

1162
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and they are penetrating into each

1163
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
into the other side

1164
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and we can see that the drift diffusion

1165
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
here is much lower

1166
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
this is log scale, so it's like

1167
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
ten to the fifth, the five times

1168
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
smaller than the

1169
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
quantum transports method, right

1170
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and the reason is

1171
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
understandable, because

1172
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
when you look into here

1173
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the electron, you know

1174
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
the NEGF, you can

1175
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
what is it like, the

1176
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
when you bounce a ball to the wall, the semi-classical will bounce

1177
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
back, but quantum

1178
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
you can penetrate into the wall, right

1179
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
so you can see that analogy here

1180
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
where you still have some density

1181
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of states inside the barrier

1182
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
where the semi-classical will just say

1183
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
there's nothing, you bounce

1184
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
into this wall and you will go back directly

1185
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
so this is like the ball analogy

1186
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
so that's why

1187
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
when you're doing quantum transport

1188
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
this carrier inside

1189
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
here is higher, much higher

1190
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
ten to the fifth time higher because of the

1191
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
penetration here

1192
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
but otherwise

1193
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the potential is pretty

1194
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
matched here, but the carrier

1195
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
difference here will cause you

1196
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to calculate the

1197
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
recombination rate different, right

1198
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
because you have higher density, therefore your

1199
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
recombination rate will be

1200
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
different, so that's why

1201
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
the potential looks

1202
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the same between quantum way

1203
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and semi-classical way, however

1204
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the recombination rate calculated from

1205
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
which is a post-process

1206
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
using ABC model to predict

1207
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
oh, what's the OJ

1208
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the photon and also the OJ related

1209
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
process, there's a huge difference

1210
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
at lower bias, you can see here

1211
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the quantum way

1212
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
because you have more penetrated electrons

1213
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
for them to recombine

1214
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
therefore you have a much higher recombination rate

1215
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and for higher bias

1216
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
they're pretty much similar

1217
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
but small difference here

1218
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
okay

1219
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and this case

1220
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
before I was talking about a HOMO

1221
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
junction where we're using

1222
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
galenitride all across but with

1223
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
different doping, and here is a heterojunction

1224
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
where similar things

1225
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
are done, we're comparing

1226
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
the carrier

1227
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
density and we can see that oh, there's

1228
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
some difference here

1229
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
right, like the semi-classical

1230
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
we have a sharp discontinuity

1231
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
probably because we chose

1232
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the boundary different but

1233
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
which part should we solve Schrodinger

1234
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
it's pretty subjective

1235
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
so I'm putting

1236
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
all the things here and seeing

1237
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that there is an impact

1238
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
like with or without

1239
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
diffusion like, or any

1240
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
like what's the impact on carrier density

1241
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and here

1242
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
trying to show the recombination with

1243
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in this heterojunction, we can also see that

1244
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
because

1245
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
drift diffusion coupled with

1246
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Schrodinger equation, therefore

1247
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
we can see that the recombination rate after

1248
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
doing this is pretty similar

1249
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so

1250
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I think this is like a

1251
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
positive side about drift diffusion, it's pretty fast

1252
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and with coupling to like quantum

1253
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
correction, it's matching

1254
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
GF pretty well, so it's like

1255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
also kind of giving confidence but also giving

1256
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
saying like oh, drift diffusion is not that bad

1257
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
like you can still

1258
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
quantumly correct it

1259
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
with solving Schrodinger impartial

1260
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
region

1261
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and here I'm trying

1262
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
to show the I-V difference

1263
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
for a homojunction device

1264
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
so in a homojunction device, if you

1265
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
measure the I-V curve, and here

1266
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the solid line is the drift diffusion, and the circle

1267
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
is the quantum well, and we can see

1268
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that

1269
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the off current

1270
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
there's like a larger difference

1271
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
between them, and if you

1272
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
have, if you compare the

1273
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
heterojunction device using the

1274
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and there's some difference here

1275
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and there, but just like

1276
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
providing the comparison here

1277
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and this

1278
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
method, we can further

1279
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you know, solving, we're

1280
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
enabling any GF to be able to

1281
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
solve like

1282
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
carrier generation, because we are

1283
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
injecting the, we can

1284
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
assume the light come in and

1285
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
producing electron hole and

1286
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and give them, separate them

1287
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
to generate current here, right?

1288
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So here's the simulation results like

1289
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
using any GF, and this is like the

1290
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
the first

1291
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the first tool that we can cover

1292
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
all processes into, including

1293
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
generation, and then to enable a device

1294
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
simulation

1295
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So here

1296
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the summary, I kind of review

1297
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
different carrier transport method

1298
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
from BTE all the way to any

1299
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
GF, and providing the references there

1300
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
if you're interested, or can ask, email me

1301
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
for more information, and this

1302
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
is like, this work is to propose

1303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
a really generic

1304
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
method for recombination

1305
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
generation process inside the

1306
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
any GF framework, so we're enabling

1307
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
any GF community to

1308
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
approach problem like recombination

1309
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
generation, and we

1310
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
show the importance, oh, for any GF

1311
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
with or without recombination, what's the

1312
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
difference, and why do we need it, and we

1313
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
also benchmark against like GF diffusion

1314
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
based TCAD tool, and to

1315
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
see that, we can see that the charge is different

1316
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
and with or without methods, and

1317
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
also we can show that there's

1318
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
tunneling and wave phenomena here

1319
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and I know

1320
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and lastly, if there's any

1321
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
study group, or

1322
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
want to discuss this, I think

1323
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
it's very helpful to discuss

1324
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
if you have any questions

1325
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or any questions

1326
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
about this, you can email me

1327
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
yeah, okay

1328
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
is everyone still here?

1329
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
okay, still here, so let's

1330
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
first,

1331
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
everyone please turn on the mic

1332
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to applaud, and thank the audience

1333
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
so now,

1334
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
do we have any questions?

1335
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that you want to ask

1336
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
do we have any questions?

1337
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
if you have questions,

1338
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
just turn on the mic

1339
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
okay

1340
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
okay, I want to ask

1341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
a question that's not

1342
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
that related

1343
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I'm curious

1344
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
how long have you been at Intel?

1345
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
about

1346
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
a year

1347
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
so

1348
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
do you need

1349
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
when you're doing these simulations

1350
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
do you need to

1351
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
communicate with the people doing the experiments?

1352
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
some people

1353
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
some people

1354
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
this isn't my Intel work, this is my study group's work

1355
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and Intel

1356
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
yeah, I think

1357
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
they'll communicate with

1358
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
the people doing the experiments

1359
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
for example, they have some data

1360
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
you take this

1361
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
simulation

1362
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
when you're taking these

1363
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
when you're explaining these simulations

1364
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and communicating with the people doing the experiments

1365
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
do you feel like

1366
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
there's a gap?

1367
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think there is

1368
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
but I think they'll

1369
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
draw the problem to

1370
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
yeah, it's not

1371
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
if they're looking for you

1372
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
they might think

1373
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
this might be related

1374
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
so for example

1375
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
like

1376
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
when you're doing these simulations

1377
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments

1378
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
can you compare with the people doing the experiments?

1379
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
or are there some

1380
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
trends

1381
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
when you're explaining the experiments

1382
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
how do you

1383
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments

1384
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
how do you

1385
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
how do you

1386
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
work with the people doing the experiments?

1387
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it's a bit abstract, I don't know how to explain it

1388
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
for example

1389
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
can you use these tools

1390
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to explain their data?

1391
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
or can you provide

1392
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
based on this data

1393
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
maybe an improved direction

1394
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
is this doable?

1395
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that kind of feeling

1396
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
sorry, it's a bit abstract

1397
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I think it is

1398
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
let me use Boban as an example

1399
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Boban's project

1400
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
people might say

1401
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
is it because of the recombination

1402
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
causing the current to get smaller or more

1403
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
if you make the defects level

1404
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
bigger or smaller

1405
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I think it's more of a trend

1406
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
if you increase the defects

1407
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
can you see the curve

1408
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
100% match the experiment data

1409
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
but you might say

1410
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
if this phenomenon

1411
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
more defects, will my recombination rate get bigger or smaller?

1412
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
you can experiment

1413
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
experiment and simulate

1414
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think a lot of problems

1415
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
are not that

1416
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
you need to model

1417
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
to say it's really this phenomenon

1418
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
you might observe

1419
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
the current getting bigger

1420
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but you don't know why

1421
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
you might say

1422
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
you can make this adjustment

1423
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
or add stress

1424
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
there are a lot of things you can change

1425
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
in simulation, there are a lot of parameters you can change

1426
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you might adjust the defects level

1427
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
or adjust

1428
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
all kinds of parameters

1429
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
to confirm

1430
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I think this feedback

1431
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
is quite important

1432
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
to identify

1433
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
if what you said is right

1434
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I think you can verify

1435
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
if it's correct

1436
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
another question

1437
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I know you are talking about

1438
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
what Boban did

1439
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
another question

1440
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
after you joined Intel

1441
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
do you think you are much better than Boban?

1442
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I think I'm much better

1443
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I feel

1444
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
much better

1445
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
so actually

1446
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I think this thing

1447
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
is

1448
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
already

1449
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
considered

1450
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
a simple geometry

1451
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but it can be

1452
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
considered as a real device

1453
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
quantity

1454
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
after you joined

1455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
you will find

1456
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
there are a lot of differences

1457
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
it's just

1458
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the research field is different

1459
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think the form

1460
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
is similar

1461
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you mostly look at the paper

1462
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and see what model you can use

1463
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
but I feel

1464
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in Boban's case

1465
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
the professor tells you

1466
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
what to do

1467
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
it's more specific

1468
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
but in the company

1469
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
it's hard to say

1470
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I want to say

1471
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm also in the TK department

1472
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm working at TSMC

1473
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I actually

1474
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
know a bit about this field

1475
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
but now

1476
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
maybe I shouldn't ask

1477
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
my problem is

1478
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
when I talk to Boban

1479
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
he always says

1480
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
you are right

1481
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
these things

1482
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
need to be discussed

1483
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I feel

1484
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
it's hard

1485
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I don't know if Intel

1486
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
feels the same

1487
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
different companies

1488
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
might have different

1489
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I won't

1490
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I won't

1491
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
talk to an experimenter

1492
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I might talk to an intermediary

1493
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
it's different

1494
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
any other questions?

1495
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I want to ask

1496
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
the simulation

1497
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
looks simple

1498
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and

1499
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
it looks like

1500
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
using Boltzmann's

1501
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
equation can be done

1502
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
even though you need

1503
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
some approximations

1504
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
but

1505
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm thinking

1506
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
the advantage of this

1507
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
is it's more effective

1508
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
on more difficult

1509
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
devices

1510
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
but I feel

1511
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in BTE

1512
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
let's say it's particles

1513
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
if it's particles

1514
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
can you simulate

1515
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
these details?

1516
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
you can't

1517
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
so if it's particles

1518
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
you're missing a lot of details

1519
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
but the result I'm showing

1520
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
is that some drift diffusion

1521
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
is a lot worse

1522
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
some are similar

1523
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but

1524
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean

1525
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
how do you know your future device

1526
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
when it's particles

1527
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
will you miss

1528
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
some important details

1529
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think BTE

1530
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
can't be replaced

1531
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
even in this small device

1532
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
you can't say BTE is correct

1533
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
did you say BTE or drift diffusion?

1534
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
drift diffusion

1535
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
you mean

1536
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Monte Carlo solve BTE

1537
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but even so

1538
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
like interference

1539
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
or tunneling

1540
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
BTE

1541
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you can't figure it out

1542
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
you need a lot of correction models

1543
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
BTE is how to scatter particles

1544
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
you need to calculate

1545
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
you need to add a lot of calculations

1546
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
but NEG

1547
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
you throw the device in

1548
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
the result is

1549
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
low density of state

1550
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
there's a pattern

1551
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but BTE can't figure it out

1552
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I see

1553
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
but the pattern you drew

1554
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
is this equilibrium?

1555
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
like

1556
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
this is

1557
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
density of state

1558
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
what do you mean?

1559
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
density of state is

1560
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
density of state under equilibrium

1561
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
density of state and

1562
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
is it equilibrium are separate

1563
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
because density of state

1564
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
doesn't have so many states

1565
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
equilibrium means

1566
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
you have a distribution function

1567
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Fermi-Dirac distribution

1568
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
the bottom is 1

1569
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the top is 0

1570
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
so given this density of state

1571
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
you fill the Fermi-Dirac distribution

1572
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
drift diffusion

1573
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
means any device

1574
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
is Fermi-Dirac

1575
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
let me draw

1576
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
let me see

1577
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
which one is better

1578
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
like this

1579
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
drift diffusion

1580
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you have a Fermi-Level

1581
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
this is Fermi-Level

1582
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
your distribution is

1583
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
this is 1 and this is 0

1584
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
this is distribution

1585
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
0 to 1

1586
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
any position

1587
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
is bound by Fermi-Level

1588
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Fermi-Level is lower here

1589
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Fermi-Level is lower here

1590
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
my distribution is like this

1591
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
to here

1592
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
there may be some small changes

1593
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
NEG means

1594
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
carrier distribution

1595
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
any place is not necessarily Fermi-Distribution

1596
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
you are very free

1597
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
particle you want to be higher

1598
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
you want to be lower

1599
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
your distribution may be like this

1600
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
not necessarily Fermi-Distribution

1601
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but now we are bound by contact

1602
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
in the middle of the device

1603
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
is it

1604
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
how much will the distribution change

1605
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
your carrier is from the left

1606
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
your left is Fermi-Distribution

1607
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
right

1608
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
this is Fermi-Distribution

1609
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
but when your carrier

1610
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
travel to here

1611
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
will you change

1612
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you bounce around

1613
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
bounce here

1614
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
you may not be Fermi-Distribution

1615
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
this is the advantage of NEG

1616
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you will not be limited by drift diffusion

1617
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
you are bound

1618
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
you have to distribute like this

1619
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
understand

1620
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
ok

1621
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
any more questions

1622
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
if not

1623
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I want to ask the last question

1624
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
you are

1625
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in the second slide

1626
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
you talked about

1627
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
photon absorption

1628
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
your photon absorption

1629
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
is only in the middle

1630
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
in the middle

1631
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
junction

1632
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
or the whole system

1633
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
is affected by photon

1634
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
this is a toy model

1635
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
so I only hit

1636
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
the green area

1637
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I should be

1638
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
later I will publish another paper

1639
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
but

1640
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I assume

1641
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
only hit a certain area

1642
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
from here to here

1643
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
plus generation rate

1644
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
how do you

1645
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
deal with photon

1646
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
how do you

1647
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
deal with photon

1648
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I didn't simulate photon

1649
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
because of photon

1650
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
the electrons and electrons

1651
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
will run out every second

1652
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
so I didn't simulate photon

1653
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
suppose photon is absorbed

1654
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
one photon

1655
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
you just

1656
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
move it up

1657
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
one photon

1658
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
suppose

1659
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it moves up

1660
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
so I assume

1661
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
this band gap

1662
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
is 3.2eV

1663
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
or

1664
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I don't know

1665
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
let's say 3eV

1666
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
assume

1667
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
a photon above 3eV

1668
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
comes in

1669
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
you can

1670
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
split carrier hole

1671
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
electron hole pair

1672
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
ok

1673
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
so you assume

1674
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
electron hole pair is split

1675
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and start

1676
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
simulation

1677
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
ok, got it

1678
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
any questions?

1679
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
if not

1680
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
let's thank

1681
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Guan Zhong

1682
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
thank you

1683
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
thank you

1684
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I'll turn off the recording
