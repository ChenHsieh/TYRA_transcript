00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. I'm very happy to be here for the fifth session of the Project TARA summer series.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Today's event is a scientific drawing sharing by Professor Liu Junlin.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
I'll quickly introduce Professor Liu's background.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Professor Liu is currently studying electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
He is currently working as an assistant professor.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
In 2010, he obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Later, he obtained a master's degree in telecommunications.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
In 2018, he obtained a doctorate in Caltech.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
His research interests include Sparse Error Signal Processing and Statistical Signal Processing.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Today, Professor Liu will share with us his experience in latex.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
On behalf of the audience, I welcome Professor Liu's speech.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Now, I'll give Professor Liu the floor. Thank you.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you very much for the introduction.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Did you hear my voice?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay, thank you.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Thank you for the invitation to Project TARA.

01:32.000 --> 01:42.000
It's an honor for me to share my experience in latex.

01:43.000 --> 01:59.000
In my presentation, I will introduce my experience in latex and some basic ideas.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
If you have any questions or ideas during the presentation, please feel free to ask.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Now, let's move on to today's presentation.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Today is the fifth session of our summer special event.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
We will talk about scientific drawing.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
We will mainly use the latex tool.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Before we start, I would like to ask the audience,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Have you ever heard of the term latex?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Can you raise your hand or make a sound?

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I see some of the audience in the chat have heard of it.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
For those who have heard of it, they may think that latex is a tool for writing papers.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Why put it under the theme of scientific drawing?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
This is what I want to share with you today.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Latex actually has some relative tools that can be used for scientific drawing.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I also have some relative experience.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Let's continue our presentation.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
First of all, I will do a simple introduction.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Then I will take some time to introduce latex.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
If some of the audience has not heard of it or is not familiar with some of the details,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
I will take some time to introduce what latex is to the audience.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
The third part is that I will specifically mention a term called PGFTIKZ.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
It can be a good combination with latex.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I will also mention some related examples.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Finally, I will explain some related resources to you.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
If you are interested, you can use it as a reference.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Today's topic is scientific drawing.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
I believe that most of the audience is academic background.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So in the academic background,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
you often need to do an academic expression.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
What is academic expression?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
You may need to write a paper.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Or you need to write a verbal report.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Today's occasion is more like a verbal report.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
In some occasions, you will need to make a poster report.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
These are some media that are academic in expressing some concepts or more complex ideas.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
It may be in the form of an article, a video, or a poster.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
In these forms,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
this chart is actually a very efficient way of communication.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
You can imagine that

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
when you have a more complex concept that needs to be explained,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
if you use a lot of very long sentences to explain

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and draw a simple chart,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
everyone can see it clearly.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
Usually, most readers prefer to use charts

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
to make a conceptual expression.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
So if you want to add some charts to your post,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
the next question is

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
which interface to use to generate this chart?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I believe I mentioned two weeks ago that

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
you can use Illustrator to draw some pretty charts.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The theme of this week is

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I want to use the Latex language interface.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
It actually has some corresponding kits and tools

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
to create some nice charts.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Let me quickly use a sentence to explain what Latex is.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It's actually a layout system.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
What this layout system does is

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
a lot of text files

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
after a series of compilation processes

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
are laid out into the file files you see.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
So in fact, like the video I reported today,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I also did it with Latex.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
In fact, there are a lot of

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
text compilations behind it.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
These text compilations will tell us

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
what words are in this page,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
what color are these words,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
what are the order of these items,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
and so on.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
It will compile such a file.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Latex is a layout software.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
It can compile a file based on such compilations

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
to look like the one you see in the video.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Let's quickly talk about PGF and TIKZ.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
PGF is actually called

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Portable Graphics Format.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
In fact, what everyone is familiar with

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
is the language of TIKZ.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
It's actually a Latex kit.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
This kit is for drawing some charts,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
especially when you use a compilation method

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
to describe a chart.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
There are some particularly useful methods.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
In the remaining time,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I will also mention one called PGF Plots.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It is also a Latex kit.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
It can draw some common charts.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
After using it myself,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I feel like I want to share it with you.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So today I will focus on

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
introducing these tools

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
and some of my personal experience.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
This is a general idea

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
that we will go through today.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Next, I will show you a chart.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Let me tell you about this chart first.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
This chart is a chart I took

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
from my class video.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
I want to use this chart to give you an example.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
First of all, when you look at this chart,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
you see a lot of words,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
a lot of shapes, a lot of colors.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Here is an example of this chart.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
In fact, to describe this chart,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
it can be divided into several steps.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
One step is the words marked above.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
For example, you see a lot of words up here.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Then there are some relative numerals.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
There are also some relative words and numerals below.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
So if you want to express a concept clearly,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
there may be some relative numbers of words above.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
In this chart,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
you can also see some relative shapes.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
For example, you can see a lot of squares here.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Then there are a lot of regular squares lined up.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Of course, the focus of today's speech

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
is not to introduce these details.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
I mainly use this chart to give you an example.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
To produce this chart,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
you need to have some descriptions of the shapes.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Then you may need to do something like

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
drawing a line to produce this chart.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So you can see that there are

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
all kinds of lines between different squares.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
There are green lines, there are orange lines,

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
and there may be some relatively small words marked above.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
So usually on this kind of expression,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
there may be some colors

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
or some relative text styles.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
These may be some points that you can focus on

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
when designing the chart.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
You may see this chart and think

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
that it seems to contain a lot of details.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Let me explain to you first.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
This is actually one of the pages of the last video.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
The complete version actually has a relative animation.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That is to say, different colors,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
different labels will gradually appear.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
But here is just to give you a demonstration and reference.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
If you have any questions during the listening process,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
you are very welcome to make a question.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Then we can have a discussion at the moment.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
If you don't have any questions,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
let me introduce the tools now.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
My takeaway today is that

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I hope you will have some ideas

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
about how to produce this kind of chart

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
after listening to it.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Of course, how to produce it in detail

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
will be related to the instructions for this chart.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
But I hope to inspire you to say

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
that if you want to produce this kind of chart,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
how to do it with Latex?

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
First, let me introduce this Latex.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Latex, as I just mentioned,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
is a layout software.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
In fact, it is not a single software.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
It has a relatively advanced layout system.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I listed a few here.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
For example, if you have more research

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
on the details of this kind of Latex,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
it is actually divided into a Plantex.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
It is the most primitive version.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Later, someone based on this Plantex

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
to make some improvements,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
such as improving Latex or PDF Latex

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
or some extension versions

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
that can be compiled into Chinese.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
But these are all relative technical details.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
It actually has a relative development history.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I think today's topic is more scientific.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So I probably won't do

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
a detailed analysis of these items.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
What you hear is to get a concept first.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It's basically a...

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
If you have some writing experience,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
you can think of it as

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
something like a compiler.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It stores some text information

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
and then does some interpretation and analysis

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
according to these text contents,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
and then produces a relative file.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
When you look at the paper,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
in fact, a more common file format

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
should be a PDF format.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
So this Latex,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
it's a relatively common design,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
that is, the step of producing a file is

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
that the user actually compiles a text file.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
The alias of this text file is .tex.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And then after some proper compilation,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
it can produce a PDF file.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
This PDF is a bit like the PDF files

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
you see when you read the paper.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
So this is a basic process of Latex.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
In fact, if you are not familiar with

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
this process,

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
if you have used Word

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
to write documents,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
this Word file basically means

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
that you have a full window screen.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
In this window screen,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
suppose you have a full window screen,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
you can do something under this screen,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
such as inputting text and inserting a picture,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
or doing some editing.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
This kind of compiler is more like

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
you can see the file at the moment of editing.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
What does it look like?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
This Latex is another kind.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It's a little bit more indirect.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
When you are operating,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
it's actually editing a text file.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
The text file is just describing

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
what the final document should look like

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
in a narrative language.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So when you are editing a text file,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
you have to use a little bit of your imagination,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that is, you give this command,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
and then it might look like

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
This PDF is the last file you see.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
So this editing aspect

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
may not be the same as

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
the Word you often use.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Let's continue.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Next, I'm going to make an example.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
If you haven't touched Latex,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I'll give you a simple example.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Is this word too small?

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
The left side is TEX file.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
After proper compilation,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
a PDF file will be created.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
If you think the picture is too small,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
you can tell me,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
and I can make some adjustments here.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Basically, a common TEX file

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
has a standard way to do it.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This standard way is like this.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
That is, when you are narrating this file,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
you have to explain

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
what kind of thing you produce.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Is it an article?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Or, for example,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
there are some commands that can be generated,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
such as a video.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It will need to define

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
what kind of thing I produce.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It has a command here called

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
draw a diagonal line, then document class,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
followed by the type of file you want to produce.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's very similar to writing,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
that is,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
in the process of editing,

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
you need to insert some packages appropriately.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
These packages can tell you

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
what commands you can use next.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
What commands are defined next?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Let me mention this a little bit.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
The first package is a generation.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
It will be used in the 16th line.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
It is a command to generate a test text.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
The command in the 5th line

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
is a relatively

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
if you want to input some mathematical equations,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
some commands will be defined

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
in this AMS Math environment.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
So, after the 18th line,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
there are some mathematical equations.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
So, in order to use these commands,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
we need to introduce some relative packages.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Another one is that there is some information,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
like this one.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I just mentioned that it is an article.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So, typical articles may need

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
a title information,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
then the author's information,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and the date and time information.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
It may need to be explained

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
with some relevant commands.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
After setting up these environments,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
the 10th line below

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
describes the content of your file.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
So, like the 13th line,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
it is a title of a file.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
So, after entering this command,

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
the three parts on the right PDF will be generated,

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
that is, the title, the author's name and time.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
The part of the 16th line

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
will generate some test text.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
So, this is the part of the 16th line test text

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
in this place.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
After the 19th line,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
some mathematical formulas are generated.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
These mathematical formulas are

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
under this text.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
So, in practice,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
the advantage is that

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
you can focus on

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
what you want to write.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
For example, you focus on

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
the content you want to write,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and then the relative arrangement,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
or the font,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
or these words,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
the mathematical formula,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
the relative position.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
This arrangement system

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
has a set of methods

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
to arrange these relative positions.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So, when you write this text,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
you just need to focus on

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
the content of the text.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
So, this is an example

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
to show you this LaTeX.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Let me explain to you

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
some of the corresponding tools of LaTeX.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I believe that

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
LaTeX has a lot of choices.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I mainly divide it into three categories.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
One is called the editor.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
It is mainly used to edit this text file.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
The other is the layout system.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Then, the PDF file you produce

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
will also need some software

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
to look at the content of this PDF file.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So, if you want to set up

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
these environments on your computer,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
you may need some relative...

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
For example, set up an editor,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
a layout system,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
and then choose a PDF viewer.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
There are actually quite a few editors on the market.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
There are some editors

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
specifically designed for LaTeX,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
such as these below,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
or some more common editors

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
that can only edit pure text,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
such as these.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Because of time constraints,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I won't mention all of them.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
After you have edited these text files,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I just mentioned that

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
you still need some editing systems.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
These three are more common on the market.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
These three can actually be downloaded for free

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
and installed on your computer.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
They have some relative

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
system environment settings.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Because of time constraints,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
I won't mention these environment settings.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
After you have successfully edited,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
there will be some relative

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
PDF file viewers.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Let me show you an example.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
If I choose from here,

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
let's say I choose Visual Studio Code.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If you are writing code,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
you may have heard of this editor.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Then use TextLive.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
This computer has already installed TextLive.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Then there may be a PDF viewer at the end.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So I'll open a demo here.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Just this file.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
This file is the same.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
This is actually the same as a writer.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
There will be some relative editing functions behind it.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Then this one just happens to be able to

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
go straight to this relative PDF function.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
So if you want to edit,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
let's say you want to add more things here.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Just add it directly.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
If you edit,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
it will be right here.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
After editing,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
the PDF file will be updated.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
If you haven't used LaTeX,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
it's actually a...

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
I feel like it's pretty close to writing.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
It's just that the final result is a PDF file.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
The above is mainly a basic introduction to LaTeX.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You may be curious.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
So there are so many file editing tools.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So why do we have to use LaTeX?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Then I'm here to quickly mention

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
some of the features or advantages of LaTeX.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
One of the features is that

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
it deals with this kind of mathematical problem.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Assuming that your report or paper

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
requires a lot of mathematical problems.

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
In fact, it has some advantages in using LaTeX.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
For example,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
like you want to enter the lower right corner of this

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
these mathematical formulas.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
What about these mathematical formulas?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
You can see that it's actually...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I'll give you an example here.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
It may be related to some symbols of some triangular functions.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
If you want to enter this content,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
under LaTeX,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
it actually opens a relative mathematical environment.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Then like these functions,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
these sine, zeta,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
or something like the denominator.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
It will have some corresponding mathematical symbols.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
For example, there are some sine, zeta,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
or if you want to enter the denominator.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
The denominator has some relative environments that can be entered.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Here's a strange symbol.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
It actually has some relative symbols

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
that can be entered.

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
If your file has a lot of mathematical problems,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
for example, there are very long mathematical inferences,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
formula proofs, and so on.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Editing in text format

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
is actually easier to maintain.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Because when you look at the text,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
you can just look at this symbol

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
and know what this symbol is.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
And save these symbols

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
and translate them into our beautiful mathematical form.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Another thing I would like to mention by the way is

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
that LaTeX also has a feature

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
that is when you have a lot of things

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
that need to be interacted with and used.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
For example,

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
in some related papers that may need a lot of mathematical terms,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
sometimes it may use numbers to represent some equations.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Put it in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Under the progress of the article,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
we may need to say

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
which mathematical formula we use to push something.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So in the article,

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
we need to repeatedly mention some mathematical numbers.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
LaTeX actually has some pretty good features.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
You can use the interaction query command.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
You can set up a label.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
In the article,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
when you want to quote this label,

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
you can use it as a variable.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Okay, let me tell you quickly

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
that this is a feature of LaTeX.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It has a very powerful function

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
in dealing with mathematical numbers.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay, another one is my personal experience.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
It is a feature of LaTeX.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Its feature is that

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
when you are dealing with a very long file,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
it has a special advantage.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
What is a very long file?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
For example,

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
if you want to write a master's thesis or a doctor's thesis,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
at this time,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
the number of pages may reach a lot of pages.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Or for example,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
if you want to...

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
For example,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
some textbooks you see on the market.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Textbooks may have hundreds or thousands of pages.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
At this time,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
you can try to think about

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
how to maintain these hundreds or thousands of pages.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
In fact, LaTeX has a feature that I personally quite like.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
That is,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
it can split the content of the file

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
into different files to write.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
So here's an example.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Suppose you have a file named man.tex now.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
This can be seen as a main file.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
This main file will describe that

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
there are two parts in this article.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
One is introduction,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and the other is results.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
That's the end of the description.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
By the way,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
this input file is...

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
The input command can be seen as

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
the content of this file is arranged.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
You can do an understanding like this first.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
So when LaTeX meets here,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
it will grab the corresponding file.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
So at this time,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
when you write the introduction,

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
you just have to focus on the narrative of the introduction.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
So this file is

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
specifically talking about the content of the introduction.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
You can see that it has some test text.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
Then there is a line of test text here.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
This introduction,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I actually have a command here,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
which is section.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
It is actually one of the sections of this article.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Then the section is followed by the title of this section.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
So if you want to focus on writing the introduction,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
just open this file and focus on writing it.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
If you want to write another section,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
such as results,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
just focus on opening this file

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
and focus on editing here.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So writing these files separately

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
is actually easier for you to maintain longer files.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
There is another one that I personally think

28:10.000 --> 28:17.000
LaTeX is a powerful function.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
That is, if you are good at using the input command,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
you can think of it as

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
the input is to grab a file from the outside

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and paste it over.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
So in fact, if you have some experimental data,

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
let's assume that these data are stored in text.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Suppose you use the program to calculate a number.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Suppose the number is 1, 2, 3.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Then you can store this number in a text file.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
When you are editing the file,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you can insert the number content of this text file

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
in the right place.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
You may ask,

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
why don't I just type 1, 2, 3 here?

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
The resulting file result is the same.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
But from the perspective of maintenance,

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I personally prefer to separate the file content

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
from the experimental data

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
to make a separate file.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Suppose you run different experiments later

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and the data needs to be updated.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
You just need to update this file.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
You don't need to jump back to the result section

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
to change this number.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Especially if this number is used a lot.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
This has appeared in many articles.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
If you change one of the two,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
and you forget to change one,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
you may be challenged by the reviewer at this time.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
So what do you show?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
If you want to maintain a larger file

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
from a longer perspective,

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
these files may need to be changed and updated.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
I personally think this kind of separate file is quite recommended.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
I mentioned two features of LaTeX here.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Then I will talk about a Graphics

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
which is included in today's topic.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
Use LaTeX to add some elements of scientific drawing.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
If you search for LaTeX on the Internet,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
most of the files will tell you

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
that there is an instruction called Include Graphics.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
This instruction tells us that

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
this instruction needs a package called GraphicsX

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
to be used.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Simply put,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
it will extract the file from your computer.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
For example, there is a JPEG file at this time.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
This JPEG file will be extracted

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
and placed in the proper place in your PDF file.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
So I have an example here.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
So he grabbed two pictures.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
One is JPEG and the other is PNG.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
He grabbed these two pictures to make a layout.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
In fact, the left one is JPEG,

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
and the right one is PNG.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
So now you have two pictures.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Because of time constraints,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
I may not be able to explain each instruction.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
If you have any questions later,

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
you are welcome to ask.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
So this is basically an instruction

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
to insert two pictures.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
When you draw a picture,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
you need to pay attention to

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
that the picture is divided into Raster Scan.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
You take a picture.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Suppose you have a picture on your hand.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Raster Graphics is a bit like

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
it takes a lot of different pixels in this picture

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
and records the color of each pixel.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
So, for example, JPEG or PNG,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
it basically stores the data behind

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
what the information of each pixel is.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Of course, it does some image processing

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
and some other processing.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
But its basic spirit is

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
to store the contents of different colors.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But this kind of storage method

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
will have a disadvantage.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
That is,

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
suppose you put this picture very large.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
I may not be able to see it clearly here.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
If you have JPEG or PNG on your hand,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
you can try to put these pictures.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
If you can't,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
you can, for example,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
zoom in on a place.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Keep zooming in, zooming in, zooming in.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
At the end of the zoom,

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
you will see some blurry images on the edge.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
The text may also become more blurry

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
and may not be able to be read.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
In terms of academic documents,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
this is actually a bad thing.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Because it may affect

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
our understanding of a concept

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
or judgment.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
In fact, in academic documents,

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
it is more preferable to use

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
so-called vector graphics.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
That is, when you are storing a picture,

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
you should actually use the so-called pixel picture.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
When you describe these documents,

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
you should use,

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
now there is a picture.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
What is its length and width?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
Where is its location?

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
The coordinates of these points in it.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Or these lines,

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
are they round, square,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
straight, or triangle?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Use these methods to describe a picture.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Academic documents are actually

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
more preferable to do this.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
The commonly used vector graphics

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
is actually called an EPS file.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
It is a commonly used vector graphics

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
file format.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
So here you might think,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
so if I use LaTeX,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
I will just,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
like the files generated by your program,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
I will just save it as an EPS file

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
and insert it into it.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Theoretically, you can do this.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
But have you ever thought about

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
some situations?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I will give you an example here.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
These situations are actually

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
encountered in writing paper.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Suppose there are two pictures now,

34:43.000 --> 34:49.000
the picture on the left and the picture on the right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I will give you an example.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Suppose you want to present

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
a picture like this.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Then there may be a curve here,

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
and another curve here.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Then there may be some

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
corresponding legend,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
that is,

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
what is number one and what is number two?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Number one may be one of the lines,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
and number two may be one of the lines.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Have you ever encountered a situation

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
that when you print these pictures,

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
some parts of the picture,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
such as some corresponding labels here,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
it happens to be related to

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
some square numbers in your paper.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Suppose one of the curves

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
is generated by your source code number 1,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and the other one may be generated

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
by the source code number 3.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Suppose you need to encounter

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
a picture like this.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
What about a picture like this?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
If you first save it

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
to the EPS file in the city,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
this number 1 and number 3

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
are actually already written in this file.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
At that time, if you are editing the paper,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
when this number 1 and number 3 change,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
your picture will not do the corresponding update.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
So this is actually a situation

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
that I had encountered when I was writing paper.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
Then I tried to figure out

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
if there was a more systematic way

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
to deal with this problem.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
This is what I'm going to talk about later,

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
a method of pgftikz.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
It's my personal experience.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Do you have any questions here?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
If you have any questions,

36:35.000 --> 36:44.000
you can ask me by voice.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
If not,

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
let me talk about the tool pgftikz.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
First of all, when we talk about this tool,

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
let's go back to the picture thing.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
In the field that is more related to me,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
the pictures that are usually involved

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
are probably these two types.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
One is called a system architecture picture.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
It will describe

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
how your information is processed.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
For example, you have done some add-ons,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
do some processing of different systems,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
and then put some relative information

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
to make some different connections.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
The following picture is in my field of research,

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
which is a relatively common picture.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
This is called a system architecture picture.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
When you look at this picture,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
it's actually quite simple.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
It is mainly composed of several elements,

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
which are text, some lines,

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
and some different squares,

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
such as a rectangle or a circle.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
It's probably just these elements.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
It's not very complicated to describe.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
So how to effectively produce this kind of relative picture

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
is actually a very interesting topic.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
This is a system diagram.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
The other one is the one I just mentioned,

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
which is a diagram.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
For example, the one on my right is also a diagram.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Let's say it has two curves.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
These two curves may have their own

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
horizontal and vertical axes,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
and then there will be relative information points.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm just drawing a diagram here.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
These information points may be represented

38:29.000 --> 38:35.000
by a circle and a rectangle.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
These two pictures

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
can actually be used with Lattice,

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
which is Lattice coupled with TIKZ or PGF plots,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
which is a relative command,

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
to produce two such pictures directly in Lattice.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So next I'm going to explain to you

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
that if you want to produce these pictures,

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
you may need some relevant content.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Okay, let me show you the program.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
TIKZ is mainly like this.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
You can imagine it as a language

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
that describes the shape of the picture.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
This language, as I just mentioned,

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
is a picture of a quantity.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
So if you recall some of the concepts

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
of quantity that you may have learned before,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
to describe a quantity,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
it may be to describe its starting point and ending point,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
and then connect them together.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Then I know how to describe different shapes.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
This is to describe this triangle,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
which is to mark the end point.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Or if it's a circle,

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
it may be to describe its circumference and radius.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
So it's actually a combination of

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
describing the shape you produce.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
So here's an example.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
For example, if you want to draw a line,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
its relative command is actually quite direct.

40:01.000 --> 40:08.000
You just need to determine the relative coordinates.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
The relative command is that you draw a straight line

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
and then draw it from the coordinate point 00

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
to the coordinate point 10.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
So when you run the fourth line,

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
it will produce this line.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
From 00 to 10,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
it draws this line.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
There are also some commands that say

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
you can decorate this line.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
For example, you can draw a arrow.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Its relative command is that

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
you draw a shape like an arrow.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Draw a line and then a triangle.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
The shape of this arrow starts from 00.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You can think of it as drawing an arrow

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
from 00 to 01.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
So it's the arrow above.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
So it's actually a pretty intuitive description language

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
to describe some geometric shapes.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
For example, if you want to draw a triangle,

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
it's actually the relative coordinate point.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's actually this point.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
This point is our 11 coordinate point.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Then this point is 22.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Then this is 2.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
So you draw these lines

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and connect them.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
There are some additional commands.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
For example, you can adjust the thickness of the line,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
adjust the format of the line,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
or adjust the color of the line.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
This is a demo for you.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
Of course, it can draw something like a circle.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
This means that the center of the circle is 1-1.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
The center of the circle is 1-1,

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
and the radius is 0.5.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
So it draws this.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
You can also draw something relative.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
For example, it draws a rectangle.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
This rectangle,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
its command is

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
to draw from one corner of this rectangle

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
to another corner.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
So the upper left corner is 3-1,

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
and the lower right corner is 4-2.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
So it's actually

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
as long as you determine the coordinate system,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
and then determine some coordinate numbers,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
it actually has some pretty intuitive language

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
to draw these pictures.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
So this is basically the function of TIKZ drawing.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You can actually go back to

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
suppose you need to draw a picture.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
If it's something like

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
some of the architecture pictures mentioned earlier,

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
it's actually nothing more than some lines, shapes,

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
and some combinations of text blocks.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
So if you want to draw a text block,

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
it can use a command called node.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
This node command,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
you can think of it as

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
insert a text block,

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
and then insert it in which position.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
For example, the command 22 is

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
inserted in 00.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Insert a text block in 00.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
Then its text content is 00.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
One thing that's special is that

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
in this place,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
it's actually

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
the place where I marked in green,

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
it's actually in harmony with the lattice.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Simply put,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
the grammar you can use in the lattice,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
including the mathematical formula you use,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
or the formula you want to quote,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
or the reference number you want to quote,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
can all be written directly here.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Then when the lattice is compiled,

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
it will automatically update this part.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Because of the time factor,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I may not go into detail about these commands.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Basically, you can create some text blocks.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Then I will tell you another concept.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
What I personally like about TIK is that

44:23.000 --> 44:30.000
it can make a very precise description of your chart.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
What's the reason?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
The reason is that it uses some

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
coordinate numbers behind it

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
to describe the shape of the chart.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
So for example,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
let's say I draw this picture on the right.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
This picture on the right,

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
I have listed the corresponding commands.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Basically, it is inserted into a text block.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
What I want to do is to insert a text block.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Then its content is this text box.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Then some corresponding styles.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Then its location is 0, 0 in the coordinate system.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Then a more special thing is that

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
you can take a name for this text block.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
Take a name like this with a small quotation mark.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Then when you draw something else,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
you can compare this name,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
the name of the text box,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
to describe its different locations.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
For example, it's like 6 to 8 here.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
It can target the north-west of the text box,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
this top left point.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
Draw a circle at this point on the left of the text box.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
Then the radius of this circle is 0.05.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
So you get this circle.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
It is very accurately pasted on the top left corner of this text box.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
You can draw it like the north side

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
or other places like this.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
So you can draw these corresponding locations.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
These locations can also be called anchor points.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
That is, when you connect the lines,

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
you can directly force the specified line to connect to this point,

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
or this point, this point.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
So this is the one for TIKZ.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
Then I will explain a little bit about

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
some of my personal experience

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
and some of the experience of drawing this system architecture.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
One of my personal favorites is that

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
it is actually quite compatible with Lattice.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
For example, you are in this place of this text,

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
it is actually the direct input of the corresponding Lattice command.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So when you have a square number,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
or some numbers,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
or some special mathematical characters,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
for example,

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
like you need a special character in this picture,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
it can be presented perfectly.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Another one is the relative size.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
These sizes are actually all described in numbers,

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
so it can describe the relative position very accurately.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
So these two text boxes are actually the same size.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
That is, the size of this square and this square is the same.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
And they are actually completely aligned.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
If you put the picture carefully,

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
you can see that the left half and the right half are curved,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
and they are precisely aligned.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Why is that?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
In fact, when you are writing,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
you have already described this thing accurately.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So the picture he made

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
can be very precise in size and position.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Another one is that

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
I think this kind of picture is easier to maintain.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Simply put,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
because there are these text boxes behind it,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
so if you want to maintain it,

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
if you want to make all the circles bigger in this text box,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I don't want to use 0.05,

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
I want to make all these circles bigger.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
In fact, it is to make some search replacements in the text box,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
and replace all these 0.05.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Another one is my personal opinion.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Because it is a text box,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
so if you have some software

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
that allows you to control the interface,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and if you have experience in using it,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
it can be used in a way like git

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
to maintain your file or image,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
how to make changes.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
So this is what I think about drawing some pictures with TIKZ.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Next, let's talk about some plots.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
This plot,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
you can look at it as

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
some of the pictures we just drew in some experiments.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Some of the pictures presented in some experiments,

48:53.000 --> 49:01.000
and then there may be some horizontal and vertical descriptions.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
To produce this picture,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
you can think about

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
what you actually did

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
when you produced this picture.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
In fact, it doesn't matter,

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
you probably did three things.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
The first thing is that

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
you worked very hard to do some experiments,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
write some cities,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
produce some experimental data,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
or collect some experimental data.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
So this should be a stage for you to do research,

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
which is to produce some experimental data.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
The other stage is that

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
according to your experimental data,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
you want to produce some more beautiful pictures,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
and then maybe clearer,

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
some pictures that are more visible,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
so this may be the second stage.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
The third stage is that

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
when you produce the picture,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
you need to present it in,

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
for example, your paper,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
or your video,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
or on your poster.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
So there may be these three stages.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
The stage that people use more often

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
may be that

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
they tend to use the same software

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
for stage 1 and stage 2.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
For example,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
what I use more often is MATLAB.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
You can do some calculations in MATLAB,

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
and then it has some functions that can produce pictures.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
After the picture, you can save it like this,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
and then save it,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
and then paste it on,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
for example, your paper or slides.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
This is a method.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
If you have some other languages,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
such as Python or R,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
or GNU Plot,

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
it actually has a lot of different choices.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
This is a method.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
It's a more common method.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
Here, I'd like to ask you a few situations.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
These situations are actually

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
what you encounter when you do research.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
If you encounter the following three situations,

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
the above methods may become a little bit

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
more cumbersome.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
The first situation is that

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
if you have produced your picture,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
and you have shown it to other people,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
to your partner or advisor,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
he thinks this picture

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
may need to add one more curve,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
or compare it in one more way,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
or add some more data points.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
If you use a method like MATLAB,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
you may have to go back to the original city,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and run the city again.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
But think about it,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
this seems to be a little bit,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
some places are repeated.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
In fact, in this picture,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
there are some curves and some data

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
that you have dealt with before.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
So you don't need to deal with it again.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
What you need to do

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
is to deal with

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
what you haven't done yet.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
So, is there anything

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
that can separate this thing?

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
It's like the first thing,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
produce data and draw a picture.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Can these two things be handled separately?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
When you have a new experiment,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
you should focus on

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
producing new data.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Drawing a picture,

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
you should have a common interface

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
to update the picture.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Another situation is that

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
maybe when you are writing a paper,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
suppose you change the mathematical symbol.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
In the process of changing the paper,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
maybe there are some mathematical symbols

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Then you may change it to B.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
It becomes that in this article,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
everything with the symbol A

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
has to be changed to the symbol B.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
If unfortunately,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
this symbol B appears in one of the small places

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
in your picture,

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
then you have to go back and open the method

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
and manually change the place of A to B.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
When there are a lot of things,

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
this thing is actually a little bit,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
it's a little bit cumbersome.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Then there is another one,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
which is the relative mathematical symbol.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
If you have some drawing experience,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
the picture produced by MATLAB,

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
the text below it is actually a certain symbol.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
But if you use LaTeX to write a paper,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
the shape of the symbol required by the paper

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
is actually sometimes another one.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
It may not be the same as the MATLAB symbol.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
So is there a way to say

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
that all the symbols are unified?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
In addition,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
if there is a mathematical shape here,

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
suppose some more special mathematical symbols,

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
can they appear in this picture

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
with the same shape?

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
In fact, I encountered some relative situations

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
in the drawing before.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
After a little research,

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
I think I personally

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
use this method of PGF plot.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
It is actually a drawing tool,

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
and it is based on TIKZ as a drawing function.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
It is compatible with LaTeX.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It is a new drawing tool,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
but its spirit of drawing

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
is actually similar to most drawing software.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
You will need to produce relative labels,

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
legend, or some different line format.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
This part of the spirit is close.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Because of time constraints,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I may quickly mention that

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
although this is a new tool,

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
but there are some ready-made conversion tools.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Suppose the picture produced by MATLAB

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
can have some converters

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
that can be converted to TIKZ language.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
This is what I found when I was making the video,

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
that is, some pictures produced by Python

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
also have some related packages

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
that can be converted to the language of TIKZ.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
Another experience I would like to mention is

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
that suppose you need to update your data.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
As mentioned earlier,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
suppose you have three experimental pictures,

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
and you may be asked to add another curve.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
At this time,

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
you don't need to create a new picture.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
My own approach is

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
that you should maintain a text file.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
This text file describes the data

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
of the relative data points in the green one.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
There may be a blue text file

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
that describes the numbers on the blue lines,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
the numbers on these pictures.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
At that time,

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
the pgfplot can directly use the input file method

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
to update these pictures at the same time.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I want to use the time later

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
to quickly tell you what its philosophy is.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
If you are interested in these instructions,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
we can discuss it later.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
This is a pgfplot spirit.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
You can notice that it is actually

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
compatible with the latest.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
It is actually wrapped in the environment of TIKZ.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
What it does is

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
there is an environment called begin and end access.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
In this environment,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
you will need to have a range to explain

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
some of the coordinates,

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
such as its width, its x-level,

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
what is the value, and then what is the y-level value.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Notice that this place

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
you can put the latest definition.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
So you can make sure that its font is the same.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
So if you look closely at this picture,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
the font of this place

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
is the same as the font of my first video.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
So if you update it like this,

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
it will automatically process these two

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
with the same font.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
The addplot is a bit like

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
you have a curve, so it will produce

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
a curve of data1 here

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
and a curve of data2.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Here it is another

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
from an external text file.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
This is an external text file.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
It will define all the numbers

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
of these data points.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Grab these data

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
and paste it into this picture.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
I want to tell you quickly.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Finally, let me tell you

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
what I think of Latex.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
If you are new to Latex,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
DIKZ, PJ Plot,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
maybe you have never touched it

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
or maybe you don't have much experience,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
I personally recommend Overleaf.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Overleaf is a platform

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
where you can write Latex online.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Basically,

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
some of the layout settings

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
have been set for you.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
So it will be easier to write.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I will list some

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
relative reference resources later.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
If you use Overleaf,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
it actually has some

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
related instructions

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and some documents

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
that you can learn Latex

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
in 30 minutes.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
I also found some

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
if you want to do

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
a more detailed reference,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
there are some like Wikibook

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
for reference.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
If you are interested

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
in this kind of drawing,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
there is a PGF manual.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
You can click on it.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
It has a pretty detailed

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
document

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
like this.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Let me show you.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
It has a document

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
for DIKZ, PJ Plot

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
with more than 1,000 pages.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
In fact, many of my instructions

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
are found from it.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
The concept is also

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
taken from it.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Some websites,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
like this website,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I think it's pretty good.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
It has some examples of

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
drawing with PJ Plot.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So if you go in and have a look,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
there are some pretty

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
maps.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
It also lists the relevant instructions.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
You can have a look.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Another one is that

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
there are also some online discussions on the Internet.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
If you have any questions about this kind of text,

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
you can post it on it.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
What's next?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
I mainly list some

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
editors I mentioned earlier.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
There are some relative websites

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
with relative editors.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Basically,

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
these editors should all be

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
downloaded from the website

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
and installed.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
It's also like

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
if you want to set up

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
this editor environment

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
on your own computer,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
there are actually several more common ones.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
I also list the relevant information.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
If you are interested in

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
this kind of map conversion, DIKZ,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I also list the relevant

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
websites here.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You can use it as a reference.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Okay, I think it's about time.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Finally, thank you for listening.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I hope you can

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
use LaTeX

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
in your research

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and successfully express

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the results you want to express.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Okay, I think

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
we'll stop here.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Thank you, Mr. Liu, for your wonderful sharing.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I just saw

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
in the chat

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
a few questions.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
If you have any questions,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
you're welcome to

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
open the microphone

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
and ask your question.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Or if your microphone is not convenient,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I can quickly go through

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
the comments.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
There are a few comments

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I saw,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
for example, Yan

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
wants to know

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
how similar

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
LaTeX and HTML are.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Do you recommend using

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
text editor software?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Okay, thank you very much

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
for Yan's question.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I'll start with

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
the degree of similarity between

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
the two languages.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Here is a

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
user interface

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
for your reference.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
In fact, if you

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
have a little research

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
on HTML,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
HTML seems to

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
have something

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
at the beginning of a label

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and something

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
at the end.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
In LaTeX,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
it's more like

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
using a line

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and then a command,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and then put this thing

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
inside with this big quotation mark.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I feel

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
that its spirit is close.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
For example,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
if the thing you put in the back

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
is more complicated,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
it will use some

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
begin-end environment

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
to wrap

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
the things here.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I think the spirit is

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
quite similar to

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
HTML.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
also close to what I mentioned earlier.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Its spirit is a bit like

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
writing

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
mathematics

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
or

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
a layout for

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
academic articles.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It may have more functions.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Let's see

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
the next one.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
LaTeX.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Use

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
the source code

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
control software

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
to pursue

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
the editing problem.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Thank you.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I seem to have forgotten to answer a question.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Do you recommend using

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
text editor software

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
to understand text grammar?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I didn't seem to answer this one.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I can go back to

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
the previous one.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
In my opinion,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
as long as it's easy to use.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
In fact,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
these can be recognized.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The red ones

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
should be able to recognize text grammar.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Then

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the right ones

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
may need to install some special

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
kits.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
The last one is a

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
notebook in Windows.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So it may

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
not be able to have other kits.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
The first few editors

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
actually have corresponding kits.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I can

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
demo it for you.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I use Visual Studio Code here.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Then it has a

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
package called

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
LaTeX Workshop.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It actually

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
writes a little bit like

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
what you see here with

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:40.000
relative

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
conforming

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
instructions.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Good.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I don't know if I can turn on the setting.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Well,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I usually

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
change it directly.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Well,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
if you are interested,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
you can actually study it a little bit,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
that is,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I usually

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
change it directly.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Well,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
if you are interested,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
you can actually study it a little bit,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
that is,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
you can actually study it a little bit,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
that is,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Visual Studio Code with

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Latest Workshop.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
In fact,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
this kit will help you

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
set things up.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So when you type directly,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
you can begin,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and then it will be generated directly.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
although it is a text editor,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
it is suitable for

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
when you want to use it,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
sometimes

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it seems that

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
some environments can be selected.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Well,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I believe that

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
these I marked can actually

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
do similar functions.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If it is on the left,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
it should be preset,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and there are some relatively

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
grammatical instructions.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Then I go back to

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
the third question.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Well,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
if you need more people to edit a document,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that is,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
directly using the source code control software to track

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
or there is a test dedicated maintenance platform.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Well,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
if you want to be

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
simple and easy to use,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
that is, you don't need to do any settings,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I personally recommend Overleaf.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
It is that you

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
open an account in Overleaf,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
you can open a project

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
under this account,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and then you can share it with others.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
If other people are editing,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
in fact,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I remember that there are some on the right,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
you can do some discussions,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
you can do some comments.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So personally, I think Overleaf

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
is actually a relatively

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
friendly interface

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
for beginners.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Well,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
if you use the source code control software

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
to edit documents,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
that's fine.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
If you have,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I just mentioned Git,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
it should be mentioned in Overleaf.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Here I mentioned Git,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
that is, it is actually a version control software.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
You can imagine it

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
as controlling

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
a group of text files,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
which changes it made.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
If you do

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
the right maintenance,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
these changes can be

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
shared between multiple users.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I am using

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Git,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
but after I write a paragraph,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I will commit it to

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Git,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that is, I am now drawing to this extent,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and then save it first.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
If there are more users,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I believe that Git

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
can also do it.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The dedicated maintenance platform

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
may be Overleaf.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So it is more like

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
it depends on

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
which interface

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
users like to use.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I don't know if I have answered

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Ian's question.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
At this stage,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I would like to

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
stop the recording.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
If you still have time

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and have questions,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
you are welcome to

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
discuss freely.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Thank you for your sharing.
