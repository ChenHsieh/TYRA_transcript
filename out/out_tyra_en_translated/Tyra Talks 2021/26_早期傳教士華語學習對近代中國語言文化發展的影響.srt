1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, thank you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thank you, everyone.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'd like to share my screen with you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the topic I'm going to talk about today.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The influence of early Western missionary Chinese education on modern Chinese language and culture.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First of all, this is a very new topic.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In fact, it is my experience of studying the history of Chinese education in the past few years.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because it is the first time to publish, there may be some lack of evidence or some points of view are not mature enough.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I'd like to ask you to give me some feedback later.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or you are welcome to contact me after the meeting.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So thank you, everyone.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In addition, I would like to thank my instructor.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Because the idea of ​​this topic is probably related to his leadership.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That is, Professor Xin Shichuang.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is also my Chinese teacher, the instructor of the course, Mr. Gu Baili.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This whole topic and some of the content is also the result of the cooperation between this teacher and the teacher.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, so let's get into my structure first.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The topic of my report today is roughly divided into three parts.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The first is the preface.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The second is the main part.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Discuss how missionary Chinese education affects the influence of this country's language and culture.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will discuss it at about 6 o'clock.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The third part is the conclusion.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
At the beginning of this part, I would like to explain to you first.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the influence of missionary Chinese education on China.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But this topic focuses on the ideas developed by the missionary to learn Chinese.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Or his learning process.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Or some of his teaching materials.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do these things affect modern China?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on science.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on painting and architecture.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We will focus on the impact of missionary Chinese education on language learning.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now, let's first understand how missionary Chinese education entered China.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
In fact, the spread of religion is very long and has a great impact on the interaction of various nations around the world.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
China's earliest external religious exchange was Buddhist culture.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What impact does Buddhist culture have on China?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
At that time, there was a lot of communication between Buddhism and Chinese in the Wei, Jin, Nan, and North Dynasties.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This actually stimulated the development of Chinese linguistics.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Chinese linguistics is said to be four-vowels.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
One of the characteristics of Chinese linguistics is that we have a tone.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The missionary Chinese education did not come from the West.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
However, what we are discussing today is the missionary of the West.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I emphasize that there is systematic learning of Chinese.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In fact, Catholicism has been passed down in China for a long time.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A while ago, there was a very famous TV series called The Twelve Hours of Chang'an.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Many people may have seen it.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It talks about the Great Qing Jin religion.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In fact, it is the Eastern Catholicism at that time.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is based on Syrian literature.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There is a Persian prince in it.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It represents the entry of Catholicism at that time.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
However, as early as the Tang Dynasty,

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
there was already a translation of the Tantric literature version.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
However, the Catholicism has been in contact with China for a long time.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In the Song Dynasty, the Catholicism has become more subdued.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In the Yuan Dynasty, the Catholicism has reached another peak.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We know that the Yuan Dynasty people have a so-called Sermon people.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The Sermon people are Westerners.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A story that everyone is familiar with is the Marco Polo travel diary.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Marco Polo is a businessman.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He came to the Yuan Dynasty with some religious missions and met the emperor.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Later, Pope Francis sent him directly to the Yuan Dynasty to make contact with China.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
However, these contacts did not really become a systematic study of Chinese.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The real beginning of Chinese research is still at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
At the end of the Ming Dynasty, at the end of the 16th century,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the Jesuit Church was established in France.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Jesuit Church has a strong mission to preach,

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and they are willing to go to the distant Far East to explore.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The second point is the great breakthrough and invention of the sea.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The people we just talked about are all through the road,

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
which we are more familiar with is the Silk Road to China.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The road is very far away.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is more difficult and dangerous.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The Jesuit Church at the end of the Ming Dynasty is mostly through the Silk Road.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Jesuit Church went from the Silk Road to Haowangjiao,

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
then to the Middle East, and then to India.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's look at the two peak periods.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The first is the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the end of the 16th century.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The second is the second peak period after the Opium War.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In the early period, it was mainly the Catholic Church in Europe.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
After the middle of the 19th century,

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
it was the new era of the Jesuit Church.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The real long-term and continuous impact

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is actually more concentrated after the middle of the 19th century.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now let's see how these missionary Chinese studies have affected China.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
First of all, many of our friends online

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
are teachers and predecessors in the Chinese education field.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How did Chinese education become an independent subject?

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Today, many people think that

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
after the Second World War,

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it separated from traditional Chinese studies.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In fact, it may have started to separate earlier, at this time.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The original Chinese and Chinese studies,

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that is, the synology we are talking about,

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
cannot be distinguished.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
With the arrival of Luo Mingjian,

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
these people brought back a large number of Chinese classics

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and translated them into Latin.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then it spread to Europe.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We know that this is the Chinese heat of the enlightenment period.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The Sun King Louis XIV was very fond of Chinese culture,

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
especially the rise of rationalism.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They found that the distant Eastern Empire was godless.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They were very curious about the idea of ​​godlessness in Confucianism.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So at that time in Paris,

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
the Chinese hot trend was the fashion of the upper-class society.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you have to wear Chinese silk, drink Chinese tea,

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and discuss the Four Books and Five Sutras.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is the rise of Chinese Chinese studies.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
However, at this time,

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because China and the West did not have direct contact,

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Chinese studies at this time focused on the study of thought and culture,

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and there was no need for actual language communication.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
However, with the large number of Jesuits sent to China,

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
they actually began to come into contact with China.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
These Jesuits had a need for preaching,

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so they began to actively study Chinese.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Therefore, these Jesuits in China

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
began to independently develop language learning,

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Chinese-language second language learning,

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
into an independent subject,

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and made a distinction with Chinese studies based on thought.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
For example, Gu Saifeng and Dai Suiliang,

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
who were the priests of the Jesuits,

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
began to write professional Chinese textbooks,

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
such as Chinese Introduction.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Next is the New Religion.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The New Religion I'm talking about

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is the so-called Christian religion.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In the missionary history of the US Department of State,

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
as you are familiar with,

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wei Sanwei also published a ten-chapter text in English.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This ten-chapter ten refers to ten difficulties,

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
from the most basic words,

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to the conversation in Chinese,

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to the final reading material.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is what makes Chinese studies

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
an independent subject.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is the first impact.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The second impact is the development of Chinese-language language learning.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In our traditional Chinese primary schools,

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
as you are familiar with,

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the study of Chinese characters,

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is based on the study of Chinese characters.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The emphasis is on the character,

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but the study of grammar has not been developed.

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
For Western Chinese-language learners,

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
especially those with Latin and Romance languages,

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
there is a huge difference in grammar.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is very difficult for them to learn.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Even in the early days,

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
when they were reading literature,

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the literature was very simple.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In addition to the grammar,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
it was very difficult for them to grasp.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They even mistakenly thought that

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
there was no grammar in Chinese.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Recently,

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the study of Chinese teaching history

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
has become more popular,

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so a lot of information has been discovered.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Some of the information that you may be familiar with

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is probably on my side.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There are some relatively new sayings.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
First of all,

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in the first book,

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
a Chinese-language book

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
written by a teacher from Laihua,

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
is written by Huankobo,

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the father of the Taoism Society.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This book is actually dead.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It was because modern scholars

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
were studying the history of Chinese teaching,

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and they found that

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
this book was mentioned

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
in the internal documents of the Taoism Society.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So it was designated as the earliest Chinese book.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In addition,

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
there is a book called

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Huangjialue,

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
which is probably the first book

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
written in Chinese.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There are many scholars in the mainland

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
who have been designated

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
as scholars

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
from China

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to France.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Huangjialue is probably the first book.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
However,

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
this book

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
was written in France.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Secondly,

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
it was not executed.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In fact,

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it was not widely promoted.

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And is it written by Huangjialue?

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There is still some controversy.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I won't talk about it here.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I will focus on the research of

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Western missionary language.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The second book

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
is probably the book

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
that has become the conclusion

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
over the past few years,

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which is the book

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of Wei Kuanguo's Chinese Literature.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This book is written in Latin.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It was written in Latin

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
until the beginning of the 20th century.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Of course,

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it is now in English.

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So almost all the early

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
letters in the church

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
are probably written in Latin.

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He wrote this book

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
in Chinese.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This book is

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
circulated in the form of a manuscript.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
His manuscript

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
still exists

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in several versions.

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Several libraries

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
in the church still have it.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
One of the characteristics of this book

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is that it discusses grammar

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
in the second and third chapters,

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and for the first time

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
makes the difference between Chinese and Latin.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The difference between Latin and Chinese.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He also found that the characteristics of Chinese

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
are that there is no gender.

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There is no gender.

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There is no gender.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There is no

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
gender.

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There is no gender.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's take a look.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There is another book.

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ten years ago,

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it was discussed

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that Ji Wanguo's Chinese Guanhua Grammar.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This book is

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the earliest

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
widely printed

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
grammar book.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was also

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
a very popular

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
grammar book

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What has a deeper impact

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is the Chinese Zha Ji

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
written by Ma Ruose.

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
One of the characteristics of this book

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
is that the book was written

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in 1728.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He had already first

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
studied the grammar of

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Chinese and Latin.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In addition,

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in the analysis of the grammar of Chinese and Latin,

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the sentences he used

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
were a large number of sentences

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
quoted in the novel

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
.

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
At the same time, he noticed that

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the words were divided into

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
real words and imaginary words.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He kept some local dialects.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
For example,

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
when he quoted the Water Tiger Diamond,

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
he used a large number of Shandong dialects.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It is a historical

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
language

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
presentation.

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It is a very real

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
grammar book.

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Next,

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
let's talk about the impact of this book.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This impact is very direct.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We are all very familiar with

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the first Chinese grammar book

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
written by Ma Ruose.

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The author of Ma Ruose

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is Ma Jianzhong.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It can be said that

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ma Jianzhong's writing of Ma Ruose

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
was influenced by the grammar book

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
of the Western missionary.

297
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's take a look.

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ma Jianzhong himself was from Zhejiang.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
At that time, he was called Dan Tu.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dan Tu is the name of a school

301
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in Xuhui, Shanghai.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you are from Taiwan,

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you probably know that

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Xuhui High School

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
is the name of a school

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
in Luzhou,

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Xinbei City.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's right.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Xuhui High School

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is the name of a school

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
in Xuhui, Shanghai.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It is a middle school

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
established by

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ma Jianzhong

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in Xuhui.

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
At that time,

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ma Jianzhong was also

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
a member of Xuhui.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He was very familiar

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
with these French priests.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He studied Latin grammar

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and wrote a book called

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Ma Shi Wen Tong.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It is worth mentioning that

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ma Jianzhong's family

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
was Catholic.

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He had a very famous brother

328
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
who later became a monk.

329
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He was the founder

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
of Furen University

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
in Beijing.

332
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ma Jianzhong

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
was also a representative

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
from Europe.

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ma Shi Wen Tong

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
studied Chinese grammar

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
in a thorough way.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He wrote a lot of books

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
about the grammar of words.

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He did a thorough research.

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ma Shi Wen Tong's book

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
was very helpful

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in modern Chinese grammar

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
study.

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It was influenced

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
by Zhang Shizhao's

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Middle Chinese Dictionary,

348
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Li Jingxi's

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
New Chinese Grammar,

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Lu Shuxiang's

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and Wang Li's works.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Next,

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I would like to compare

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the analysis

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
of the vocabulary

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
of Ma Shi Wen Tong's book.

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The first book

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is Wei Kuanguo's

359
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Chinese Grammar in 1651.

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
As you can see,

361
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
he divided Chinese vocabulary

362
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
into nine categories.

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We are all very familiar with it.

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Next,

365
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Ma Shi Wen Tong's Chinese Dictionary

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
has six categories.

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What is special

368
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
is that

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Wei Kuanguo

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

371
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
into nouns.

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The Chinese Dictionary

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
into nouns.

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ma Shi Wen Tong

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
into nouns.

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He classified the Chinese vocabulary

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
into subordinate words.

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He studied the subordinate words separately.

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's look at

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the book

383
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
which has become

384
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Lu Shuxiang's

385
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Chinese Dictionary

386
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
in the early 1980s.

387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He classified the Chinese vocabulary

388
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
into twelve categories.

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He added the subordinate words

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and the subordinate words.

391
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We can see

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that the Chinese Dictionary

393
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
which has been classified

394
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
for more than 300 years

395
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is still based on

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
the earliest Chinese Dictionary

397
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
in 1651.

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The third factor

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is the appearance

400
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
of Chinese alphabets.

401
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We all know that

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the traditional Chinese alphabets

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
are pronounced in the opposite way.

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They are pronounced

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
in the opposite way

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
in Chinese characters.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They are pronounced in the opposite way

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
in Chinese characters.

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is the way

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Chinese alphabets have been used

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
for a long time.

412
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The Chinese alphabets

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
are classified into

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the subordinate words

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and the subordinate words.

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Therefore,

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it is very difficult

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
for a native speaker

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to learn Chinese alphabets

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
or a non-native speaker

421
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
to learn Chinese alphabets.

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
After Li Maodou

423
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
came to China,

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
he first tried to

425
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
pronounce Chinese alphabets

426
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but he failed.

427
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
On the one hand,

428
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the Chinese alphabets

429
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
were changed

430
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
from the Ming Dynasty

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to the Qing Dynasty.

432
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
At that time,

433
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
the Chinese alphabets

434
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
were introduced

435
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
from the south to China.

436
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
In addition to the dialects

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
of Guangdong,

438
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the Chinese alphabets

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
were introduced

440
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
from the north to the south.

441
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
At that time,

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the official language of Guangdong

443
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
was Manchurian.

444
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Therefore,

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the Chinese alphabets

446
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
were studied

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in different regions.

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The next one

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
is a heavy-weighted work,

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
which is

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the work of

452
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the father of

453
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Genghis Khan.

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He studied the books

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
of the Ming Dynasty

456
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and translated the Chinese alphabets

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
into

458
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
the Western

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
alphabets.

460
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He only used

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
25 alphabets

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and 5 tones.

463
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
At that time,

464
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
the 5 tones

465
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
included the Chinese alphabets

466
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
so there was one more tone

467
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
than now.

468
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now,

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
let's look at

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the Chinese alphabets.

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This is the

472
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Chinese alphabet

473
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
of Sirurmuz.

474
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Although it is not clear,

475
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
it is presented

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in a compass-shaped way.

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The Chinese alphabets

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
were translated

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in the way of

480
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
putting the sound

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
inside and

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
out.

483
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's continue

484
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to look at

485
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
how the Chinese alphabets

486
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
of Sirurmuz

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
influenced the development

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
of Chinese alphabets.

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sirurmuz's significance

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
is that

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
using Latin alphabets

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to analyze Chinese alphabets

493
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
has always been

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
seen as a complicated

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and difficult task.

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It has a great impact

497
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
on the later

498
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Chinese alphabets

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
such as Sirurmuz,

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sirurmuz,

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Sirurmuz,

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sirurmuz,

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Sirurmuz,

504
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Sirurmuz,

505
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Sirurmuz,

506
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sirurmuz,

507
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Sirurmuz,

508
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Sirurmuz,

509
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Latin and Romance alphabets

510
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
had a big impact

511
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
on the success

512
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
of cutting alphabets

513
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
of Chinese alphabets.

514
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Eulius Dirich,

515
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
the pope who came from

516
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:08,960


517
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
in the middle of the 19th century

518
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
was an American

519
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,960
who studied Chinese 싶은

520
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
We know that

521
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
Chinese characters are hard to learn.

522
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
He felt that

523
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,700
Chinese characters were

524
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
unreasonable.

525
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
So he wrote a paper

526
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
in the Chinese Newspaper

527
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
and he was the first to argue

528
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
that Chinese characters should

529
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
be replaced by Pinyin.

530
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
The reason he argued

531
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
was very intense.

532
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
First, he thought

533
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
that an excellent language

534
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
should be Pinyin.

535
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
He even said that

536
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
alphabets,

537
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
such as the Egyptian alphabet,

538
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
should be replaced by Pinyin.

539
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
He felt that

540
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Chinese characters should be

541
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
eliminated from the

542
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
progress of language.

543
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
He also suggested

544
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
that Chinese characters

545
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
should be replaced

546
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
by Pinyin.

547
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
He said that

548
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Chinese characters

549
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
are hard to learn.

550
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Chinese children

551
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
should learn

552
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
because

553
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Chinese characters

554
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
are hard to learn.

555
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Wei Sanwei

556
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
agreed with this argument.

557
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
He continued to

558
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
argue in the Chinese Newspaper.

559
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
At the beginning of

560
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
the Qing Dynasty,

561
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
there were many

562
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
intellectuals

563
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
who recognized

564
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
the old China.

565
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
For example, Xuantong, Chen Duxiu,

566
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
etc.

567
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Even Hu Shi

568
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
said that

569
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Chinese characters

570
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
should be replaced

571
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,700
by Pinyin.

572
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
This led to

573
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
the famous

574
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Chinese-Latin movement

575
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
in the early years of the Republic of China.

576
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Of course,

577
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
the Chinese-Latin movement

578
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
did not succeed

579
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
in 2021.

580
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Because there are too many dialects in China,

581
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
there is no way

582
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
to use one Pinyin

583
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
to represent all dialects.

584
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Second,

585
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
there are too many homonyms in China.

586
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
In addition, there is a difference

587
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
between spoken Chinese and spoken Chinese.

588
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Without Chinese characters,

589
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
there is no way

590
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
to express it correctly.

591
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
So Pinyin

592
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
did not replace Chinese characters.

593
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
However,

594
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Chinese characters

595
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
were replaced by Pinyin

596
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
in the 18th century.

597
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
This is directly

598
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
due to the influence

599
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
of the Roman Pinyin

600
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
of the Western missionary.

601
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Fourth,

602
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
missionary Chinese

603
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
has also improved

604
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
the status

605
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
of traditional Chinese literature.

606
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Chinese literature

607
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
has always been

608
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
about poetry.

609
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Poetry

610
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
can not be counted.

611
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
However,

612
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
the novelist

613
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
has always been

614
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
compared to the literati.

615
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
From the Chinese characters,

616
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
the author said

617
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
that the novelist Liu

618
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
is a hearsay.

619
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
He is not as good as Liu.

620
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
This idea

621
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
has been

622
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
passed down

623
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
from generation to generation.

624
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
The author did not

625
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
accept the novel.

626
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
He did not accept the novel

627
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
of Zhang Hui.

628
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
He accepted the short stories

629
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
of the literary world.

630
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
However,

631
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
he did not accept the four great novels.

632
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Why?

633
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Because he felt that the four great novels

634
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
were very vulgar.

635
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
However,

636
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
after the Western missionary

637
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
came to China,

638
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
he made a big change.

639
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
In French literature,

640
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
novels and plays

641
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
are very important.

642
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
The Chinese literature of France

643
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
started to pay attention

644
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
to Chinese novels and plays

645
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
very early on.

646
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
The missionary

647
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
also found that

648
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
the novels of Zhang Hui

649
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
and Baihua

650
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
were very rich in

651
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
folk customs

652
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
and life records.

653
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Therefore,

654
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
the missionary

655
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
started to use

656
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
the novels of Zhang Hui

657
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
as a Chinese textbook.

658
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
In the book

659
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
of Ma Ruose,

660
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
he used the sentences

661
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
of the novels of Zhang Hui

662
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
as an example.

663
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Let's take a look

664
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
at the book of Ma Ruose.

665
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
The French priest

666
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
of the Jesuit Church

667
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
named Andre Gaulle

668
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
translated the book

669
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
of Ma Ruose

670
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
as a textbook.

671
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
He translated

672
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
the book of Ma Ruose

673
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
as a textbook.

674
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
He translated the book

675
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
of Ma Ruose

676
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
as a textbook.

677
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Ma Ruose

678
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
also translated

679
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
the book of Ma Ruose

680
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
as a textbook.

681
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
He translated the book

of Ma Ruose

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
as a textbook.

684
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
In addition,

685
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
the missionary

686
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
from the United States

687
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
named Wittema

688
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
translated the book

689
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
of Ma Ruose

690
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
as a textbook.

691
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
Wittema

692
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
translated the book

693
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
of Ma Ruose

694
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
as a textbook.

695
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
In addition,

696
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
the missionaries

697
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
from the West

698
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
also tried to

699
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
create novels of Zhang Hui.

700
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
For example,

701
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Ma Ruose

702
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,700
wrote a novel

703
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,700
about Confucianism

704
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
with the purpose

705
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
of teaching.

706
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
The missionaries

707
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
from the West

708
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
were interested

709
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
in the novel

710
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
of Zhang Hui.

711
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
The missionaries

712
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
were interested

713
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
in the novel

714
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
of Zhang Hui.

715
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Especially,

716
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
were close

719
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
to the Chinese

720
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700

The missionaries

724
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700

725
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700

1033
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
were close

1034
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
to the Chinese

1035
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
and were interested

1036
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
in the novel

1037
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
of Zhang Hui.

1038
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
The missionaries

1039
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
from the West

1040
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
were close

1041
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
to the Chinese

1042
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
and were interested

1043
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
in the novel

1044
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
of Zhang Hui.

1045
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I have some questions,

1046
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
but I'd like to ask

1047
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
them later.

1048
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I'd like to ask them later.

1049
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I'd like to ask them later.

1050
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,700
I'd like to ask them later.

1051
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I think

1052
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
I'd like to ask

1053
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
questions

1054
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
like

1055
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
the question

1056
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
of

1057
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Ning Shen.

1058
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Because

1059
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
you mainly talk about

1060
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
the missionaries from the West.

1061
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
I'd like to know

1062
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
how you define

1063
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
the missionaries

1064
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
from the West.

1065
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
I'd like to know

1066
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
how you define

1067
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
the missionaries

1068
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
from the West.

1069
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I know

1070
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
some of them

1071
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
are from different countries

1072
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
and some of them

1073
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
are from different countries

1074
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
and some of them

1075
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
are from different countries

1076
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
and some of them

1077
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
are from different countries

1078
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
and some of them

1079
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
have different accents

1080
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
and accents.

1081
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
Do you think

1082
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
their analysis

1083
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
of Chinese

1084
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
has an impact?

1085
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Because, as you said,

1086
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
their main purpose

1087
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
is to preach.

1088
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Their main purpose

1089
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
is to preach.

1090
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
I talked about

1091
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
their interpretation

1092
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
of the Bible

1093
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
to help them preach

1094
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
and communicate.

1095
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
But before that,

1096
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
because the Chinese culture

1097
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
and language

1098
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
flowed into

1099
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Europe

1100
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
and they

1101
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
read written language

1102
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
and read written language

1103
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
instead of conversation.

1104
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
instead of conversation.

1105
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
I'd like to know

1106
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
because...

1107
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
What's my question?

1108
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Because their purpose

1109
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
is different.

1110
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
I'd like to know

1111
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
if this has an impact

1112
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
on their Chinese learning

1113
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
and analysis.

1114
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
If you want

1115
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
to read literature

1116
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
and analyze literature,

1117
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
the emphasis is different.

1118
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Is there a mismatch?

1119
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Is there a mismatch?

1120
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Next,

1121
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
as you mentioned,

1122
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
they've been

1123
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
learning Chinese

1124
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
in different places

1125
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
for a long time.

1126
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,700
for a long time.

1127
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
As you mentioned,

1128
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
there's a Shandong dialect.

1129
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
There's a Shandong dialect.

1130
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
Francesco Varo,

1131
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
a Spanish missionary,

1132
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
he read

1133
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
the White Paper

1134
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
in 1728.

1135
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
It's a Shandong dialect.

1136
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
So, I'd like to know...

1137
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,700
He read it in Shandong dialect.

1138
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,700
He read it in Shandong dialect.

1139
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
So, I'd like to know...

1140
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
I'd like to know...

1141
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,700
I'd like to know...

1142
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700
I'd like to know...

1143
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
I'd like to know...

1144
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
I'd like to know...

1145
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,700
I'd like to know...

1146
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
I'd like to know...

1147
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,700
How does learning Chinese

1148
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,700
affect their

1149
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Chinese learning?

1150
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
How does learning Chinese

1151
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
affect their

1152
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Korean learning?

1153
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,700
They've an
