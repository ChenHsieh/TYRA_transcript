0	10000	Today, we are honored to have Dr. Teng-Ting Yun with us to discuss today's lecture.
10000	17000	Today's topic is Data Crisis in Astronomy, Machine Learning Techniques to Galaxy Studies.
17000	22000	Before we start the lecture, let me introduce Teng-Yun first.
23000	32000	Teng-Yun is now at the Center for Extragalactic Astronomy at Durham University in the UK.
32000	35000	She is an astrophysicist.
35000	39000	She got her bachelor's and master's degree in Taiwan.
39000	43000	Then she went to Nottingham, also in the UK, and got her doctorate.
43000	46000	She got her doctorate last year.
46000	54000	Her main interest is galactic evolution and formation.
54000	62000	She is now focusing on machine learning techniques for galaxy study.
62000	71000	In today's lecture, she will talk about her specialty, machine learning for galaxy study.
71000	74000	She will also talk about her past work.
74000	80000	She will also talk about how machine learning will help galaxy study in the future.
80000	87000	Now, let's welcome Teng-Yun with a round of applause.
93000	95000	Thank you, everyone.
96000	98000	Thank you, everyone.
98000	102000	Thank you, Chair, for the warm introduction.
102000	106000	Hello, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, and good night.
106000	108000	I'm Teng-Yun.
108000	111000	I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Durham University.
111000	114000	I'd like to apologize to everyone first.
114000	117000	I think I'm going to talk a lot in Chinese and English.
117000	120000	Because I can't show my speaker notes.
120000	123000	I usually speak in English.
123000	126000	So my Chinese sometimes gets stuck.
126000	132000	What I'd like to share with you today is about machine learning.
132000	136000	It's becoming more and more popular in astronomy.
136000	141000	This is a research topic for my postdoctoral research.
141000	144000	I'm going to share with you some papers I did in my postdoctoral research.
144000	148000	First of all, let me introduce myself.
148000	150000	What is an astronomer?
150000	154000	Basically, every time I tell everyone that I'm an astronomer,
154000	158000	everyone has a different idea of what an astronomer is.
158000	160000	Most of the time, people will ask me,
160000	164000	Do you know what the meteorite of Saturn is?
164000	167000	Or people will point to a star in the sky and ask me,
167000	169000	Do you know what that star is?
169000	172000	I have to be honest and say I really don't know.
172000	176000	If I tell people I'm a postdoctoral researcher,
176000	178000	my mom will exaggerate and say,
178000	180000	Do you know that my daughter is a professor?
180000	182000	It's not that exaggerated.
182000	184000	Mom, please calm down.
184000	188000	If you are an astronomer or a theoretical astronomer,
188000	191000	the most common thing we do every day is to use a computer.
191000	194000	We're not writing code, we're debugging.
194000	198000	Especially what we do most often is data analysis.
198000	203000	You may be analyzing certain stars.
203000	209000	Or like me, I'm analyzing big data.
209000	214000	I may be analyzing hundreds of thousands or even millions of galaxies at a time.
216000	219000	I'm interested in two directions.
219000	221000	One is information classification,
221000	223000	which is Galaxy Morphological Classification.
223000	226000	The other part is more cosmological.
226000	230000	I do Lama Napa Forest or IGN-CGN.
230000	234000	I don't know what this term means.
234000	238000	Because today I'm going to focus on information classification.
238000	243000	It's relatively straightforward.
245000	250000	This is the most famous information classification system.
250000	253000	It's categorized by human eyes.
253000	255000	It's called Hubble Sequence.
255000	260000	It's a name given by a famous astronomer, Hubble.
260000	264000	Information classification can be divided into many types.
264000	266000	You can classify according to different brightness,
266000	269000	or different degree of evolution,
269000	271000	or even different information structures.
271000	278000	Unfortunately, human eye classification is the most commonly used system in astronomy.
278000	284000	We've been using Hubble Sequence for almost 100 years.
285000	288000	As for big data,
288000	295000	I'm showing you the data from various surveys in recent years.
295000	297000	As you can see from the left side,
297000	306000	the data you can see in the astronomy survey is about 1TB.
306000	314000	In the future, we expect to break through the 1TB scale.
314000	318000	So we find that the data is growing very fast.
318000	322000	Because of computer technology, we can store a lot of data.
322000	326000	But the problem is that in astronomy,
326000	334000	we can't handle such a large amount of data in a traditional way.
334000	340000	We have data, but we can't handle it.
340000	350000	Let me show you the big data.
350000	356000	Since 2005, SDSS has been a very famous large-scale field tracking program.
356000	362000	It has observed about 50 million stars.
363000	367000	But in fact, we've done a lot of analysis,
367000	370000	and we've done a lot of detailed research.
370000	374000	There are only about 1 million stars.
374000	379000	You know that the speed of our analysis is very, very slow.
379000	383000	It's far less than the speed of our data generation.
383000	389000	The most famous program in information classification is Galaxy Zoo.
389000	398000	Galaxy Zoo is a program that invites people from all over the world to do information classification together.
398000	402000	Because you can imagine that information classification is actually a very straightforward thing.
402000	405000	You can look at a star and see if it has a spiral.
405000	410000	Then you can analyze whether it is an elliptical star or a spiral star.
410000	414000	Galaxy Zoo thinks that people from all over the world can do this kind of thing.
414000	419000	So they let the general public participate in this information classification program.
419000	424000	But even if they gather people from all over the world to do this kind of analysis,
424000	431000	they only classified about 900,000 galaxies in about three years.
431000	438000	So you know that if, for example, the data I'm doing right now is DAS data.
438000	446000	The initial data for this part of the data is about 30 trillion galaxies.
446000	453000	The analysis I did in my paper is about 2 trillion galaxies.
453000	458000	So you know that if we want to do it in a traditional way today,
458000	460000	we need to analyze it in a human way.
460000	463000	Even if we do it in the way of Galaxy Zoo,
463000	465000	you may not be able to finish it in your life.
465000	468000	So we need some help at this time.
468000	473000	When we say we are in trouble, I always say I am in trouble.
473000	478000	I can't do this kind of large-scale survey analysis because I have too much data.
478000	484000	At this time, many people will start to seek help from machine learning.
484000	486000	This is my topic today.
486000	501000	Here you can see the recent paper on machine learning in astronomy.
501000	506000	You can see that there has been an exponential growth in the past few years.
506000	509000	More and more papers are doing related things.
509000	513000	I started to read the textbook in 2017.
513000	516000	When I was reading the textbook, I was very impressed.
516000	518000	At that time, basically no one was doing it.
518000	521000	Everyone is just starting to do it.
521000	525000	But after that, I will probably have a new paper every day.
525000	531000	I will see a new paper every day talking about machine learning applications.
531000	534000	Let me talk about it.
534000	540000	In astronomy, I think it's pretty much the same in computer science.
541000	554000	Machine learning applications are roughly divided into supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised.
554000	557000	Of course, there are other more detailed things.
557000	558000	I won't talk about it for the time being.
558000	560000	This is a more general classification.
560000	563000	I will talk about these three categories later.
563000	566000	So my talk today will be more technical.
566000	571000	If you have any questions that you are not familiar with machine learning, you can ask me right away.
571000	572000	It doesn't matter.
572000	579000	In terms of applications, you can roughly divide it into three different questions.
579000	583000	You can do classification, or you can do regression.
583000	586000	You want to predict a continuous value.
586000	588000	Or you can do data generation.
588000	591000	These are the things that machine learning can help with.
591000	594000	I basically have a list of these three.
594000	597000	But I'm going to focus on the classification problem today.
597000	608000	In terms of its purpose, most of the things we want to do in astronomy are what I just said.
608000	610000	Because we have a lot of data.
610000	615000	But our traditional way of analyzing is far less than dealing with this data.
615000	620000	The biggest problem is that we want to deal with efficiency issues.
620000	629000	A large part of it is related to how we measure quantity.
629000	639000	Machine learning can basically help us improve the accuracy of some measurements.
639000	647000	So the two main purposes of machine learning are to improve efficiency and accuracy.
648000	655000	But today, in addition to these two, I want to talk to you about what else we can do.
655000	661000	What else we can do with machine learning?
661000	666000	You can be more creative when it comes to machine learning.
668000	672000	To sum up what I just said, it's a long start.
672000	675000	I'm going to divide it into two parts today.
675000	678000	The first part is very short.
678000	684000	It's about how to improve efficiency and accuracy.
684000	688000	The second part is about what else you can do.
688000	694000	I'm going to focus on unsupervised machine learning and self-supervised machine learning.
697000	700000	Let's go back to the very beginning, the Hubble sequence.
700000	702000	Let's simplify the problem now.
702000	705000	I don't know what you think of the Hubble sequence.
705000	709000	But I'm going to try to explain it in a way that's not my area of expertise.
709000	712000	So my explanation is going to be a little more shallow.
712000	715000	You can usually divide the Hubble sequence into two categories.
715000	718000	The elliptic sequence and the spiral sequence.
718000	720000	It's very simple to classify them.
720000	722000	There's the concept of a spiral coin.
722000	726000	I don't know if you can see my mouse.
726000	729000	Can you see my mouse?
730000	733000	The spiral coin is very obvious.
733000	736000	It's the shape of a spiral.
736000	741000	As long as there's a spiral coin, we define it as a spiral sequence.
741000	744000	The other is to define it as a elliptic sequence.
744000	751000	So far, you can just say that it's a very straightforward, very simple thing to classify.
751000	757000	So that's why Galaxy Zoo can get the public to help with this.
758000	763000	I'm sorry, can I ask a question?
763000	766000	I'd like to ask a naive question.
766000	771000	Why are all the stars in the galaxy in the shape of a circle?
771000	776000	Is there a possibility that they're in the shape of a triangle?
776000	779000	Yes, there is.
779000	783000	As you can see, they're in the shape of a circle because of the projection.
784000	788000	In fact, every star has a depth.
788000	793000	In terms of elliptical stars, they're basically like a ball.
793000	796000	They're like a ball in a triangular space.
796000	803000	Their light distribution is also the shape of a ball.
803000	809000	But if you look at a spiral star today, it's more like a disk.
809000	812000	So if you project it to 3D today,
812000	818000	the distribution of light will be more like a disk, not a ball.
818000	821000	So this is also in the galaxy.
821000	827000	So my question is, why are some of them in the shape of a disk,
827000	831000	instead of a triangular elliptical shape?
831000	833000	That's a good question.
834000	839000	This question is mainly related to the evolution of stars.
839000	843000	For example, this question is a bit difficult to answer.
843000	846000	But it's mainly related to the evolution of stars.
846000	850000	Our current theory is that
850000	853000	we start with the spiral galaxy.
853000	862000	How do I say it in Mandarin?
862000	864000	Can I speak English?
864000	866000	Yes, you can.
866000	870000	For spiral galaxies, they think that in the beginning,
870000	875000	you will have some gas that accretions into this structure.
875000	877000	It's not like a ball.
877000	880000	It's more like a disk.
880000	883000	It's a flat disk.
883000	887000	It's in the shape of an accretion disk.
887000	890000	It's not like a whole ball.
890000	894000	It's not like a whole ball.
894000	897000	In our understanding,
897000	901000	the main formation of stars should start from that.
901000	904000	So in our understanding,
904000	906000	the spiral galaxy is formed first.
906000	910000	Gradually, the two galaxies merge together.
910000	913000	After the momentum dissipates,
913000	916000	it slowly forms the shape of a ball.
916000	921000	Because the shape of a ball is more like an accretion disk.
921000	923000	Does this answer your question?
923000	924000	Yes.
924000	926000	It's okay. We can discuss it later.
926000	927000	Okay.
927000	931000	This part is actually quite long.
931000	934000	It's not related to what I talked about today.
936000	940000	The first part is supervised learning.
940000	943000	Let me tell you what supervised learning is.
943000	946000	Supervised machine learning is a very simple concept.
946000	948000	We feed a picture to the machine.
948000	950000	Then we give it a label.
950000	954000	For example, I tell the machine that this is a dog.
954000	956000	Then I tell it that this is a fried chicken.
956000	958000	Then I feed it a lot of pictures.
958000	961000	Pictures of different dogs and fried chickens.
961000	964000	After the machine learns,
964000	969000	it will ask the dog if it is a dog or a fried chicken.
969000	971000	This is the concept of supervised learning.
971000	976000	Supervised learning is a very common concept.
976000	980000	In my 2020 paper,
980000	987000	I studied 10 different supervised machine learning algorithms.
987000	990000	Today I will focus on the Confluential Neural Network.
990000	995000	Let me briefly introduce the Confluential Neural Network
995000	998000	to those who are not familiar with machine learning.
998000	1001000	The idea is that we have Confluential Layers
1001000	1003000	to do feature extraction.
1003000	1006000	What Confluential Layers is actually doing
1006000	1010000	is a bit like a filter concept.
1010000	1014000	It actually wants to capture some features
1014000	1019000	that can best represent your image.
1019000	1022000	When you want to produce these labels,
1022000	1024000	what are the key points?
1024000	1026000	What are the key points for the machine to make judgments?
1026000	1031000	Which part of this image is the key point for the machine to make judgments?
1031000	1033000	In Confluential Layers,
1033000	1036000	for example, the first layer has 6 channels.
1036000	1039000	Each channel uses different metrics.
1039000	1042000	Basically, it's a different filter concept.
1042000	1046000	You will get 6 different images here.
1047000	1049000	After passing the filter, you will get 6 different images.
1049000	1051000	Layer by layer,
1051000	1054000	the machine will gradually learn
1054000	1062000	which part of the image is the most important part for you to make judgments.
1062000	1065000	The machine will gradually learn this.
1065000	1068000	Let's look at the dog's side.
1068000	1069000	Here is a concept.
1069000	1075000	This is a heat map to show which part is really worth paying attention to.
1075000	1076000	The machine will ask,
1076000	1078000	where is that part of attention?
1078000	1082000	If you want to identify which part is worth paying attention to,
1082000	1090000	the machine will find out which part is worth paying attention to.
1090000	1093000	The red part is where I need to pay attention to.
1093000	1097000	Next, they will input these extracted features
1097000	1101000	to fully connect layers.
1101000	1102000	After this,
1102000	1106000	they will connect all the features together
1106000	1109000	and use the softmax function
1109000	1112000	to give a probability concept.
1112000	1113000	For example,
1113000	1118000	if it's a dog or a cat,
1118000	1120000	based on this probability,
1120000	1122000	the machine can give a category.
1122000	1126000	This is what the Confluential Neural Network is doing.
1127000	1132000	Now, let's look at the example of a dog and a fried chicken.
1132000	1133000	In my example,
1133000	1136000	I input galaxy images.
1136000	1139000	My image is from dark energy survey.
1139000	1141000	Based on this image,
1141000	1149000	I use Galaxy Zoo's visual classification to train my machine.
1150000	1152000	Basically, I tell my machine,
1152000	1154000	this galaxy is elliptical,
1154000	1156000	and this galaxy is spiral.
1156000	1160000	After the machine learns the concept,
1160000	1161000	it will ask the machine,
1161000	1168000	is this new galaxy elliptical or spiral?
1168000	1171000	In this part of the study,
1171000	1175000	we get some interesting results.
1175000	1177000	In the first part,
1177000	1179000	we found that some galaxies,
1179000	1185000	CNN is very sure that it is a spiral galaxy.
1185000	1186000	However,
1186000	1191000	when we look at Galaxy Zoo's classification,
1191000	1194000	we found that they think it is elliptical.
1194000	1196000	Later, we found that
1196000	1200000	because the depth data has a better resolution
1200000	1202000	and a deeper depth,
1202000	1206000	it can observe a deeper scene.
1206000	1207000	Therefore,
1207000	1213000	the data used in Galaxy Zoo is better.
1213000	1214000	You can see that
1214000	1216000	in the two images I show,
1216000	1218000	they are all the same depth.
1218000	1219000	However,
1219000	1221000	the depth data on the left
1221000	1224000	clearly shows a spiral arm structure.
1224000	1225000	However,
1225000	1229000	the SDSS data on the right is not visible.
1229000	1235000	Galaxy Zoo is based on SDSS data to do visual classification.
1235000	1236000	Therefore,
1236000	1237000	we found that
1237000	1242000	using our machine learning and depth data,
1242000	1246000	the most reliable visual classification catalog
1246000	1248000	needs to be updated.
1248000	1249000	We found that
1249000	1252000	about 2.5% of the galaxies are mislabeled
1252000	1254000	and need to be updated.
1254000	1256000	After the correction,
1257000	1259000	we found that
1259000	1262000	using binary classification,
1262000	1266000	we can achieve about 99% accuracy.
1266000	1268000	It's quite impressive.
1268000	1270000	In some cases,
1270000	1276000	it is almost more accurate than the human eye,
1276000	1279000	especially in darker conditions
1279000	1282000	or higher redshift conditions.
1282000	1284000	This is the heavy ending.
1284000	1285000	It sounds like
1285000	1288000	Galaxy classification using supervised machine learning
1288000	1290000	seems to be very reliable.
1290000	1292000	You can achieve 99% accuracy.
1292000	1294000	There's nothing to worry about.
1294000	1296000	But not quite yet.
1296000	1300000	You can probably imagine
1300000	1304000	that Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used
1304000	1306000	binary classification system.
1306000	1311000	Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used binary classification system.
1311000	1314000	It's based on the human eye.
1314000	1317000	I don't know how much confidence you have in humans,
1317000	1320000	but I don't have much confidence.
1320000	1323000	I think the human eye is very biased.
1323000	1328000	A lot of research shows that
1328000	1333000	even if two very professional astronomers
1333000	1336000	are doing the classification,
1336000	1339000	their results may not necessarily match.
1339000	1345000	Especially if the image resolution or image quality has changed,
1345000	1349000	the two people may have different opinions.
1351000	1355000	So let's take a look at Hubble Sequence again.
1355000	1357000	When we did supervised,
1357000	1359000	it was actually very simple.
1359000	1362000	We did the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.
1362000	1364000	But in fact, it's very detailed.
1364000	1367000	And you don't know why it can be so detailed.
1367000	1370000	I've been doing galaxy morphology for a long time,
1370000	1372000	but I still don't really understand
1372000	1374000	why they can be so detailed.
1374000	1376000	For example, like the spiral galaxies,
1376000	1382000	it can be divided into at least three different evolution stages.
1382000	1385000	A, B, and C.
1385000	1387000	They are different evolution states.
1387000	1390000	The elliptical star system is a little bit more understandable.
1390000	1392000	It's based on different ellipticity
1392000	1397000	and there are seven different stages.
1397000	1400000	Then there's another one that's more incomprehensible,
1400000	1402000	which is the lenticular galaxies.
1402000	1405000	Lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence
1405000	1410000	between the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.
1410000	1413000	And it doesn't have spiral arms.
1413000	1416000	It's basically obvious that it doesn't have spiral arms.
1416000	1419000	But sometimes it might be because of the resolution.
1419000	1425000	But it's more like a spiral galaxy in terms of structure.
1425000	1428000	So we think that
1428000	1431000	the current theory is that it's in the middle.
1431000	1434000	Maybe it's a transition period.
1434000	1437000	We also have another one called spiral bar galaxies.
1437000	1439000	It's in the middle.
1439000	1441000	There's a bar in the center of the star system.
1441000	1442000	This is called a bar galaxy.
1442000	1444000	And of course, there's the rest.
1444000	1446000	We really can't classify it.
1446000	1448000	It's called irregular galaxies.
1448000	1450000	It looks weird.
1450000	1454000	Then let's talk about the classification.
1454000	1456000	I don't know if you can...
1456000	1457000	I don't think you can leave a comment,
1457000	1459000	so you can turn on the microphone and say it.
1459000	1460000	Let's test it.
1460000	1462000	Can you tell which one is a spiral galaxy?
1467000	1469000	Actually, you can turn on the microphone and say it.
1469000	1470000	But you can also leave a comment.
1470000	1472000	If you want to vote to count it,
1472000	1474000	you can type it right next to it.
1475000	1477000	I don't think you can see the comments.
1477000	1478000	I can...
1478000	1479000	Because you're sharing the screen now.
1479000	1481000	But I can help you see it.
1481000	1483000	Someone said 3.
1485000	1486000	I'll type 4.
1488000	1489000	Someone said 4.
1489000	1491000	Now 1 also has one vote.
1493000	1494000	3. 3 also has one vote.
1494000	1495000	So 3 has two votes now.
1495000	1496000	4 has two votes now.
1496000	1497000	1 has one vote now.
1498000	1499000	2 is very popular.
1499000	1500000	There's no 2.
1500000	1501000	There's 1 and 3.
1502000	1503000	Yeah, that's about it.
1504000	1505000	Okay.
1505000	1507000	The answer to this question is 3.
1507000	1510000	3 is an early spiral galaxy.
1510000	1511000	It's a relatively early one.
1511000	1514000	You just saw the SA part.
1515000	1517000	This question is relatively simple.
1517000	1518000	Let's move on to the next question.
1518000	1520000	Which one is an elliptical galaxy?
1523000	1524000	Okay.
1526000	1530000	YT, do you want to answer the previous question or this one?
1535000	1536000	I think it's an elliptical galaxy.
1536000	1537000	Oh, okay.
1537000	1538000	So from Ethan...
1538000	1539000	Sorry, it's not Ethan.
1539000	1540000	What is it?
1541000	1542000	Alpha.
1542000	1543000	Okay, start.
1543000	1544000	It's 4.
1544000	1546000	Then I'm going to answer...
1546000	1547000	I don't know. 2?
1547000	1548000	I don't know.
1550000	1551000	Okay.
1551000	1552000	4 and 2.
1552000	1553000	It's probably 2.
1553000	1554000	2 has one vote.
1554000	1555000	Okay.
1555000	1557000	I have the same answer as YT.
1557000	1558000	I'm very confident now.
1558000	1560000	And Wicca also answered 2.
1560000	1561000	YT is an expert.
1561000	1562000	Okay.
1563000	1564000	Okay.
1564000	1565000	Okay.
1565000	1567000	Then we're going to announce the answer.
1567000	1569000	None of them is an elliptical galaxy.
1571000	1572000	Oh.
1572000	1573000	Yes.
1573000	1574000	Everyone can...
1574000	1577000	In fact, everyone can give a concept.
1577000	1579000	Here, 1 and 2 and 4.
1579000	1582000	You think it feels like an elliptical galaxy.
1582000	1584000	They are actually all elliptical galaxies.
1584000	1586000	So you can probably feel that
1586000	1591000	human judgment is actually a very, very inaccurate way.
1592000	1594000	Give everyone a feeling.
1595000	1596000	Okay.
1596000	1600000	So this is my other research.
1600000	1603000	I'm also doing this part more often.
1603000	1605000	I'm more interested in this part.
1605000	1607000	Excuse me, can I ask a question?
1607000	1608000	Yes.
1608000	1610000	In those questions just now,
1610000	1613000	maybe I missed something just now.
1613000	1615000	How do you know what the correct answer is?
1615000	1617000	My correct answer is...
1617000	1619000	This is a good question.
1619000	1620000	This is a good question.
1620000	1623000	So our correct answer is actually based on another astronomer.
1623000	1625000	Just the other two astronomers.
1625000	1629000	At present, it is what we think is the most accurate judgment.
1629000	1631000	Go up and give the correct answer.
1631000	1632000	But in fact, they may be wrong.
1632000	1633000	So...
1633000	1634000	Yes.
1634000	1635000	According to you, there may be...
1635000	1636000	This is actually...
1636000	1638000	Maybe 2 is really an elliptical galaxy.
1638000	1639000	We are not sure.
1639000	1641000	But according to his answer,
1641000	1643000	We think he is the correct answer.
1643000	1644000	OK, I see.
1644000	1645000	Thank you.
1645000	1646000	Yes.
1646000	1649000	1 and 2 are both a little bit tricky.
1649000	1651000	I would say it's a little bit tricky.
1651000	1654000	2, I might be more inclined to say it's an elliptical galaxy.
1654000	1655000	But...
1655000	1657000	It's just that it's really tricky to judge.
1657000	1660000	Then I actually mainly want to express a concept that is...
1660000	1666000	The decision boundary of this judgment is actually not that accurate.
1668000	1671000	And this is why I want to go...
1671000	1672000	Uh...
1672000	1673000	Uh...
1673000	1676000	Start my second part of the research.
1676000	1678000	What about this part of the research?
1678000	1679000	I...
1679000	1681000	In fact, I just want to answer this question.
1681000	1682000	That is, if...
1682000	1685000	If a machine can comprehensively see all galaxies,
1685000	1687000	How would he categorize them?
1687000	1694000	The basic idea is that I hope to use machine classification to replace the classification of human eyes.
1694000	1699000	Because now our galaxy morphology is basically based on this Hubble sequence.
1699000	1702000	This Hubble sequence has been used for more than 100 years.
1702000	1703000	It's not more than 100 years.
1703000	1704000	It's almost 100 years.
1704000	1705000	So...
1705000	1707000	It is a good time for them to change.
1707000	1710000	To revolutionize an idea.
1710000	1711000	So...
1711000	1714000	There are two parts of this problem that you have to deal with.
1714000	1718000	One is how to make the machine comprehensively see.
1718000	1723000	The second part is how to do the categorization.
1723000	1724000	What about the first part?
1724000	1725000	I...
1725000	1726000	Uh...
1726000	1727000	I thought of...
1727000	1728000	Uh...
1728000	1729000	Of course there are many different approaches.
1729000	1731000	Because in fact, apart from me,
1731000	1733000	There is another team doing it.
1733000	1734000	So...
1734000	1736000	Before I wrote this paper,
1736000	1737000	In fact, there are two other papers.
1737000	1741000	Of course, the methods we use are different.
1741000	1744000	What I choose to use here is Autoencoder.
1744000	1748000	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Autoencoder.
1748000	1753000	Autoencoder itself is a self-supervised machine learning algorithm.
1753000	1754000	So...
1754000	1759000	Self-supervised means that its input and output are actually the same data.
1759000	1761000	When you're in the training machine,
1761000	1764000	Your input and output are exactly the same thing.
1764000	1765000	The idea is to say...
1765000	1766000	Uh...
1766000	1768000	When you, for example, like this image today.
1768000	1769000	You input an image.
1769000	1771000	That goes through the convolutional layers.
1771000	1774000	You try to extract some features.
1774000	1777000	And then you can represent this input image.
1777000	1780000	And then you use these extracted latent features.
1780000	1783000	And then you want to rebuild your image.
1783000	1785000	Become your output.
1786000	1790000	Ideally, your output and your input should be better and better.
1790000	1792000	If it's well rebuilt,
1792000	1796000	That means your latent features have caught the point.
1796000	1800000	That's one of the reasons I use Autoencoder.
1800000	1803000	And then use it to do feature extraction.
1803000	1806000	Find some better features.
1806000	1808000	Next, unsupervised machine learning.
1808000	1810000	It's a representation of this picture.
1810000	1811000	It's simple.
1811000	1815000	We don't tell the machine what these images are.
1815000	1816000	We don't tell it what a dog is.
1816000	1818000	We don't tell it what a fried chicken is.
1818000	1820000	We just give it this picture.
1820000	1822000	And then you say, hey, you sort it out.
1822000	1823000	Sort it out.
1823000	1826000	So, uh, it's very obvious that you can see a little bit.
1826000	1830000	Uh, because we didn't give him any prior knowledge.
1830000	1834000	So, in fact, unsupervised machine learning often encounters a situation.
1834000	1836000	Uh, machine sorting.
1837000	1841000	We human scientists want to do is completely different.
1841000	1843000	It's just that it doesn't match at all.
1843000	1846000	So, how do you make it comprehensive?
1846000	1851000	The idea of ​​comprehension is that the concept of human beings can be more integrated.
1851000	1854000	It's more related to the science we want to do.
1854000	1856000	It's going to be a big problem.
1856000	1857000	Oh, I'm sorry.
1857000	1859000	Can I ask a more naive question?
1859000	1862000	That is to say, when you are in these pictures,
1862000	1863000	You are.
1863000	1865000	Will he do it, for example, like CNB?
1865000	1868000	Make it a fully transformed map to a post.
1868000	1869000	On the bed.
1869000	1871000	And then do it again.
1871000	1873000	Or just do it directly.
1873000	1874000	Directly to him.
1874000	1876000	Uh, for example, the mass distribution of Gauss.
1876000	1878000	And then do the analysis directly.
1878000	1880000	Do it directly and apply it to the machine learning model.
1880000	1881000	Inside.
1881000	1884000	Uh, we're just using images directly.
1884000	1887000	We don't even do the mass distribution part.
1887000	1889000	If it's an image.
1889000	1891000	Because we're doing Gauss morphology.
1891000	1893000	So, in fact, our focus is only on that.
1893000	1895000	It's like doing an analysis when you look at it with the naked eye.
1895000	1897000	We just look at the image itself.
1897000	1902000	So, I hope that the machine will capture the image.
1902000	1903000	That's it.
1903000	1905000	Oh, then I want to ask another question.
1905000	1907000	Because he might be because of your image.
1907000	1911000	For example, you might have some white noise or red noise or something.
1911000	1912000	So why not?
1912000	1916000	For example, like CNB, they also have very strong white noise.
1916000	1918000	So why don't you know?
1918000	1919000	Maybe someone did that.
1919000	1921000	The question is, would you do one?
1921000	1923000	For example, do a mapping.
1923000	1924000	Map it to another one.
1924000	1925000	A different one.
1925000	1926000	Uh, for example.
1926000	1929000	Maybe it would be better to do an analysis.
1929000	1930000	Because.
1930000	1933000	Because it's like a picture of a dog or a picture of a fried chicken.
1933000	1934000	Their white noise is also very strong.
1934000	1936000	For example, the fried chicken powder on the fried chicken.
1936000	1937000	It's a white noise.
1937000	1939000	It will affect your analysis.
1939000	1943000	So if you just do an analysis of this image, it will be more difficult.
1943000	1945000	And then it's not just doing this.
1945000	1947000	For example, it would be better.
1947000	1949000	Would anyone do that?
1949000	1951000	Uh, I haven't heard of it.
1951000	1953000	But, uh, you mentioned a pretty important point.
1953000	1955000	We actually have preprocessing.
1955000	1957000	Just get rid of the noise first.
1957000	1958000	Uh-huh.
1958000	1962000	Yeah, so getting rid of the noise is actually a pretty important step.
1962000	1965000	So all of our images have been preprocessed first.
1965000	1967000	And of course, sometimes.
1967000	1969000	Uh, for example, I just mentioned the supervised part.
1969000	1972000	I even use gradient image.
1972000	1974000	It's not just a pure linear image.
1974000	1977000	There's a lot of preprocessing processes that need to be done first.
1977000	1978000	Got it.
1978000	1979000	Thank you.
1979000	1981000	Yeah.
1981000	1983000	Okay, so, uh.
1983000	1986000	Uh, this left picture is my main pipeline.
1986000	1988000	Uh, using the pipeline.
1988000	1990000	What about the feature learning process?
1990000	1992000	I'm actually using a special autoencoder.
1992000	1995000	And then it's called VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.
1995000	1997000	And it's Google Demind.
1997000	2000000	It's an algorithm that was made a few years ago.
2001000	2004000	So the idea is, why use this?
2004000	2006000	In fact, it has a big advantage.
2006000	2008000	Uh, vector quantization.
2008000	2012000	It can speed up the entire feature learning process.
2012000	2015000	Because if there's no vector quantization.
2015000	2017000	Uh, this process.
2017000	2021000	Uh, my previous research was that I used a general autoencoder.
2021000	2023000	Convolutional autoencoder.
2023000	2026000	So it's in, uh, feature learning.
2027000	2029000	It's about 100,000 images.
2029000	2031000	And in the case of using GPU.
2031000	2033000	It takes about four to five days.
2033000	2034000	But, uh.
2034000	2037000	The use is VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.
2037000	2039000	It basically only takes a few hours.
2039000	2041000	So you can find this.
2041000	2043000	It's a very big leap.
2043000	2046000	So, uh, that's why I'm using this part of the reason.
2046000	2049000	So, uh, the process of speeding up this feature learning.
2049000	2052000	For the future, if I want to go further.
2052000	2055000	Uh, extend this research to make it.
2055000	2057000	Adapt to survey data.
2057000	2058000	It would also be more helpful.
2058000	2061000	Because the survey data itself is already very, very huge.
2061000	2064000	So if it's 100,000, it's going to take four to five days.
2064000	2066000	Then I might not be able to finish it.
2066000	2069000	And then, uh, after feature learning.
2069000	2071000	So now it's every image.
2071000	2073000	You can, uh.
2073000	2076000	Every image is represented by a set of.
2076000	2077000	Extracted features.
2077000	2078000	That's what you just said.
2078000	2079000	Lantern features.
2079000	2082000	So we're going to use this lantern feature.
2082000	2084000	To do unsupervised machine learning.
2084000	2088000	So we're going to, uh, we're going to use hierarchical clustering for this part.
2088000	2092000	So the concept of hierarchical clustering is actually quite simple.
2092000	2094000	It's every image.
2094000	2097000	Uh, at the beginning, every image is a group.
2097000	2100000	So we're just going to merge it little by little.
2100000	2104000	Uh, according to the similarity of your, uh, lantern feature.
2104000	2106000	The similarity of the row combination.
2106000	2108000	To gradually merge them.
2108000	2112000	So the advantage of using this algorithm is, uh.
2113000	2116000	A lot of, uh, machine learning clustering algorithm.
2116000	2119000	He actually needs you to guess.
2119000	2122000	Is to give a data distribution first.
2122000	2124000	For example, Gaussian distribution.
2124000	2127000	Yeah, you might need to guess in advance.
2127000	2130000	Or know in advance what some of this data is like.
2130000	2133000	How is it distributed in the feature space?
2133000	2136000	But hierarchical clustering doesn't have to do that.
2136000	2140000	So relatively speaking, there is no bias.
2141000	2144000	And then in this study, we are.
2144000	2147000	Oh, my God, I'm running out of time.
2147000	2153000	In this study, there are three very important strategies that we have proposed.
2153000	2159000	So this part is to make our eyes, uh, to make my, uh, classification skin.
2159000	2160000	It's more.
2160000	2162000	Uh, it's more sensible.
2162000	2165000	So the first part is, uh.
2165000	2169000	When we're doing feature learning.
2169000	2173000	After that, we thought about a quick clustering result.
2173000	2175000	What about this quick clustering?
2175000	2178000	We're going to divide it into two groups.
2178000	2180000	What about the idea?
2180000	2181000	Why do you do that?
2181000	2184000	The idea is to say, uh, we want us to extract it.
2184000	2185000	Features.
2185000	2188000	He can not only rebuild your input image.
2188000	2192000	At the same time, you want to capture some features.
2192000	2197000	It can be well divided into two groups on the feature space.
2197000	2199000	Groups like this, two groups.
2199000	2201000	So, uh.
2201000	2202000	What about this approach?
2202000	2206000	It's quite effective, which is to stabilize our whole algorithm.
2206000	2209000	To divide the initial two groups.
2209000	2212000	The idea is like this.
2212000	2215000	This is a simple result.
2215000	2217000	Uh, after this.
2217000	2218000	Uh.
2218000	2221000	After this design.
2221000	2222000	Uh, we're always in.
2222000	2227000	If we force our class to be divided into two groups.
2227000	2228000	What about the time?
2228000	2229000	We always get one.
2229000	2232000	It's the last feature group and the feature group.
2232000	2235000	Uh, this part is relatively easy to understand.
2235000	2237000	Because you know, they're on the back of the virus.
2237000	2238000	It's just.
2238000	2240000	How, how different you are.
2240000	2244000	So there should be less feature group and feature group.
2244000	2245000	But, uh.
2245000	2249000	After we've designed this, we've added an extra classroom.
2249000	2251000	What about the process of feature learning?
2251000	2254000	Our last feature group and feature group.
2254000	2255000	They, uh.
2255000	2256000	Visual class.
2256000	2257000	Uh.
2257000	2259000	Visual morphology.
2259000	2261000	Percentage is different.
2261000	2262000	Uh.
2262000	2263000	That's not easy to say.
2263000	2264000	Um.
2264000	2267000	It's just a different type of human eye.
2267000	2271000	The ratio in these less feature groups or feature groups.
2271000	2272000	Is stable.
2272000	2275000	And that's a pretty important thing.
2275000	2278000	Because if you don't add this classroom process.
2278000	2279000	Then he.
2279000	2281000	He might still be like this.
2281000	2283000	But there's a difference in proportion.
2283000	2286000	Then you'll find that, oh, this whole machine, it's actually.
2286000	2289000	You know, it's kind of like that.
2289000	2291000	But he's actually not very stable.
2291000	2292000	So, uh.
2292000	2295000	Involve this strategy becomes very important.
2295000	2298000	What about the second point?
2298000	2299000	Uh.
2299000	2304000	You can find the code on the line.
2304000	2306000	It's basically allowed a single cut.
2306000	2309000	Single cut means that I'm on this picture.
2309000	2310000	It's a bad one.
2310000	2312000	Horizontal straight line.
2312000	2313000	Uh.
2313000	2316000	This straight line is the class.
2316000	2317000	It's just.
2317000	2319000	It's just telling you, oh, this is my top.
2319000	2320000	So, uh.
2320000	2324000	You figure out how many clusters are how many clusters.
2324000	2326000	But there's a big problem with that.
2326000	2327000	Especially on the gas.
2327000	2329000	It's a big problem.
2329000	2330000	Uh.
2330000	2331000	That is to say, um.
2331000	2333000	If you're in.
2333000	2334000	For example.
2334000	2335000	Galaxies.
2335000	2337000	You can imagine that.
2337000	2340000	It's just that they're actually extracted.
2340000	2342000	It's not going to be much different.
2342000	2345000	It's easy to imagine because it's actually the same thing.
2345000	2347000	It looks like it's on the ground.
2347000	2349000	In fact, it doesn't look much different.
2349000	2352000	Of course, it's not going to go anywhere.
2352000	2354000	But it's not the same.
2354000	2357000	It's just that his appearance can change a lot.
2357000	2361000	For example, your spiral is in a different position.
2361000	2364000	Ah, or your spiral is closer to you.
2364000	2366000	Or is it far from you?
2366000	2368000	The whole thing is going to be a lot worse.
2368000	2370000	But they're all called Spiral Galaxy.
2370000	2375000	So, if you're only allowed to be single, you're going to have a situation.
2375000	2376000	It's you.
2376000	2380000	Your less feature group has too many unnecessary.
2380000	2381000	Uh, clusters.
2381000	2382000	But your.
2382000	2385000	Feature group may not be enough.
2385000	2386000	It's your.
2386000	2387000	Uh.
2387000	2389000	Group may not be enough.
2389000	2390000	So.
2390000	2398000	So, uh, at this point, we're going to, uh, in this study, we're going to allow it to have different.
2398000	2405000	Uh, on each line, in different branches, in this merger tree, we allow different distances.
2405000	2406000	So.
2406000	2410000	The next obvious question is where to cut.
2410000	2413000	So, where are we going to make that line?
2413000	2417000	So, here, I'm going to jump out and talk about a very important question.
2417000	2420000	It's when you're doing unsupervised machine learning.
2420000	2429000	And when you're doing gap, uh, when you're doing this research, a very basic question, a fundamental question is how many classes.
2429000	2430000	We should have.
2430000	2434000	And this is actually a question of how many classes you're going to have.
2434000	2439000	And this question is actually a tricky question in every unsupervised machine learning.
2439000	2444000	Uh, ideally, of course, you can have as many as you want.
2444000	2450000	But there's always going to be a point where you're going to find that, uh, it doesn't make any sense at all.
2450000	2452000	If you divide too much.
2452000	2456000	And I just mentioned that, uh, before I did, there were actually two other.
2456000	2458000	Paper is related to this.
2458000	2462000	So, they're in the galaxy morphology classification that they came up with.
2462000	2465000	It's about, uh, let's talk about it.
2465000	2467000	Harbour is probably divided.
2467000	2468000	You're strictly, uh.
2468000	2471000	Strictly speaking, you can say that it's divided into eight categories.
2472000	2474000	What about the paper before that?
2474000	2478000	They divided it into about 160 classifications.
2478000	2481000	So, you know, it's, uh, 160.
2481000	2486000	It's not that you can't, but you're analyzing it.
2486000	2493000	On the scientific research, you'll find that, uh, it doesn't seem to be able to find some.
2493000	2497000	Uh, similarity or do some, uh, conclude something.
2497000	2501000	So, how many classes have become very important?
2501000	2505000	Uh, what kind of numbers are correct?
2505000	2506000	What about here?
2506000	2507000	It's us.
2507000	2513000	Uh, we chose to use a very different way from the previous research.
2513000	2518000	So, our way is that we want to use, uh, the variation of gas orientation.
2518000	2520000	So, what does that mean?
2520000	2524000	Basically, you're going to find that some galaxies, especially spiral galaxies.
2524000	2527000	They actually look pretty much the same.
2527000	2530000	But they just seem to be turning an angle.
2530000	2535000	So, this kind of galaxy is what you're going to do if you're using auto-encoder.
2535000	2538000	They're just turning an angle.
2538000	2544000	But because, uh, auto-encoder is going to keep them, uh, it's going to be completely different.
2544000	2546000	So, auto-encoder.
2546000	2553000	Uh, after auto-encoder, when you're using classroom, they're going to be divided into different groups.
2553000	2555000	So, that's not the result we want.
2555000	2560000	Because if they look pretty much the same, of course, we want them to be in the same group.
2560000	2565000	So, the idea is that, uh, there's always going to be a point on your merger tree.
2565000	2570000	Because they're all based on, uh, similarity.
2570000	2573000	So, at some point, you'll find that there's a cluster.
2573000	2578000	The reason it's because of this gas orientation.
2578000	2582000	So, if we can find out where this happened.
2582000	2588000	To calculate what is distance of this gas orientation.
2588000	2591000	So, we can use this to do a distance cut.
2591000	2596000	So, this way, we can solve our first problem.
2596000	2598000	Where to cut?
2598000	2604000	So, this gas orientation can provide the place where to cut in each different branch.
2604000	2607000	And then, it can also solve a very important problem.
2607000	2610000	How many branches do we want?
2610000	2618000	So, it can provide a number of classification that doesn't behave gas orientation.
2622000	2627000	So, the final result is to give us 27 clusters.
2628000	2634000	So, this number is definitely much more reasonable than 160.
2634000	2637000	It's a little biased, in my opinion.
2637000	2641000	But I think most astronomers will agree with me.
2641000	2646000	So, 27 should be more reasonable than 160 in gas morphology.
2646000	2649000	So, I'm not going to talk too much about the details.
2649000	2657000	But we have found that they are basically based on the gas structure and gas shape.
2657000	2661000	And then there's this kind of classification.
2661000	2665000	So, this picture is a little bit more difficult to explain.
2665000	2670000	But the general concept is that we each.
2670000	2674000	So, a bar here is a group.
2674000	2676000	So, you can see that there are two groups here.
2677000	2679000	And then there are three groups here.
2679000	2681000	This is a machine-classified group.
2681000	2685000	So, the general concept here is to say.
2685000	2689000	A galaxy with a similar structure.
2689000	2692000	So, they are structurally very similar structures.
2692000	2694000	Because they are divided into the same group.
2694000	2696000	It means that they are structurally very similar.
2696000	2702000	They can be visually classified as multiple different morphology.
2702000	2705000	For example, here is the galaxy in this group.
2705000	2708000	It can be judged by your eyes.
2708000	2713000	They will be classified into either elliptical galaxies or lenticular galaxies.
2713000	2716000	So, what about the different blue parts here?
2716000	2719000	There are different fractions of bar galaxies.
2719000	2724000	The darker it is, it means that there are more bar galaxies in it.
2724000	2727000	So, we're going to show you an example today.
2727000	2736000	So, for example, in this group, there are no significant bar galaxies, bar features.
2736000	2739000	And then this is a relatively weak bar feature.
2739000	2742000	And then there's a group that has a relatively strong bar feature.
2745000	2748000	And then there's another point.
2748000	2751000	You'll find that it's pretty important.
2751000	2755000	You'll find that it's visual classification.
2756000	2766000	Like I just mentioned, galaxies with similar structures can be visually classified as multiple different galaxy morphology.
2766000	2769000	Especially, for example, lenticular galaxies.
2769000	2772000	We just mentioned that lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence.
2772000	2776000	It's between elliptical galaxies and elliptical galaxies.
2776000	2785000	So, we're going to do some analysis of lenticular galaxies in a group.
2785000	2788000	We're going to use the search index.
2788000	2793000	Basically, the smaller the number, the more likely it is to be this galaxy.
2793000	2796000	And then we mean it's more likely to be a spiral galaxy.
2796000	2799000	The larger the number, the more likely it is to be a bulge galaxy.
2799000	2802000	And then there's the elliptical galaxy.
2803000	2808000	We found that the blue one is group 27.
2808000	2813000	It's a mix of lenticular galaxies and early spirals.
2813000	2818000	The red one is a mix of elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies.
2818000	2824000	Only the yellow one is really full of lenticular galaxies.
2824000	2838000	So, you can see that in terms of structure, only very moderate structures can be called lenticular galaxies.
2838000	2848000	Most of the time, the judgment of the naked eye is that lenticular galaxies are actually all mixed up with early spirals and elliptical galaxies.
2848000	2851000	It's not that easy to tell the structure apart.
2852000	2859000	So, in the end, we're going to take the 27 clusters that we've divided up and we're going to do some physical comparison.
2859000	2866000	So, you can see that we have color, absolute magnitude, standard mass, and size, physical size.
2866000	2872000	So, you can see that there's a slight difference between each of our clusters.
2872000	2875000	It's a slight difference, but it's obvious.
2875000	2880000	It's an obvious change.
2880000	2883000	It's a gradual change.
2883000	2886000	So, here are two plots.
2886000	2892000	Basically, these two plots are the plots that we use a lot in our information analysis.
2892000	2896000	It's a color magnitude diagram and a mass size diagram.
2896000	2901000	The star part is visual classification.
2901000	2904000	We're going to do a comparison over there.
2904000	2914000	You can see that our 27 clusters are actually well distributed between different visual morphology.
2914000	2926000	It means that if you use this machine classification method, you might be able to find some missing morphology.
2926000	2929000	It actually needs to be identified.
2929000	2933000	But in visual classification, it's not that obvious.
2933000	2938000	It's just that the eyes can't be so sensitive to find out that there's actually a difference like this.
2938000	2943000	So, basically, this is the end of my talk.
2943000	2949000	We still have some continued follow-up plans for this part of the research.
2949000	2964000	My main goal is to use machine learning to build an unbiased and reproducible machine classification scheme.
2964000	2968000	It can be used by different people and different surfaces.
2968000	2971000	It can even be applied to different redshifts.
2971000	2977000	This is a pretty ambitious project.
2977000	2986000	But I think this is a way to revolutionize what we know in current gas morphology.
2986000	2990000	Because we're now relying too much on visual classification.
2990000	2997000	I think the main thing I want to share with you today is that machine learning is a growing area.
2997000	3005000	And in the astronomy world, we're mostly still focused on accuracy and efficiency.
3006000	3010000	But in fact, machine learning has more potential to be explored.
3010000	3020000	For example, here, we use machine learning to think of ways to change our concepts of astronomy.
3020000	3024000	I hope it can change some of the concepts we have about astronomy.
3024000	3027000	That's about it. Thank you.
3029000	3031000	Please turn on the microphone.
3031000	3035000	Let's give a warm round of applause to Tim for his wonderful presentation.
3040000	3042000	Let's start the Q&A.
3042000	3050000	But before we start, I'd like to ask a few questions for those of you who are in the chat.
3050000	3051000	Sorry to keep you waiting.
3051000	3057000	The first question is, which of the algorithms is better?
3058000	3061000	I think this question is a little too general.
3061000	3067000	So if you want to clarify, you can just open the microphone and say it.
3074000	3076000	If not, we'll just ask Tim to answer.
3079000	3083000	Like I said, this is a little too general.
3084000	3088000	I think it depends on your science topic.
3088000	3093000	But in terms of the last part of my presentation,
3093000	3098000	in terms of my classification scheme,
3098000	3108000	I think the algorithms I'm using are the best combination of all the algorithms I've used so far.
3108000	3113000	Because I think auto-encoder is probably the best explanation for this question.
3113000	3117000	Some people used self-organized maps in their previous research.
3117000	3121000	It's also a way to unsupervised machine learning.
3121000	3126000	But I don't think it's as effective as auto-encoder.
3126000	3132000	A lot of people want to de-rotate the galaxy orientation first.
3132000	3136000	De-rotate the galaxy so that it's all facing the same direction.
3137000	3139000	That's another algorithm.
3139000	3144000	It's also a form of auto-encoder, but it's a concept of de-rotation.
3144000	3149000	So there are actually a lot of different algorithms that can be used.
3149000	3152000	But I think the simplest is the best.
3152000	3160000	At the moment, I think this pipeline is the best combination I can think of.
3162000	3164000	Otherwise, I wouldn't use it.
3167000	3170000	I hope that answers your question.
3170000	3175000	We can chat later if there are any further comments.
3175000	3177000	We have another question.
3177000	3180000	The next question is from Altha and Herman.
3180000	3187000	They want to know if you can briefly introduce your other project, Lyman-Alpha-Forest-IgM.
3187000	3189000	Sure.
3189000	3194000	I still use supervised machine learning.
3194000	3196000	I use a convolutional network.
3196000	3198000	I have some Quasar spectra.
3198000	3204000	I try to identify Lyman-Alpha-Forest using a convolutional network.
3204000	3213000	I also predict some physical properties like current density, Doppler width, and the rate shift of these systems.
3213000	3217000	I'm currently writing a paper.
3217000	3220000	This machine has already been developed.
3221000	3223000	We use this machine.
3223000	3225000	It's a chain with mock spectra.
3225000	3231000	But it can also predict values for observation spectra.
3231000	3237000	So we're going to provide this machine with the highest data.
3237000	3241000	It's a very high resolution from Keck Observatory.
3241000	3246000	So we're going to use this part and build a catalog.
3246000	3249000	So this is another catalog paper we're writing right now.
3249000	3252000	Based on this catalog...
3252000	3254000	Because we have a lot of...
3254000	3260000	In Lyman-Alpha-Forest, there was a 2012 catalog.
3260000	3262000	So you know, it's a long time ago.
3262000	3269000	The author spent three years to analyze 15 spectra.
3269000	3273000	Now our CNN can reach the same accuracy as him.
3273000	3277000	But we only need five minutes to analyze a Quasar spectra.
3278000	3280000	So now we have a lot of data.
3280000	3285000	Because the highest data actually has hundreds of spectra.
3285000	3287000	But he could only analyze 15 at the time.
3287000	3295000	So based on this catalog, we're going to do some IGN or IGN transitional to CGM research.
3299000	3302000	Okay, I hope that's the answer.
3302000	3304000	If you want to ask further, you can continue to ask.
3304000	3306000	Then I personally have a question.
3306000	3308000	My question is this.
3308000	3313000	In addition to using your algorithm to directly put it on the real data.
3313000	3315000	Have you ever tried to put this on?
3315000	3319000	You know his underlying physics assumption simulation.
3319000	3321000	And then see what happens.
3321000	3325000	For example, the mass of dark matter is very heavy galaxy.
3325000	3328000	Will it all fall into one of your classification?
3328000	3330000	Or will dark metal fall into one of them?
3330000	3333000	That is, so you can understand that these classes.
3333000	3336000	Uh, what is the underlying physics?
3336000	3338000	Have you ever thought about doing that?
3338000	3343000	Uh, uh, actually, this is one of the projects I'm doing right now.
3343000	3345000	The direction is a little different.
3345000	3347000	Because that's what you're talking about.
3347000	3349000	It's the next step I want to do.
3349000	3353000	What we're doing right now is we're using simulations.
3353000	3357000	And then we apply this classification scheme.
3357000	3362000	And then we look at the different classifications.
3362000	3364000	Uh, different classifications.
3364000	3367000	Then he, we respect his history.
3367000	3373000	To see, to see if he has a single history.
3373000	3376000	Basically, we want to know that our classification scheme is not.
3376000	3379000	Visual classification is more physically meaningful.
3379000	3382000	That's what I'm doing right now with the simulation.
3382000	3384000	Because this part is more important.
3384000	3389000	We have to make sure that our classification can be.
3389000	3390000	Uh.
3390000	3395000	The next step is what you just mentioned.
3395000	3399000	We would like to be able to, if this part of us is confirmed.
3399000	3403000	After this part is strengthened, the next step we will want to know.
3404000	3409000	What kind of physics will influence us to form this kind of gas morphology?
3409000	3414000	Whether it's from the simulation or from the observation.
3414000	3416000	This part is going to be very interesting.
3416000	3420000	Because if we look at it from the simulation, we can see it directly.
3420000	3423000	Uh, you can see that, uh, you can understand it directly.
3423000	3426000	Study that today's gas morphology is.
3426000	3429000	According to what kind of physics process to form.
3429000	3436000	So, from the observation, you can build something like a family tree.
3436000	3438000	Of a galaxy.
3438000	3441000	This idea, or you can add you.
3441000	3445000	We have a lot of different terms, which is used to define gas.
3445000	3447000	For example, like slow rotator, or.
3447000	3448000	Uh.
3448000	3453000	Red, red, red nuggets, blue nuggets, etc.
3453000	3456000	They may actually just be because of their.
3456000	3459000	Formation history is different.
3459000	3462000	Then we hope that the machine gives a more detailed.
3462000	3467000	Classification can help to explain such a question.
3467000	3472000	Thank you.
3472000	3474000	Okay, so do you have any questions?
3474000	3477000	Uh, okay.
3477000	3478000	Can I ask a question?
3478000	3481000	Um, so I actually have two questions.
3481000	3483000	And then the first question is.
3483000	3486000	You just said that orientation.
3486000	3487000	That is, there is.
3487000	3494000	What algorithm you can look at a galaxy map and then you can know what its orientation should be.
3494000	3495000	So you can.
3495000	3499000	Just put it back in the direction you want.
3499000	3501000	And then the other question is.
3502000	3507000	Uh, you, you use the data, we use it, is the data of the multi-colour.
3507000	3508000	Go down and turn together.
3508000	3511000	Because it's just the same as the galaxy.
3511000	3513000	It should be a very strong correlation.
3513000	3516000	It feels like there's more information to use.
3516000	3520000	Uh, the first part of the question.
3520000	3523000	It's actually just the rotation.
3523000	3527000	It's a very, very difficult problem.
3528000	3530000	Simply put, you can think about it.
3530000	3533000	That's where your reference point is.
3533000	3536000	So how do you know that you're going to measure first?
3536000	3540000	Uh, where to see the orientation direction is a question mark.
3540000	3542000	And then there's your reference point.
3542000	3543000	Where is it?
3543000	3546000	So, of course, there are people in this part.
3546000	3550000	You can do it because you can actually define where it is.
3550000	3553000	You can actually define where it is.
3553000	3554000	Where is it?
3554000	3555000	Then you might use it.
3555000	3560000	It's to define where the direction of the rotation is.
3560000	3562000	You can probably do that, but.
3562000	3565000	Overall, it's just that he's still a little tricky.
3565000	3569000	So this part has always been in our.
3569000	3572000	Because there were two different studies before.
3572000	3574000	So this part is.
3574000	3577000	A lot of people want to deal with this.
3578000	3580000	But we're doing this research today.
3580000	3582000	We're doing this part of the research.
3582000	3583000	Think about it in a different direction.
3583000	3585000	He might not be a problem.
3585000	3588000	He might be able to help us make more effective decisions.
3588000	3592000	In the end, how many classes do we need to produce?
3592000	3595000	So far, he's not an ideal.
3595000	3597000	Ideal solution.
3597000	3599000	But, um.
3599000	3600000	It's him.
3600000	3602000	Anyway, the concept of this paper is.
3602000	3605000	A different way to solve the problem.
3605000	3607000	You don't have to think of it as a.
3607000	3609000	You have to solve it.
3609000	3611000	You have to have a low rotation.
3611000	3613000	You can think of it as a.
3613000	3615000	Just let you decide.
3615000	3617000	Oh, how many classes are we?
3617000	3619000	We are the most reasonable.
3619000	3623000	Is that a solution to your question?
3623000	3624000	Yeah, I get it.
3624000	3625000	Thank you.
3625000	3627000	The second part.
3627000	3629000	The second part of the question is.
3629000	3630000	The second part is.
3630000	3632000	Do you use it?
3632000	3634000	Oh.
3634000	3636000	Yeah, that's part of it.
3636000	3638000	What I'm doing right now.
3638000	3640000	Because when I was doing this project.
3640000	3642000	I'm a Ph.D. student.
3642000	3645000	I basically don't have that much.
3645000	3647000	Uh, memory or space.
3647000	3648000	You can put so much data.
3648000	3650000	So I only used it at that time.
3650000	3651000	Okay, go ahead.
3651000	3653000	Yeah.
3653000	3655000	This is a problem that is not enough.
3655000	3657000	But it is in this part.
3657000	3658000	Uh.
3658000	3661000	Multi-color is a very important point.
3661000	3663000	But multi-color processing.
3663000	3664000	He has another question.
3664000	3666000	We have encountered it so far.
3666000	3667000	Just be very careful.
3667000	3668000	One thing is.
3668000	3669000	Indeed.
3669000	3672000	Galaxy morphology is related to color.
3672000	3674000	But he is not.
3674000	3675000	Uh.
3675000	3678000	Not completely.
3678000	3679000	You know.
3679000	3680000	How to say.
3680000	3681000	To say that.
3681000	3682000	We know.
3682000	3683000	Most of.
3683000	3685000	They are passive.
3685000	3686000	They are red.
3686000	3687000	But.
3687000	3689000	There will be an exception.
3689000	3691000	The so-called exception is.
3691000	3692000	We have red.
3692000	3693000	Uh.
3693000	3694000	If you go.
3694000	3698000	That's what we're thinking about today.
3698000	3699000	To say.
3699000	3701000	Do you want to use multi-color or single color?
3701000	3703000	Because single color can actually.
3703000	3706000	Purely let you focus on the galaxy morphology.
3706000	3707000	Then you.
3707000	3708000	You can know.
3708000	3709000	If today.
3709000	3711000	Maybe there are some things.
3711000	3712000	He has some galaxy.
3712000	3714000	He's actually a tree.
3714000	3715000	But he is.
3715000	3717000	This kind of.
3717000	3718000	You.
3718000	3720000	Just look at his galaxy morphology.
3720000	3721000	You have to be accurate.
3721000	3723000	But if you involve those colors today.
3723000	3724000	Information.
3724000	3725000	Then.
3725000	3726000	You might be.
3726000	3727000	You might be.
3727000	3728000	Plus.
3728000	3729000	It's in there.
3729000	3731000	It's just that you might make us feel like.
