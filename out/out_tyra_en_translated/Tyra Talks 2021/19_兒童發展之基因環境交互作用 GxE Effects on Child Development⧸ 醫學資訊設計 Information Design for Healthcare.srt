00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone, I'm the host of today's Terra Talk, I'm Hsih-Hui-Ting.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm very happy to be here today to participate in this talk with everyone.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Our speaker today is Yao Naijia.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I personally know Naijia, and I've known her for a long time,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because Naijia is my college classmate.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Naijia's college, master's, and doctoral degrees are all in the Department of Physiotherapy at NTU.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Naijia was also the secretary-general of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She has now graduated, and is currently working as the director of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In today's talk, Naijia will mainly share two parts with us.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The first part is about her doctoral thesis,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The second part is about medical information design.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The first topic, Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
focuses on early treatment intervention,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
as well as the development of genes related to dopamine in children,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
including cognitive development, action development, and behavioral development,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
as well as the impact of parent-teacher pressure.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We will also discuss the interaction between genes and the environment.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We look forward to the future long-term development,

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and we hope to design a more personalized medical plan for these children.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The second topic is about medical information design.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
After Naijia graduated from her doctoral degree,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
she went to the industry,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
focusing on medical information design and science and technology education.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Through community platforms or activities,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
she will promote medical knowledge to the general public.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She will also share some of her experience with us.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In today's talk,

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Naijia will share common digital marketing content

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and discuss more possible developments with our guests.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Naijia will share common digital marketing content

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and discuss more possible developments with our guests.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's give Naijia a round of applause.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you, Naijia.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me share my screen.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You should be able to see it now.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think that's pretty much it.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My background is a physics teacher

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
who specializes in children's development.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in 2016.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in 2016.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd like to share two main points with you.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The first one is

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
about my PhD thesis.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
about my PhD thesis.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The first one is about my PhD thesis.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The second one is about medical information design.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'd like to share my work with you

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and see how we can share our knowledge

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and see how we can share our knowledge

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in the future.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We are an intellectual industry.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We are an intellectual industry.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'd like to make a formal apology.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'd like to make a formal apology.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My family is at home.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please forgive my crying.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll start my presentation

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in the next few minutes.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We select here oviparous and hormone-related over-time.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And we focus on early pregnancy.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In the past, differential susceptibility theory tells us that the worse the environment, the worse the performance.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The better the environment, the better the performance.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
On the contrary, people who don't have this kind of environment may not be affected by the environment.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Another theory is that there is only a negative environment that makes me perform worse.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The positive environment is not bad at all.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Another theory is that there is only a positive environment that makes me perform better.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The negative environment is not bad at all.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In this case, we hope to see the advantageous sensitivity.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This means that the better the environment, the better the performance.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This structure is divided into several areas.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
First, the environment.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We want to see if the environment affects the development of children.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Second, the pressure on the parents to have a child.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the part of the day after tomorrow.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the part of the day before tomorrow.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is the part of the gene.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In the past research,

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we have known that early birth parents will be more stressed.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In the past, the intervention program also told us that

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the intervention program can reduce the pressure on the parents.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
However, most of it is focused on the mother,

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and there is less discussion about the father and mother at the same time.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In this study, we will include the father and mother at the same time,

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and it will be a part of the long-term tracking.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In terms of children, the conclusion of the past study is inconsistent.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Some say that the effect can be delayed to 9 years old or later.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
However, some say that the intervention period is 1 or 2 years old,

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and the effect is almost the same.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In the future, there will be no effect.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So our study is also a large-scale study in Taiwan.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We want to see what effect it will have in the long-term tracking.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Especially in terms of cognition, action, and behavior.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In terms of genes,

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we chose the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
has been proven in past studies,

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
it may be related to children's development,

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
including cognition, ADHD,

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
which is related to autism and attention deficit disorder.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So there are four parts of this study.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The first is whether our medical intervention

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
has a positive impact on the development of children.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The second is whether our medical intervention

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
can help parents to reduce their stress.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The third is whether the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
can be related to the development of children.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Finally, it depends on the interaction effect of the gene environment.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In terms of research,

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we use low-fat premature babies.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This research is a bit more complicated.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It will include four studies.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So if you have any questions about our participants,

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you can discuss with me.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In terms of procedures,

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we will have a hospitalization period,

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
which is when the baby is still in the nursing room.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We will start to intervene.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After discharge,

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
there will be medical intervention in 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 months.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As a rule,

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
we will use a phone interview to care for the baby.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So this intervention will include,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
including when the baby is in the hospital,

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
as we just mentioned,

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
there will be some suggestions on feeding,

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
massaging,

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and some development stimuli.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
After discharge,

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
there will be some transfer to the hospital.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We will also teach the baby how to adjust the home environment,

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and how to interact with the baby in the future.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As we know,

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
parent-child interaction

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
has a positive impact on the development of children,

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
especially children under the age of six.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because they are basically at home.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Of course, there is also the basic child health check-up.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Basically,

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
this is what every child needs to do.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
As for the measurement,

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we use Bayley to measure the development of cognition,

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and CBCL to measure the behavior.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
As for the action,

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
we use MoveMVC.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Bayley also includes the action part.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
As for parenting stress,

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
we use PSI.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's talk about our four studies.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The first part is for the development of children.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Does our medical intervention have a positive impact on the development of children?

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The conclusion is that

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it is interesting that we use Bayley-2 and Bayley-3.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
These two are because we have been working on the case for a long time.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We used Bayley-2 when there was no Bayley-3.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When Bayley-3 was developed,

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we changed it to Bayley-3.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But what we see in Bayley-2 is

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that it has a positive impact on the cognitive behavior of children.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The biggest effect was in Bayley-4.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
However, in Bayley-3,

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
we see a significant difference.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It also happened in Bayley-4.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
On the left,

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we use a more longitudinal analysis,

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
which is also a mixed-event model.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
On the right,

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
we combine two RCTs together.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We use Bayley-2 and Bayley-4 as a forest plot.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The result tells us that

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
there may be a difference between Bayley-2 and Bayley-4.

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It may be a difference in the era.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Therefore, the normal group has improved.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In other words, our normal care has improved.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This difference will gradually disappear.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
On the other hand,

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
why do we think that our therapeutic effect

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
seems to be obvious or lasts longer?

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It may be that in some past studies,

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
their therapeutic process only lasted until the age of three.

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
However, our therapeutic effect only lasted until the age of one.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Therefore, it may extend to such a long time.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For example, at the age of nine or even older,

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
our frequency and length may not be enough.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
On the other hand,

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we may not see any therapeutic effect on behavior.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It may be because our content

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
is not as close to the part of behavioral modification

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
as some past programs.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The second part is to see

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
whether our medical research has a positive impact on parental pressure.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The result shows two interesting points.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In the case of mothers,

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the pressure of mothers has always been greater than that of fathers.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In general,

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the pressure is always greater at any point in time.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
On the other hand,

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
our therapeutic effect mainly occurs on fathers,

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but not on mothers.

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This difference can only be seen for a long time.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That is to say,

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
when children reach the age of four,

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the pressure of their fathers is significantly reduced.

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We have also done some research

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
on the relationship between parental pressure and children's behavior.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
In fact, the relationship is quite high.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That is to say,

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
if the behavior of children is worse,

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the pressure of mothers is greater.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
In addition,

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we have also done some research on

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
home activities.

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
In our program,

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
some activities are done by parents.

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Most of the executors are mothers.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In fact,

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
more than 90% of the participants are mothers.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This result is quite consistent with past research.

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That is to say,

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the pressure of mothers is basically quite high.

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The reason for this possibility is

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
interesting.

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In the previous large-scale research in Taiwan,

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
we also found that

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
most of the main caregivers are mothers.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is consistent with our research.

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In addition,

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
this past research also mentioned that

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
regardless of whether the mother is a full-time job

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or a part-time job,

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in fact,

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
most of her household chores

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
are more than that of her father.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
As for the intervention effect,

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
we see that

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the effect of the father's part is effectively reduced.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It is particularly high in the 48-month period.

257
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It may be because

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
there is a demographic effect

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that tells us

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that it is very similar to the rolling snowball effect.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It may be that

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
this good effect is getting bigger and bigger later.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So it is particularly obvious in the 48-month period.

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Another one is that

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the reduction of this part

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is actually related to

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the better child's action development.

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That is to say,

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the better the child's action development,

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the greater the degree of pressure on the father to reduce.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
As for the mother,

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
we did not see any intervention effect.

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It may be because

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
our intervention program

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
did not pay much attention

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to the mother's part.

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But in the past,

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the part that helped the mother

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
may mainly be

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the part where they have a lot of behavioral adjustments.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It tells us that

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in the future research,

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we may be able to focus more

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
on the part about mental health.

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This may help more mothers.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Another one is that

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the father and mother's performance

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
are actually quite different.

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In the past research,

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it also told us that

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
in some problem-solving strategies,

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
if the father gets more information

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
in this area,

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it can actually reduce the pressure.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mothers may need more

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
emotional support.

297
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The third one is

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to see if the gene

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is related to the child's development.

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We chose 15 SNPs.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Among these 15 SNPs,

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
there are 8 special connections.

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That is to say,

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
there are 8 red boxes on the screen.

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Basically,

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
it can be used as one of the representations.

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Because the results will be about the same.

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What we see is

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that the MLA gene

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is related to

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the preterm child's mental score.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We also chose

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
an independent copy sample.

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It can be used as a verification function.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The results are exactly the same.

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It tells us that

317
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the MLA gene is related to

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the child's cognitive development,

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
especially in premature babies.

320
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The results are the same

321
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in the learning sample

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and the replication sample.

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The results are the same

324
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
in the past.

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In the past,

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
the MLA gene was used

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in children with

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
attention deficit hyperactivity

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and autism.

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The MLA gene is used

331
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in premature babies.

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The fourth one is

333
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to see if the gene is related to

334
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the environment.

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a pity that

336
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the MLA gene is not related to

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the environment.

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The MLA gene is used in

339
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the SNP sample.

340
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The MLA gene is used in

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the VNTR sample.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The VNTR sample is used

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to see if the gene is related to

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
the environment.

345
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
For example,

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
if the gene is related to

347
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the DNA of the parent,

348
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the MLA gene is used.

349
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
However,

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
the MLA gene is not related to

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the environment.

352
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The reason is that

353
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the MLA gene is not related to

354
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the environment.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The second reason is that

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we don't use

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
GWAS or NGIS

358
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
for genetic information.

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The MLA gene is used

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to miss a lot of

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
genetic information.

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The MLA gene is used

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to miss a lot of

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
genetic information.

365
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The MLA gene is used

366
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to miss a lot of

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
genetic information.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So the conclusion is that

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the results of the

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
hopes study show

371
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
better genetic

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
identifications.

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In the parents' cases,

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the parents' effective

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
down grade of the

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
MLA gene is seen.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The MLA gene is related to

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the early-childhood development.

379
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So the MLA gene

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is related to

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the early-childhood development.

382
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you have any questions,

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
please feel free to ask.

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The second part

385
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I want to talk about is

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the medical information design.

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This part is

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
mainly because

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm working on the initiative.

390
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why did we start

391
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
this part?

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The main intention is to change.

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What do we want to change?

394
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because we often find

395
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
a lot of information

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
in the hospital or clinic

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
for the patients.

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When the patients go back,

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the family may ask

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
what the doctor

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
told you.

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The patient may tell

403
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
his family that

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
he doesn't know much about it.

405
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So we hope

406
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this kind of case

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
can be more clear

408
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
in the clinical environment

409
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
in the future.

410
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Many people in the academic world

411
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
have done a lot of research.

412
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But how do you explain

413
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
such a complex and detailed research

414
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to the general public?

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For example,

416
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
how do you let the public

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
know why you need

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
or don't need a sample?

419
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is actually a very professional question,

420
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
but the general public may not know.

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They can only say

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
don't let me get infected.

423
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is why

424
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
we want to make

425
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
such a change,

426
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
including medical education,

427
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
medical students, doctors,

428
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
clinical environment,

429
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
or preventive medicine for the general public.

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So we want to start

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
from the information design.

432
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
if you have any special ideas

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
about information design,

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
or if you already have a certain

436
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
understanding of it.

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
In our team,

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it is a multi-professional cooperation.

439
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We may have academic professionals,

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
project managers,

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
designers, and engineers.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is actually a part that needs

443
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
everyone's cooperation.

444
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sometimes when your team is discussing,

445
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you will find that the interesting situation

446
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is that the designers are not

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
professional backgrounds,

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
so when they are discussing with you,

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
they may have more interesting

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
opinions,

451
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and you may say that

452
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I still don't quite understand.

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can we think of a better way

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
together?

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So our main audience

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
will be divided into three main types.

457
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The main medical staff

458
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is the more professional part.

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It may be like what we usually

460
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
do in academic communication.

461
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like what I just said,

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
there will be more professional information

463
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
in the discussion.

464
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The medical staff will definitely

465
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
know more about their own disease.

466
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not like the general public,

467
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
who may just accept the knowledge,

468
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
scroll to Facebook to take a look,

469
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
or scroll to Instagram to take a look.

470
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But the medical staff must assume,

471
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
for example, I have cancer today,

472
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I will definitely go crazy to check

473
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the relevant knowledge of my cancer.

474
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So it will be a little deeper.

475
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The general public is basically

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you have to capture their eyes,

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
because they may not have

478
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the knowledge to know,

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
or how to attract their interest.

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's another different part.

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In our team,

482
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
we may do a lot,

483
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
including interactive animation design,

484
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
such as animation web games.

485
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will introduce it later.

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because I want to say that

487
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
we may use works to share with you,

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
which is more helpful for discussion.

489
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If it's not too commercialized,

490
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it may be more interesting

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to do it this way.

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For example,

493
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we have a great video,

494
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
which was also submitted

495
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to the conference

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
of the World Health Alliance.

497
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So the information design

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is not completely decoupled

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
from academic research.

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It can also be published.

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because of my

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
lack of knowledge,

503
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I may not be able to

504
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
share it with you.

505
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So I may not be able to

506
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
share it with you.

507
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I may not be able to

508
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
play the video,

509
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but there is a link,

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
so you can watch it later.

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll show you a simple demo.

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The picture looks like this.

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There may be animations,

514
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and there may be real shots.

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The real shots look like this.

516
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I hope you can figure out

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
how many red cards there are in the video,

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and there may be some answers

519
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
or questions at the end.

520
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think the effect will be much worse.

521
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So back to our video,

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
our production process

523
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
is basically like this.

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We may have an academic team

525
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
based on facts,

526
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
because we are basically medical professionals.

527
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The main background of these founders

528
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
are doctors,

529
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
or like me, a therapist.

530
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So we are all professionals.

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course, we don't want to

532
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
pass wrong information like an underground radio station.

533
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is our first commitment.

534
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The second commitment is to make it clear.

535
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So we hope that

536
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
even your grandma can understand it.

537
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
These are our two main commitments.

538
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then we make this kind of related video.

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
In this part of the video,

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
our process will be

541
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
what I just said.

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
First, the academic team will finish

543
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
our basic search documents,

544
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and then there will be some facts.

545
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Then it will be transformed into

546
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
an interesting line,

547
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and then we will talk about

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
how to draw the boundary,

549
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and then collaborate with the animation designer

550
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to produce the final result.

551
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
In this part,

552
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I still have a lot of works left,

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
but I want to talk about

554
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
some terms first.

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Some people may already know

556
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
these terms,

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but we can still talk about them a little bit.

558
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
For example, what is social media?

559
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because this is very important

560
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
now.

561
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Of course, everyone will think of

562
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Facebook or Instagram.

563
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But in fact, a long time ago,

564
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
in our ancient times,

565
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
there were already bad cows or PTT.

566
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In fact,

567
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
these are also so-called social media.

568
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There may be different styles

569
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and different things suitable for each social media.

570
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
For example, on PTT,

571
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it may be very suitable for reading a lot of text.

572
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
On Facebook and Instagram,

573
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
it may need some graphic support.

574
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
On Instagram,

575
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
it may be mainly based on some beautiful photos.

576
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The definition of social media

577
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is basically

578
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the technology of computer media,

579
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
which is to use a computer

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
interaction device as a base.

581
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
As long as you can use this

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to interact with the community,

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
it basically counts.

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There are a lot of social media

585
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
like this.

586
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't know how many you can recognize,

587
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
but what we are listing now

588
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
are all social media,

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
including Facebook, IG, LinkedIn,

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and even Douyin and Dcard.

591
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
In addition,

592
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when we do this,

593
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
we also have to consider our target audience.

594
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
In fact, I think

595
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it's the same when I do academic research.

596
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
If I tell my community

597
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and tell the general public,

598
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
basically what I want to do

599
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
should be a different form.

600
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Of course,

601
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
as we just quickly talked about

602
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
, I used a lot of content

603
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
when I was in Defense.

604
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What about the target audience like this?

605
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We can see that

606
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
different age groups

607
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
are using instant communication software

608
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
or social network.

609
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In fact, what everyone is familiar with is different.

610
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
For example,

611
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Facebook currently has more

612
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
slightly older age groups,

613
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and everyone is more familiar

614
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
with these two on Line.

615
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But most of you are students on Dcard.

616
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
What kind of presentation do you want to use

617
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
in front of different audiences?

618
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Another point is

619
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the part of the legal common sense.

620
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because different laws are easy to violate,

621
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
so whether it's

622
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the Intellectual Property Rights Act

623
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
or we are doing some

624
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
introduction,

625
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
will it step on the line of medical advertising

626
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
or be related to contract writing?

627
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
For example,

628
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
can we just use a picture on the Internet?

629
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In fact, this part is also mentioned

630
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
because it is especially related to

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
our academic world.

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It is said that in schools or educational institutions,

633
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you can broadcast

634
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
other people's public publications

635
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
within a reasonable range of education.

636
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In other words,

637
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
many professors

638
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
may take pictures

639
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in this book,

640
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
but they can't draw

641
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
all these pictures

642
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
by themselves.

643
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It must be explained to everyone

644
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in this way.

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
In addition,

646
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
we have a mechanism

647
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
called Creative CC.

648
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It will show six pictures

649
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
as shown here.

650
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
For example,

651
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
if you see a person in this picture,

652
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
it means that as long as you have a name,

653
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you can use

654
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
my work.

655
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
For example,

656
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
a picture or some articles

657
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in your own PowerPoint.

658
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
For example, it says NC,

659
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
non-commercial use.

660
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It means that you can only use it

661
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
if it is not for commercial purposes.

662
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Another one is also related to

663
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the academic world.

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Is it necessary to pass the teacher's

665
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
or the speaker's approval

666
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
to record in class?

667
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Basically,

668
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
it is said that it is necessary

669
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
in the Department of Economics and Finance.

670
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So if you encounter

671
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
such a problem in the academic world,

672
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
you can use it to explain.

673
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Since we have some time left,

674
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I would like to introduce

675
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
some of our past works.

676
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They may be of different forms

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and have different characteristics.

678
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
For example,

679
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Professor Chen Zhenhong

680
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
from Stanford University

681
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and Dean Lin Zhaofang

682
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
from Fudai Medical School

683
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
often have red faces

684
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
after drinking.

685
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is because

686
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
there is a deficiency of ALDH2.

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So how can we

688
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
make people understand this?

689
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We use animation

690
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to quickly introduce this to everyone.

691
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
How to measure

692
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
if you have ALDH2 deficiency?

693
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It is also introduced in the animation.

694
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
In addition,

695
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
this animation also wants to show

696
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
people in their 50s and 60s.

697
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So it actually has a Taiwanese version.

698
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because

699
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
it also wants to show

700
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
people in their 50s and 60s.

701
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So we also have an English version.

702
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That is to say,

703
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
in different age groups,

704
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
we may first adjust the language.

705
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
In addition, we may also adjust the speed of speech.

706
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
For example, the Taiwanese version

707
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
may slow it down a little bit.

708
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Because our research also found that

709
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
young people may speak faster.

710
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Older people may speak slower.

711
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
In addition,

712
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in addition to the animation

713
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
for the general public,

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
there is also an animation

715
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
for medical personnel education.

716
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It is a more professional part.

717
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like this animation,

718
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
it actually talks about

719
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
a RCT related to breathing.

720
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It is introduced in this RCT.

721
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It is the kind of feeling

722
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I just introduced my own research.

723
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That is to say,

724
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
what is his knowledge background?

725
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
How did he do it?

726
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What is his result?

727
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
In this way,

728
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the animation explains

729
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the process of giving medicine

730
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to the medical personnel.

731
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We also give medicine as a meal.

732
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In this way,

733
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
everyone can understand

734
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
why we do this whole process.

735
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
What is the preparation of the front desk?

736
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What is the last one?

737
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There is another one

738
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that is more related to the academic world.

739
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Now, in some top journals,

740
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
they sometimes publish podcasts

741
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
or video abstracts.

742
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He is a dean now.

743
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
In fact, he has made

744
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
his video abstracts

745
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
on the Goethe's journal.

746
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You can take a video

747
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and add the introduction

748
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
of PowerPoint next to it

749
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to briefly introduce

750
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
what you are doing.

751
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In fact, many new journals

752
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
like to use this way

753
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
because it can attract people's attention.

754
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I think you may be thinking

755
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
about how to make some

756
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
videos that everyone can understand.

757
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Otherwise, it is like the ivory tower

758
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
where everyone is locked inside.

759
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It is a pity

760
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because a lot of rich resources

761
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
can be shared.

762
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
In addition,

763
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
we also make websites

764
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
for ordinary people

765
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
such as the liver test room

766
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
which cooperates with the foundation.

767
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
In addition, we also make

768
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
general medical journals

769
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
in the form of comics

770
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
where we talk about

771
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
liver cancer,

772
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
which is a non-infectious disease.

773
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
However, you can't expose other people's children.

774
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We use a more dangerous way

775
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
to introduce liver cancer.

776
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We also publish

777
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
a series of

778
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
liver-cancer journals.

779
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
In addition,

780
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
there are different ways of presentation.

781
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
For example,

782
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
this liver-cancer journal

783
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
introduces a series of comics

784
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
about what happened

785
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to the main character after he grew up.

786
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The grandmother died at this time,

787
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
so she came down to the earth

788
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and became an immortal.

789
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
In addition,

790
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
there is a part about the cervical cancer.

791
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The advantage of this

792
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
liver-cancer journal

793
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is that you can give different pages

794
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to different diseases

795
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and different groups.

796
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
In this way, you can draw at any time.

797
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
If you draw,

798
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you can design the information

799
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that you want to get.

800
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Otherwise, you can't accept it.

801
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
In addition,

802
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
we also have a community platform.

803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
On this Facebook platform,

804
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the community platform is basically

805
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
all public.

806
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
There is no commercial part at all,

807
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
which means that we have no advertising income.

808
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We also refuse any commercial

809
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
introduction.

810
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
In this part,

811
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
we actually draw

812
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
a little bit of our income

813
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
to make a public response every year.

814
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
For example,

815
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
this part of the Cervical Cancer Journal,

816
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
we designed it

817
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
like a game card.

818
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We want to let everyone know

819
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
some ways to avoid cancer.

820
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
In addition,

821
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
last year,

822
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
we also designed a character named Wu Wan.

823
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He is a little boy.

824
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We use this Wu Gu Ji

825
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to let everyone know

826
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
why we can't

827
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
use alcohol to disinfect

828
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
or how to wear a mask.

829
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Why masks can prevent

830
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
us from being infected.

831
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
There is also a more complicated part

832
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
in the middle on the right.

833
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
He said why

834
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
this picture of acute lung damage

835
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is more professional for professionals to see.

836
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
In addition,

837
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
we also cooperate with the WHO

838
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to create a Vietnamese health community platform.

839
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We can make knowledge

840
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
promotion in Vietnam.

841
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
In addition,

842
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
there is a micro-hearing interactive web page.

843
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This is a cooperation between the foundation.

844
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
They want to introduce to everyone

845
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
that children may have micro-hearing.

846
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He may not really hear,

847
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but he may not hear clearly.

848
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What kind of problems

849
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
may occur if you can't hear clearly?

850
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We can take a look at this web page directly.

851
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
We made this web page.

852
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It is a small game.

853
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He can introduce the background knowledge

854
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to everyone.

855
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What is the situation of hearing loss?

856
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
What is micro-hearing loss?

857
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This micro-hearing loss

858
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
may make children

859
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
can't hear clearly,

860
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
but he can still hear a little bit.

861
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because of this problem,

862
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
they may

863
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
run around

864
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
or move their ears

865
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to one side.

866
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's not that he doesn't want to talk to you.

867
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He may want to hear more clearly.

868
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So we will

869
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
design it into different levels.

870
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He will tell you

871
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
that I have to get closer to hear other people's words.

872
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So in this game design,

873
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you have to move left and right

874
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
to receive

875
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
what these people say.

876
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The more you receive,

877
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the higher your score will be.

878
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
He must finish

879
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in this ten lines.

880
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Finally, it will be divided into score levels.

881
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
In this way,

882
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you can let everyone know that

883
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
children want to hear

884
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
what you are saying.

885
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They don't want to ignore you

886
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
or disrespect you.

887
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
He is not like this.

888
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You can let parents,

889
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
teachers and people around him know more.

890
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
When the time comes,

891
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
you can even share your score

892
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
on your social network.

893
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
For example, on Facebook.

894
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Of course, there are different levels.

895
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You can share your score

896
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
on Facebook.

897
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's go back to what we just said.

898
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Interactive games are one of them.

899
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Of course, there are many other forms of interaction.

900
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
In this game,

901
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
we want to improve

902
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
people's interest and connection.

903
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
In medical education,

904
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
there is a more professional part.

905
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's called

906
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Antibiotics Week.

907
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's for medical students and doctors.

908
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The Taiwan Institute of Infectious Diseases

909
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
has designed a series of

910
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
challenges.

911
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
There is a week's challenge.

912
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You can go up every day

913
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to answer questions.

914
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
After answering the five-day questions,

915
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
they will have a radar map

916
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to tell you the direction of your score

917
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and tell you where your ability is.

918
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In the end,

919
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
they will tell you some professional tips.

920
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
In this way,

921
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
you can learn more about

922
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the professional part.

923
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
In the end,

924
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
there will be some activities

925
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
like a small lottery

926
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
to boost your motivation.

927
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
In addition,

928
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
there is also a information chart.

929
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It shows

930
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
some bacteria

931
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
here,

932
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
medicine,

933
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and related symptoms.

934
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When you click on the mouse,

935
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it will show you

936
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the relevant information.

937
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
In the end,

938
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there are some related

939
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
activities.

940
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
These activities are not the point.

941
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The point is how to

942
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
attract people's interest

943
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and present the knowledge in different ways.

944
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's all for today.

945
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I hope

946
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
we can have more time

947
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to interact with you.

948
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This way,

949
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
we can learn more.

950
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I have a question.

951
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Do you use

952
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Intel

953
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
instead of

954
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
SNP?

955
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Do you use

956
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
DNA modification

957
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
such as

958
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
epigenetics?

959
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Do you use

960
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
SNP

961
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
instead of

962
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
SNP?

963
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you use

964
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
DNA modification

965
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
instead of

966
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
SNP?

967
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't use

968
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
DNA modification.

969
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
However,

970
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I know

971
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
epigenetics

972
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
is related to

973
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
pregnant women.

974
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
In the past,

975
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
epigenetics is related to

976
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
pregnant women.

977
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
In the past,

978
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You will be able to see this part.

979
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Recently,

980
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I have been reading

981
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
that Intel

982
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
insertion and deletion

983
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and copy number variation

984
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
affect

985
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
gene expression.

986
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Do these things

987
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
affect

988
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
similar connections?

989
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Also,

990
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
is there any other problem

991
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
with your chosen SNP?

992
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know.

993
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because,

994
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
like GWAS,

995
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
its design is for common variants.

996
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So,

997
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
in the case of low probability,

998
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
is it a good way

999
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
to use common variants?

1000
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
In fact,

1001
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
we have tested

1002
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the SNP first.

1003
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Because,

1004
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
there is a determination

1005
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that the SNP cannot be too low.

1006
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Like you said,

1007
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
if the SNP is too low,

1008
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
there is no point in testing.

1009
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But I didn't release it,

1010
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
because there is too much content.

1011
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So, there is a determination.

1012
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You just mentioned

1013
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that copy number variation

1014
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
is related.

1015
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
In the past,

1016
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
many complicated genes are related.

1017
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But,

1018
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to be frank,

1019
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
we had limited budget.

1020
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So, we could only do

1021
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
candidate genes.

1022
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We did our best to research.

1023
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
We didn't do it on

1024
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
present children.

1025
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We did it on autism

1026
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
or attention deficit disorder.

1027
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We did it in a similar way

1028
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
as you mentioned.

1029
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Another thing I want to ask is,

1030
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you chose early birth

1031
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
as the sample.

1032
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In some studies,

1033
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
early birth

1034
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
is not related to genes.

1035
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It is related

1036
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to microbiome

1037
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
or environmental impact.

1038
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Do you think

1039
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the subjects you chose

1040
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
share similar

1041
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
environmental impact?

1042
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Or they are highly variable?

1043
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It is possible.

1044
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
For example,

1045
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
we did analysis on

1046
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
sex,

1047
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
gender,

1048
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
or the education level

1049
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of parents.

1050
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
We did analysis on these.

1051
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We found that they are

1052
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
middle-high education.

1053
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Early birth

1054
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
is more likely to

1055
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
have early birth.

1056
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So, their education level is higher.

1057
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We did basic analysis

1058
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and control

1059
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
on these variables.

1060
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
In addition,

1061
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
we did research on

1062
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
genes first.

1063
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
My research sequence

1064
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is not the same as my report.

1065
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We did research on

1066
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
genes first,

1067
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but I have to admit

1068
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that in terms of

1069
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
child development,

1070
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the environmental impact

1071
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
is significant.

1072
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is the reason why

1073
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
medical intervention is needed.

1074
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Thank you.

1075
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Thank you for the discussion

1076
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and questions.

1077
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Any other questions?

1078
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I would like to add

1079
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
on the previous question.

1080
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
In the past,

1081
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
there were more

1082
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
information collected.

1083
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
For example,

1084
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
at home,

1085
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
they used

1086
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
video recording

1087
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
or tracking.

1088
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
However, there are some

1089
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
income restrictions.

1090
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Some people don't want to

1091
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
be informed.

1092
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So,

1093
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
although we know

1094
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
these factors are related,

1095
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
we can only

1096
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
collect information

1097
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
as comprehensively as possible.

1098
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There are still

1099
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
many missing points.

1100
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I think this is a problem

1101
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
for any child development research.

1102
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
However,

1103
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the good thing about the previous question

1104
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
is that it reminds us

1105
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that there are many factors

1106
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that need to be considered.

1107
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This is what I didn't mention

1108
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
in such a short time.

1109
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I want to tell you

1110
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
what the result is.

1111
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Thank you.

1112
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Any other questions?

1113
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm curious

1114
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
about the difference

1115
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
between the intervention

1116
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
in the day after tomorrow

1117
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and the interaction

1118
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
with the environment.

1119
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
In the day after tomorrow,

1120
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
we will see

1121
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
whether the medical intervention

1122
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is effective or not.

1123
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It is a simple

1124
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
intervention.

1125
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The interaction

1126
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
with the environment

1127
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
depends on the day after tomorrow

1128
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and the day after tomorrow.

1129
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
However, there are many different

1130
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
statistical models.

1131
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Some use hierarchical regression,

1132
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
some use mixed-effect model.

1133
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
In short,

1134
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
we need to see the main effect,

1135
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
i.e., the gene

1136
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and the development,

1137
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
as well as the medical intervention,

1138
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
i.e., the environment.

1139
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Then, we can put it

1140
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
into the model

1141
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to see the difference

1142
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
in the statistical model

1143
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and the complexity.

1144
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Do you want to ask this?

1145
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yes.

1146
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I have another question.

1147
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I want to ask

1148
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
how do you

1149
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
evaluate your

1150
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
web pages and

1151
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
interactive games

1152
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
are effective

1153
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and how to improve them?

1154
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We think it is good

1155
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but users

1156
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
don't like it.

1157
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
How can you

1158
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
improve it

1159
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and make it acceptable?

1160
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Many people

1161
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
ask this question.

1162
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Sometimes,

1163
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
it is hard

1164
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
to collect

1165
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
the information.

1166
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
However,

1167
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
we can tell you

1168
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
how to do it.

1169
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
First,

1170
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
if you make your own web pages,

1171
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
you can know

1172
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the traffic

1173
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and the links.

1174
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
For example,

1175
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
you connect different links

1176
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to the same website.

1177
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
For example,

1178
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I put it on my Facebook

1179
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
or my personal website.

1180
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It can detect

1181
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
which link you click.

1182
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Then, you can analyze

1183
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
the user.

1184
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Also,

1185
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
you can collect

1186
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the information.

1187
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
If you use

1188
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Facebook or

1189
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
LINE official account,

1190
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
you will have

1191
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
the information

1192
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
about the user

1193
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and the time.

1194
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Also,

1195
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
because

1196
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Facebook is

1197
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
a public service,

1198
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
we don't advertise.

1199
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
If you want to

1200
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
advertise,

1201
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
you can design

1202
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
different gender, age,

1203
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
or region.

1204
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You can try

1205
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
different results.

1206
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For example,

1207
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
if the user is different,

1208
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the result will be different.

1209
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
For example,

1210
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the number of clicks,

1211
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
the number of shares,

1212
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the number of comments.

1213
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Basically,

1214
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
you can collect the information.

1215
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
For example,

1216
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
we have a website called

1217
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Weijiao Dangzhang.

1218
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's a little bit difficult.

1219
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Most of the time,

1220
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you can only ask

1221
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
the user's opinion.

1222
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
If you want to

1223
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
collect data,

1224
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you can ask the user.

1225
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Any other questions?

1226
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We have time

1227
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
for one or two more questions.

1228
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Please go ahead.

1229
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Hi, I'm Xie Chen.

1230
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm a PhD student.

1231
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I want to ask

1232
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
a similar question.

1233
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I recently

1234
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
wrote a

1235
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
scholarship supplement.

1236
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I need to make

1237
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
a few videos

1238
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
about my research.

1239
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I want to

1240
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
ask if you have

1241
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
observed the trend

1242
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
in 2021.

1243
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Does YouTube still need

1244
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
to make 10-minute videos?

1245
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Or do you need to

1246
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
put some essence in the first 30 seconds?

1247
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Is there still this trend?

1248
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Or has it changed slightly?

1249
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
In addition,

1250
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
10 minutes is a common standard.

1251
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But if it's a video,

1252
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
they all need to

1253
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
catch up to 20 minutes.

1254
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Is there any other standard

1255
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
similar to this?

1256
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Can you share

1257
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
some tips or tips?

1258
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
In terms of science and technology,

1259
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
it's what we do more often.

1260
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
In fact,

1261
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
it's shorter.

1262
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
We usually catch 3 to 5 minutes.

1263
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Of course, if you say it will reach 20 minutes,

1264
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
it may be

1265
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
a real-time video

1266
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
or a live broadcast.

1267
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It will be longer.

1268
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Of course,

1269
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
if it's an animation,

1270
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
like we do a lot of animations,

1271
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you will find that

1272
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
animation costs a lot.

1273
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The longer you do it,

1274
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the higher the cost.

1275
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
If it's a real-time video,

1276
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can talk for a long time

1277
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and it will take a long time.

1278
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
This is the first one.

1279
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
We usually recommend science and technology

1280
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
to not exceed

1281
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
3 to 5 minutes.

1282
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
As I said,

1283
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
there is a platform analysis,

1284
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
like YouTube.

1285
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It can let you know

1286
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
how many seconds

1287
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
most people watch

1288
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
before leaving the video.

1289
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We found that

1290
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
if you don't catch

1291
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
everyone's attention

1292
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
in the first 10 seconds,

1293
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
everyone will leave the video.

1294
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
As I said,

1295
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
it's not for normal people

1296
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
who don't like the first 10 seconds.

1297
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
They think it's too hard

1298
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and they don't want to watch it.

1299
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
They can't listen to it

1300
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and leave the video.

1301
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We want to let people know

1302
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
why they need to listen to it.

1303
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Why?

1304
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It may be funny

1305
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
or informative

1306
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
or you can share it

1307
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
with your friends.

1308
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Think about

1309
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
what causes

1310
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
them to watch

1311
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
your video

1312
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
until the end.

1313
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Another tip is

1314
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to consider your audience

1315
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and try to catch

1316
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
their attention in the first 10 seconds.

1317
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
When we make

1318
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
general public videos,

1319
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
we don't know

1320
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
if you want to use real-time video

1321
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
or PowerPoint or animation.

1322
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
If you use animation,

1323
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
you can make animation.

1324
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's okay.

1325
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
In the early stage of animation,

1326
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
we tried to use pure PowerPoint

1327
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to make animation.

1328
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It's okay.

1329
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
No matter which one you use,

1330
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I want to remind you

1331
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that the dubbing

1332
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
sometimes affects

1333
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
whether people can listen to it

1334
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
or not.

1335
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's easy to be ignored.

1336
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Whether it's

1337
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
quality,

1338
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
smoothness,

1339
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
or smoothness,

1340
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
it may affect

1341
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
whether people want to

1342
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
listen to it or not.

1343
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
If you're worried

1344
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that the speech is too dry,

1345
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
sometimes you can

1346
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
add a little bit of

1347
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
background music

1348
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
that won't affect your speech

1349
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
to make it softer.

1350
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's very helpful.

1351
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Thank you.

1352
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I have a random question.

1353
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Recently,

1354
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
the rate of fan-professional

1355
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
is so low that it's hard to describe.

1356
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Do you plan to

1357
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
make a community

1358
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
or switch to another platform?

1359
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Or use the coordinate force

1360
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that they joke about now

1361
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
to open a fan page and interact with others

1362
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to attract more people?

1363
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Do you do something like that?

1364
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yes.

1365
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Whether it's Facebook

1366
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
or Google,

1367
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
it's all up to them.

1368
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's like raising a shrimp.

1369
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
In the early days,

1370
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
the algorithm wasn't that terrible.

1371
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But now, it has

1372
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
blocked the fan page to an extreme level.

1373
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
As I just said,

1374
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
some of the things

1375
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I just shared

1376
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
are more about craftsmanship.

1377
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Fan pages are also about

1378
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
business.

1379
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Basically, we don't expect

1380
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
any business feedback.

1381
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's why

1382
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
we can't put

1383
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
100% effort

1384
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
on it.

1385
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Then,

1386
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the rate of fan-professional

1387
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
will be lower.

1388
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But if it's better,

1389
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we hope that

1390
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
we can build our own website

1391
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
or app in the future.

1392
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
We don't want to be affected

1393
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
by the algorithm.

1394
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Otherwise,

1395
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you'll never know

1396
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
how to apply the algorithm.

1397
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You'll never be able to

1398
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
catch up with it.

1399
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It's also difficult

1400
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
to spread information.

1401
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But we haven't changed

1402
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
our original intention.

1403
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
We've always hoped

1404
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
to produce high-quality products.

1405
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
We believe that

1406
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
we can still survive

1407
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
as long as we can

1408
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
move the same things to our website

1409
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
or other places.

1410
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I think

1411
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
it's a good question.

1412
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We've been thinking about it.

1413
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
The algorithm is bad.

1414
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's not today's issue.

1415
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's trying to charge you for advertising.

1416
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But we're craftspeople.

1417
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We can't spend money on advertising.

1418
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's a waste.

1419
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We'd better produce better products.

1420
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think what you're doing

1421
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
is very meaningful.

1422
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I hope you can

1423
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
keep doing it.

1424
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I have no more questions.

1425
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Thank you.

1426
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We hope we can

1427
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
keep doing it.

1428
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Otherwise, many people will die.

1429
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay.

1430
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Now it's time to

1431
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
sign off.

1432
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You can leave if you have

1433
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
anything to say.

1434
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
If you have time,

1435
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
feel free to stay.

1436
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If not,

1437
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I'll stop the recording.

1438
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Thank you.
