0	10000	Welcome everyone to today's Taira Talk. Today is December 11th.
10000	15000	We are very welcome to invite today's speaker, Chen Junjia.
15000	22000	Junjia is a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam.
22000	29000	He has a Ph.D. in atoms and molecules.
29000	37000	He is currently working on a Ph.D. in light spectroscopy.
37000	48000	Junjia, if I interrupt you and ask you a question, is that okay?
48000	50000	No problem.
50000	55000	Okay, let's get started.
55000	66000	First of all, let's welcome Junjia with a round of applause.
66000	69000	Junjia, we'll give you the microphone.
69000	71000	Okay, no problem.
71000	74000	Thank you Jason. Hello everyone, I'm Chen Junjia.
74000	85000	What I'm going to talk about today is an experiment that was carried out in the experiment team of Florian Schreck in the Netherlands.
85000	92000	We carried out the first series of Bose-Einstein condensation.
92000	99000	You can think of it as the first so-called series of radio waves.
99000	107000	In today's talk, first of all, I would like to introduce our experiment team.
107000	110000	My laser pointer is my PI.
110000	114000	One of our experiments is the Atom Laser Project.
114000	125000	In addition, we also have the Molecule Cooling Experiment and the Tweezer Experiment.
125000	131000	This is my outline.
131000	136000	First of all, I would like to briefly introduce what is Bose-Einstein Condensation.
136000	139000	Why is this thing interesting?
139000	141000	Where is the interesting part?
141000	144000	And why do we want to make it a series?
144000	147000	Next, I will introduce our experiment team.
148000	159000	The two main points are that we take different experiments in our experiment method.
159000	164000	To find a way to achieve the so-called series of some cooling systems.
164000	169000	Finally, achieve a series of Bose-Einstein condensation.
169000	172000	In effect, it is a material wave laser.
172000	176000	Next, I will give some future outlook.
176000	188000	Bose-Einstein condensation is a theory proposed by Einstein based on Bose.
188000	196000	Identical bosons will undergo a phase change under very low temperature conditions.
197000	201000	In the end, you can understand it.
201000	209000	Once I have reached very low temperature conditions in the experiment.
209000	218000	All my atoms will start to behave like waves.
218000	228000	In the end, all my atoms will behave like waves.
228000	230000	It is coherent.
230000	235000	You can think of it as a material wave condition.
235000	245000	The conditions for material waves are contrasted with temperature.
245000	250000	The lower the temperature, the longer the wave length.
250000	253000	In the end, a huge material wave will form.
253000	256000	This is an animation.
256000	258000	I stole it from the Internet.
258000	262000	As you can see, in the process of cooling.
262000	268000	The uniform material wave length of a single atom is getting bigger and bigger.
268000	272000	In the end, after reaching the condition of condensation.
272000	274000	It enters the process of phase change.
274000	280000	All the condensation of the population of atoms is suddenly transferred to the ground state.
280000	283000	It is a bit like this behavior.
283000	286000	Because it is a material wave.
286000	292000	In the experiment, we can also demonstrate that two groups of material waves interfere.
292000	297000	This is an interference experiment in 1997.
297000	301000	Two groups of atoms interact or interfere.
301000	307000	You can see some interference.
307000	310000	Why is it interesting?
310000	314000	Because of the so-called huge material wave in the experiment.
314000	319000	You can think of it as the wave function written in quantum mechanics.
319000	321000	There is a group of atoms today.
321000	324000	The function is the wave function.
324000	328000	You can take this group of atoms to do simulation.
328000	339000	You can write down some interesting Hamiltonian models.
339000	345000	Then you can use BEC or Einstein's integral to simulate these models.
345000	348000	Then observe some corresponding physics.
348000	355000	There is also the use of BEC in the experiment to do the experiment of atomic interference.
356000	363000	For quantum information researchers, there is an interesting practice.
363000	366000	In the experiment, you first realize BEC.
366000	373000	Then let it do a phase change process.
373000	378000	In the optical lattice, the process of phase change.
378000	384000	You can realize single-site occupation in the optical lattice.
385000	392000	That is to say, each of the optical lattice populates an atom.
392000	394000	You can do it through BEC.
394000	400000	Of course, this is just one of the methods.
400000	403000	The conditions for reaching BEC are relative.
403000	405000	The temperature is actually quite important.
405000	412000	The reason is that you have to meet the corresponding phase space density.
412000	420000	That is to say, the density of the atomic group is almost the same as the wave length of the atom.
420000	426000	In the experiment, you have to reach a very low temperature.
426000	435000	Many substances have already formed molecules under low temperature conditions.
435000	440000	In the experiment, you have to reach it in a thin atomic gas.
440000	443000	The thin atomic gas has a corresponding atomic density.
443000	448000	The atomic density is to prevent the formation of molecules.
448000	452000	That is to say, there is a time constant of molecule decay.
452000	455000	You want to realize it in the thin gas.
455000	458000	The corresponding temperature is relatively low.
458000	466000	In the BEC experiment, the corresponding temperature is usually hundreds to tens of nano Kelvin.
467000	475000	Since the 1980s, people have been interested in BEC.
475000	484000	The first proposal is to see the state of BEC in the thin atom.
484000	488000	At first, the thin atom is more suitable for such experiments.
488000	499000	But later, other experimental teams used the method of laser cooling to form the Bose-Einstein condensation on the EA group elements.
499000	506000	In 1995, the Bose-Einstein condensation was formed on the EA group elements.
506000	510000	Gradually, many atoms also achieved Bose-Einstein condensation.
510000	523000	In 2009, our experimental team realized the Bose-Einstein condensation of the thin atom.
523000	530000	In 2013, we realized a technology called laser cooling to BEC.
530000	533000	I will introduce it in the next video.
533000	538000	Since it has the corresponding experimental difficulty, it was realized in 1995.
538000	544000	Six years later, three physicists won the Nobel Prize.
544000	549000	The interesting thing about it is that it is a material wave.
549000	557000	You can understand that it has a corresponding one-to-one relationship with the laser.
557000	563000	First of all, you can know that there is a cavity in the laser.
563000	568000	After pumping the laser light into the GaN medium in the middle,
568000	574000	a stimulated emission is generated and the light is outcoupled.
574000	578000	In fact, it corresponds to a similar physical condition in BEC.
578000	584000	My trap is an atom cavity.
584000	589000	Pumping means that I need a new atom to come in.
589000	595000	Once the density reaches the conditions of the space density I just mentioned,
595000	604000	my Bose-Einstein scattering will cause my atoms to have a tendency towards ground-state populate.
604000	611000	It is a material wave version of the equivalent laser.
611000	621000	If my laser light can be outcoupled from the cavity, it is a laser.
621000	632000	My ultimate goal is to mix this BEC material in the cavity and form a so-called atomic laser.
633000	640000	How to make this thing work with the laser light?
640000	645000	In other words, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous material wave laser.
645000	649000	All the corresponding physical mechanisms,
649000	653000	such as pumping and stimulated emission,
653000	661000	must be able to achieve a continuous mechanism in the experiment.
661000	666000	So our ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.
666000	671000	The continuous Bose-Einstein condensation is just a temporary goal.
671000	675000	But its effect is already completed.
675000	679000	If my laser light is not outcoupled from the cavity,
679000	684000	it is the continuous Bose-Einstein condensation that we have achieved so far.
684000	688000	As long as the atom is not outcoupled from the cavity,
688000	696000	our claim is that we have achieved a continuous material wave laser.
696000	701000	But we did not outcouple this material wave from the cavity.
701000	711000	The interesting thing is that the laser version has been realized in the same year.
711000	717000	But the material wave laser has not been made since it was realized in 1995.
717000	719000	What are the benefits of continuous?
719000	725000	First of all, its brightness is relatively high.
725000	735000	Because it is continuous, the divergence of the laser is relatively small.
735000	739000	This is mainly due to the continuous relationship of the laser.
739000	743000	The continuous laser light has a stable phase.
744000	746000	If you are outcoupling the laser,
746000	749000	because you are outcoupling the laser,
749000	755000	your phase may be interrupted.
755000	758000	In other words, it does not have a continuous phase.
758000	763000	However, the continuous laser light provides a stable phase.
763000	769000	Therefore, in terms of experiments, we also hope to achieve a continuous material wave laser.
770000	773000	Let's look back at the laser.
773000	779000	The first thing we need to satisfy is population inversion and stimulated emission.
779000	784000	These two physical conditions provide you a magnification plus coherence.
784000	789000	In other words, your phase is satisfied by the stimulated emission mechanism.
789000	795000	In the magnification process, your phase is copied.
795000	802000	Therefore, the phase before magnification is a coherent condition.
802000	809000	In the material wave version, the phase space density must be high enough.
809000	818000	First, I must rely on a mechanism similar to the stimulated scattering to achieve a magnification process.
819000	826000	In terms of experiments, the development process is to do the laser cooling first,
826000	831000	then do the stimulated emission cooling, and then achieve the stimulated scattering.
831000	835000	The laser cooling first provides you a high enough phase space density.
835000	838000	Then, after the stimulated emission cooling,
838000	840000	because the phase space density is high enough,
840000	855000	the laser cooling mechanism will heat up the atoms.
855000	863000	At the next stage, I will do the stimulated emission cooling to achieve the stimulated scattering.
863000	867000	In the end, all the atoms will populate the ground state to achieve the wave 33.
867000	870000	In the experiment, when doing the stimulated emission cooling,
870000	873000	we usually turn off the laser cooling,
873000	890000	so that all the atoms will not be stimulated by the near-detuned light.
890000	893000	Therefore, we turn off the laser cooling.
893000	896000	In the experiment, after the first stage of laser cooling,
896000	901000	the stimulated emission cooling will turn off the laser cooling,
901000	904000	and then further achieve the wave 33.
904000	906000	If you think about it carefully,
906000	912000	the laser cooling and the stimulated emission cooling are two things that cannot be done at the same time.
912000	919000	Because the laser cooling still has a way to stimulate the atoms,
920000	927000	so I have to do the stimulated emission cooling after the laser cooling.
927000	941000	Next, I will introduce how to achieve the wave 33 in the experiment.
941000	948000	In the experiment, there are two stages of laser cooling.
948000	953000	The first point is the laser cooling in the second stage.
953000	956000	The width of the wire is very narrow.
956000	963000	In the experiment, we can achieve the temperature of 1 microKelvin in the second stage of laser cooling.
963000	970000	We invented a mechanism called transparency.
970000	980000	We can use this transparency to prevent the atoms from seeing the laser cooling light.
980000	982000	How do we do it in the experiment?
982000	987000	First of all, after the atoms have finished the laser cooling,
987000	991000	they will be trapped in a microwave.
991000	1000000	In principle, the laser cooling light can achieve the laser cooling in the microwave.
1000000	1010000	However, the atoms can still see the laser light.
1010000	1018000	However, today I introduced a light to address the excited state
1018000	1022000	and a higher excited state.
1022000	1028000	The mechanism introduces a so-called stark shift,
1028000	1032000	which may affect the connection of the excited state.
1032000	1036000	In space, it's like letting the atoms in the middle
1036000	1041000	because of the transparency beam,
1041000	1044000	the excited state is moved.
1044000	1047000	You can imagine that there is a light in the middle,
1047000	1052000	but because the excited state has a stark shift,
1052000	1053000	it shifts far away.
1053000	1059000	In principle, the atoms in the middle can't see the light on the beam.
1059000	1064000	In the experiment, you can think about the two photos I took here.
1064000	1068000	The one in the middle is the one without the transparency beam.
1069000	1077000	I used this light to absorb the image.
1077000	1081000	In principle, the atoms can see this light,
1081000	1086000	so I can calculate the atom distribution on the corresponding equation.
1086000	1089000	Once I hit the transparency beam,
1089000	1092000	the atoms in the middle can't see this light.
1092000	1095000	When I analyze it, it can't see the light,
1095000	1096000	so it doesn't absorb my light.
1096000	1099000	So it feels like there is no atom there.
1099000	1102000	In fact, what happened was that
1102000	1104000	because of the transparency beam,
1104000	1107000	my excited state's energy shifted,
1107000	1111000	and the atoms in the middle couldn't see my light.
1111000	1113000	By doing this, we found that
1113000	1118000	we can achieve BC conditions in the experiment.
1118000	1123000	So we combined three experimental advantages.
1123000	1127000	The first advantage is that there are two stages of laser cooling.
1127000	1130000	Interestingly, the temperature of the second stage of laser cooling
1130000	1133000	can reach very low temperatures.
1133000	1139000	In the experiment, we added a very deep microscope
1139000	1142000	with a dipole trap in the middle
1142000	1147000	to increase the density in the middle to a very high level.
1147000	1150000	In the experiment, we added this transparency beam
1150000	1153000	to make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser cooling light.
1153000	1155000	In the experiment,
1155000	1160000	we added a reservoir next to it
1160000	1164000	where I can continue to do my laser cooling.
1164000	1166000	But in the middle,
1166000	1169000	I can make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.
1169000	1175000	The atoms interact with the surrounding laser cooling conditions,
1175000	1177000	so the temperature can continue to reach very low.
1177000	1179000	But in the middle,
1179000	1184000	because of the transparency beam,
1184000	1186000	the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.
1186000	1190000	They can experience the process of image transformation
1190000	1195000	without being affected by the laser cooling mechanism.
1195000	1196000	In the experiment,
1196000	1200000	we can skip the step of evaporation and cooling.
1200000	1201000	Okay, please go ahead.
1201000	1202000	Can I ask a question?
1202000	1204000	Can I go back to the page?
1204000	1206000	Okay.
1206000	1211000	Is Dimple Trick the same as the Transparent Beam?
1211000	1212000	No.
1212000	1214000	Dimple Trick is a different beam.
1214000	1216000	For example,
1216000	1221000	the wavelength is 1064 nanometers.
1221000	1225000	The high power to form this Dimple Trap
1225000	1227000	is called the dimple trap.
1227000	1230000	Dimple Trap is formed by light.
1230000	1233000	For example,
1233000	1240000	this part of the reservoir is a parallel focused light.
1240000	1245000	The dimple in the middle is focused in a vertical direction.
1245000	1254000	The dimple trap is formed in the intersection of the two.
1254000	1259000	Dimple Trap is the laser light added in a vertical direction.
1259000	1264000	The laser light makes the dimple trap deeper.
1264000	1266000	The corresponding effect is that
1266000	1271000	the density of the atom is increased in that position.
1271000	1273000	What about Transparent Beam?
1273000	1276000	I'm sorry.
1276000	1280000	What is the intersection of 1064?
1280000	1284000	It doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.
1284000	1285000	The reason is that
1285000	1287000	it doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.
1287000	1292000	Its function is not to drive a transition.
1292000	1294000	Its function is to
1294000	1296000	through this
1296000	1300000	dimple trap.
1300000	1304000	Because it doesn't correspond to any transition,
1304000	1308000	the high power is similar to the mechanism of light.
1309000	1313000	It induces the dimple trap
1313000	1317000	in the space where the laser is focused.
1317000	1320000	It induces the dimple trap
1320000	1325000	in the space where the laser is focused.
1325000	1328000	The point is that you need high power.
1328000	1331000	The laser light does not correspond to any
1331000	1334000	atoms' intersection transition.
1334000	1338000	So, in practice,
1338000	1341000	it is like a mechanism of
1341000	1346000	the dimple trap.
1346000	1348000	I see.
1348000	1352000	The reason why Transparent Beam exists is that
1352000	1355000	it corresponds to
1355000	1358000	the condition of light
1358000	1363000	from one excited state to another.
1363000	1366000	So, in practice, it can
1366000	1369000	make my original excited state
1369000	1373000	produce a star shift.
1373000	1375000	In practice, we can now
1375000	1379000	omit the phase of evaporating cooling.
1379000	1383000	Next, we need to
1383000	1387000	find a way to
1387000	1390000	produce these cooling mechanisms
1390000	1392000	simultaneously in practice.
1392000	1395000	As you can see,
1395000	1398000	my Transparent Beam looks like this.
1398000	1405000	The left side is the oven heated to 600°C.
1405000	1409000	The atoms will come out.
1409000	1411000	The first phase is Zeeman Slower.
1411000	1414000	The next phase is Blue Motte.
1414000	1416000	After Blue Motte,
1416000	1419000	the atoms will fall down
1419000	1421000	to the chamber below
1421000	1423000	to produce Red Motte.
1423000	1426000	In practice, the chamber design
1426000	1428000	looks like this.
1428000	1432000	So, all the steps of laser cooling
1432000	1434000	are essentially
1434000	1437000	realized simultaneously
1437000	1439000	in different positions in space.
1439000	1442000	So, the atoms go through
1442000	1445000	my laser cooling
1445000	1447000	using this wave length.
1447000	1450000	Then, they will go downstairs
1450000	1454000	to see the second phase of laser cooling.
1454000	1456000	So, this is the concept of the experiment.
1456000	1459000	Next, we will
1459000	1462000	make a concept map
1462000	1465000	for the experiment.
1465000	1468000	The highlight here is
1468000	1473000	the experiment chamber below.
1473000	1476000	All the laser cooling
1476000	1481000	using the narrow line width
1481000	1487000	is realized in this chamber.
1487000	1490000	In the first phase,
1490000	1493000	I can use
1493000	1498000	the wide line width laser beam
1498000	1500000	to produce 2D Motte.
1500000	1502000	The atoms will continue
1502000	1504000	to go down to the chamber below
1504000	1506000	to produce the second phase
1506000	1509000	of wide line width Motte.
1509000	1512000	After Motte,
1512000	1514000	Motte will be loaded into Dipole Trap.
1514000	1517000	Then, we will
1517000	1520000	measure the corresponding
1520000	1523000	properties of the atoms
1523000	1527000	after they are loaded into Dipole Trap.
1527000	1529000	Or their conditions.
1529000	1531000	So, in principle,
1531000	1534000	the conditions of the atoms
1534000	1538000	in Dipole Trap are very low.
1538000	1540000	The speed is also very low.
1540000	1543000	So, in principle,
1543000	1548000	the speed of the atoms
1548000	1551000	in Dipole Trap
1551000	1558000	is about 10 cm per second.
1558000	1561000	I have a question.
1561000	1562000	What is it?
1562000	1564000	It may be related to the picture you are talking about.
1564000	1567000	I just went to the last page.
1567000	1568000	I have a question.
1568000	1570000	Why is your system
1570000	1573000	physically so huge?
1573000	1576000	Is it because the distance between each station
1576000	1579000	is sufficiently separated?
1579000	1581000	Is the scale
1581000	1583000	determined by the picture
1583000	1586000	sufficient?
1586000	1587000	Good question.
1587000	1588000	First of all,
1588000	1592000	how big is the physical scale?
1592000	1593000	Of course,
1593000	1594000	the first phase is very large.
1594000	1595000	But in fact,
1595000	1597000	we want to make it smaller later.
1597000	1598000	But of course,
1598000	1600000	how far is the physical scale?
1600000	1602000	This 2D Motte,
1602000	1604000	this blue light,
1604000	1607000	because the width of the line is wide,
1607000	1608000	so in the end,
1608000	1610000	you have to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.
1610000	1613000	You can't have any
1613000	1618000	blue light conditions directly.
1618000	1621000	Because the width of the line is wide,
1621000	1625000	it actually heats your atom very effectively.
1625000	1626000	Let's put it this way.
1626000	1627000	Not only heats your atom,
1627000	1629000	but also heats your BC.
1629000	1631000	So for BC,
1631000	1634000	once there is any light,
1634000	1637000	it is in the near resonant condition
1637000	1639000	and can drive your transition,
1639000	1644000	your BC is basically excited,
1644000	1646000	and then your BC is gone.
1646000	1648000	So in practice,
1648000	1653000	we hope to achieve a continuous cooling stage.
1653000	1659000	Blue light is necessary for blue Motte,
1659000	1663000	because it effectively decelerates and cools
1663000	1667000	the atoms coming out of the atom oven.
1667000	1670000	You can think of it as a speed distribution
1670000	1673000	from 600 meters per second.
1673000	1677000	You have to go through this blue Motte,
1677000	1678000	that is to say,
1678000	1680000	make a blue Motte
1680000	1683000	to reduce it to a speed distribution
1683000	1686000	of about 6 meters per second.
1686000	1689000	Then from the speed distribution of 6 meters per second,
1689000	1693000	through another stage of Motte
1693000	1696000	to further decelerate it.
1696000	1698000	So in practice,
1698000	1701000	physically, we need to have enough space,
1701000	1704000	mainly because we want to make sure
1704000	1706000	that we finally achieve
1706000	1708000	the cooling of the BC.
1708000	1709000	In this space,
1709000	1711000	my corresponding temperature distribution
1711000	1716000	is in the tens to hundreds of nanocelvin level.
1716000	1719000	But at the beginning,
1719000	1720000	for example,
1720000	1722000	the temperature of the atomic group here
1722000	1725000	is in the one-minicelvin level.
1725000	1727000	Then the light here,
1727000	1729000	in principle,
1729000	1731000	as long as your BC is condensed,
1731000	1732000	when you see this light,
1732000	1734000	in principle, it will be activated immediately,
1734000	1737000	and your BC will be destroyed immediately.
1737000	1738000	So in practice,
1738000	1742000	our design is to ensure that
1742000	1745000	the laser cooling mechanism of the first stage
1745000	1746000	will not affect
1746000	1748000	the experimental conditions
1748000	1750000	to achieve the condensation of the BC.
1750000	1751000	So physically,
1751000	1754000	it seems that the chamber design is very large.
1754000	1758000	But this in itself is a problem of engineering.
1758000	1759000	For example,
1759000	1760000	in principle,
1760000	1764000	these attenuators and filters in the middle
1764000	1767000	are designed to reduce these scattering lights
1767000	1769000	to be able to affect
1769000	1772000	the condensation of the BC produced later.
1772000	1775000	I don't know if I have answered the question.
1775000	1776000	Yes, yes, yes.
1776000	1777000	I understand.
1777000	1778000	Thank you.
1779000	1785000	Next is the following chamber.
1785000	1787000	In principle,
1787000	1792000	after the second stage of the red mod,
1792000	1795000	we still show up in the dipole guide.
1795000	1798000	We have a deceleration mechanism.
1798000	1799000	In other words,
1799000	1801000	I just said that
1801000	1803000	I have just measured
1803000	1807000	the speed distribution of the axis in the dipole guide.
1807000	1811000	It is a speed distribution of 10 cm per second.
1811000	1814000	Then I have a deceleration mechanism.
1814000	1815000	In principle,
1815000	1819000	it also applies some physics related to the mod.
1819000	1820000	In other words,
1820000	1822000	I have a mod here.
1822000	1825000	It has a magnetic field distribution in space.
1825000	1829000	So I can use this magnetic field distribution
1829000	1831000	to do something like
1831000	1833000	Zeeman Decelerator,
1833000	1836000	a mechanism of Zeeman Slower
1836000	1840000	to do a deceleration process
1840000	1843000	corresponding to the laser cooling light.
1843000	1845000	In principle,
1845000	1847000	here you can see that
1847000	1851000	my original value is indeed decelerated.
1851000	1854000	Then,
1854000	1856000	after deceleration,
1856000	1857000	in our experiment,
1857000	1864000	we did a microscope here again.
1864000	1866000	It's a bit like
1866000	1870000	letting the atom be decelerated in the dipole guide.
1870000	1873000	It's like a turning process.
1873000	1877000	Then hide in this new microscope.
1877000	1878000	Then in this microscope,
1878000	1879000	we have to realize
1879000	1882000	and add the Transparency Beam introduced earlier.
1882000	1884000	Then I hope that
1884000	1887000	in this space,
1887000	1893000	I can realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.
1893000	1895000	Assuming that
1895000	1897000	I zoom out now.
1897000	1900000	The last microscope
1900000	1904000	looks like this in the experiment.
1904000	1908000	Here is the atom in the ground state.
1908000	1912000	Then I have a dipole
1912000	1915000	to deepen my microscope.
1915000	1917000	Let my atomic group
1917000	1920000	have a higher density here.
1920000	1922000	Then in the same position,
1922000	1924000	I have added a beam
1924000	1927000	to let my excited state
1927000	1932000	be shifted away.
1932000	1934000	So my laser cooling
1934000	1938000	only occurs around.
1938000	1940000	So the temperature of the atom here
1940000	1942000	can be very low.
1942000	1944000	But these beams
1944000	1947000	are mainly used for laser cooling
1947000	1949000	to reduce the temperature.
1949000	1950000	Then the middle part,
1950000	1953000	I want to realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.
1953000	1956000	The interaction in the middle
1956000	1959000	is basically through
1959000	1962000	my Elastic Collision
1962000	1966000	to do the heat transfer.
1966000	1967000	You can understand that
1967000	1969000	in the Reservoir part,
1969000	1971000	I try to reduce the temperature
1971000	1973000	by laser cooling.
1973000	1975000	But the light of my laser cooling
1975000	1977000	will not affect
1977000	1979000	my Bose-Einstein cluster
1979000	1982000	in the middle part.
1982000	1984000	Because in the middle atom,
1984000	1987000	I can't see the light of my laser cooling.
1987000	1990000	The heat transfer between them
1990000	1993000	is through the Elastic Collision
1993000	1997000	to do the heat transfer.
1997000	2001000	In the experiment,
2001000	2004000	the final result of all laser cooling
2004000	2007000	is to have a continuous
2007000	2013000	atom influx in the final Reservoir.
2013000	2014000	The temperature is very low,
2014000	2016000	the density is very high,
2016000	2018000	and it reaches a condition
2018000	2025000	where my phase space density is high enough.
2025000	2028000	In the middle part,
2028000	2031000	because I can't see the light of my laser cooling,
2031000	2034000	and the phase space density is high enough,
2034000	2037000	under such conditions,
2037000	2042000	I can start Bose-Enhanced Gathering.
2042000	2045000	Finally, I can achieve
2045000	2048000	a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster
2048000	2053000	in the middle part.
2056000	2058000	Now, let me tell you
2058000	2061000	that I have achieved a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster.
2061000	2062000	Of course, in the experiment,
2062000	2065000	we have to prove that it is a Bose-Einstein cluster.
2065000	2067000	Now, let me show you
2067000	2069000	what they observed in the experiment
2069000	2071000	when they first made
2071000	2074000	the Bose-Einstein cluster in 1995.
2074000	2078000	What you see now is the space distribution of the atom group.
2078000	2081000	When their temperature drops lower and lower,
2081000	2085000	you can see that the density suddenly appears in the middle.
2085000	2088000	Bose-Enhanced Scattering occurs,
2088000	2091000	resulting in Bose-Einstein clustering.
2091000	2097000	It corresponds to the sudden increase in density in the middle.
2097000	2100000	This is what they observed in the experiment.
2100000	2104000	Of course, we also tried to observe in the experiment.
2104000	2106000	I want to ask a question.
2106000	2108000	Please go ahead.
2109000	2111000	In the previous experiment,
2111000	2116000	I thought it was in the speed space.
2116000	2117000	I saw it condensate.
2117000	2120000	So, in the time and space...
2123000	2124000	You mean...
2124000	2127000	For example, these pictures are basically...
2127000	2128000	Yes.
2128000	2130000	Condensate in the speed space.
2130000	2131000	That's right.
2131000	2132000	In the speed space.
2132000	2133000	That's right.
2133000	2135000	So, actually...
2135000	2137000	You can think of it as...
2138000	2139000	In the speed space,
2139000	2142000	they did an experiment called Time-of-Flight.
2142000	2144000	In other words, if you turn off your condensate,
2144000	2146000	your atom group will start...
2146000	2147000	That is to say,
2147000	2151000	convert your speed space distribution into actual space distribution.
2151000	2153000	Then you look at the distribution of the atom group
2153000	2156000	to correspond to the original speed space distribution.
2156000	2160000	After they did the so-called Time-of-Flight,
2160000	2163000	let the atom group fly in space.
2163000	2166000	Because it doesn't have a condensate.
2166000	2168000	So, let the atom group
2168000	2171000	convert its speed space distribution
2171000	2174000	into a map out
2174000	2177000	to your space space distribution.
2177000	2180000	Convert the speed space distribution
2180000	2182000	into space space distribution.
2182000	2184000	You can see it in the experiment.
2184000	2186000	Because once you have...
2186000	2187000	That is to say,
2187000	2190000	the speed space distribution is indeed in the middle.
2190000	2193000	You have a large part of the atom group
2193000	2196000	distributed at that speed.
2196000	2198000	After converting it into space space distribution,
2198000	2199000	you can see this.
2199000	2202000	They call it Bimodal Distribution.
2202000	2205000	It's a bit like what I'm going to talk about next.
2205000	2207000	That is to say,
2207000	2210000	here you can see...
2210000	2211000	In the experiment,
2211000	2212000	at the beginning,
2212000	2213000	you can imagine that
2213000	2215000	the time has started.
2215000	2217000	Then wait for 2.2 seconds.
2217000	2220000	Then my atom group in space...
2220000	2222000	Finally, I did this Time-of-Flight.
2222000	2225000	I went to see the space distribution of my atom group.
2225000	2228000	In principle,
2228000	2231000	it meets the Boltzmann Distribution
2231000	2235000	given by some Thermal Distribution.
2235000	2237000	So, when you do fitting,
2237000	2241000	it actually meets your Gauss Distribution.
2241000	2242000	Let's put it this way.
2242000	2245000	Once you convert your speed space
2245000	2249000	through the Time-of-Flight mechanism I just mentioned,
2249000	2253000	and I'm doing 18 ms Time-of-Flight here,
2253000	2255000	and look at its speed distribution,
2255000	2259000	it does meet my Gauss Distribution.
2259000	2261000	Why is the right side higher?
2261000	2262000	It's space distribution.
2262000	2264000	Because this is position.
2264000	2267000	This is space distribution.
2267000	2269000	You turn off the laser.
2269000	2271000	Then I have a follow-up question.
2271000	2273000	For example, if you look at Time-of-Flight,
2273000	2277000	do you turn off the laser in one direction?
2277000	2279000	Or do you turn it all off?
2279000	2280000	If you turn it all off,
2280000	2282000	I guess it will diffuse
2282000	2284000	and spread to all directions.
2284000	2286000	If you look at it in one direction,
2286000	2288000	do you turn it off in one direction?
2288000	2290000	We turn it all off in the experiment.
2290000	2293000	It does diffuse in all directions in space.
2293000	2295000	But what we're looking at now
2295000	2299000	is a bit like taking a picture in space.
2299000	2303000	Of course, we do it in a certain direction.
2304000	2308000	It's a concept of a interface.
2308000	2310000	You can imagine it as
2310000	2312000	I take a picture,
2312000	2318000	and I do a point on the axis of the picture.
2318000	2323000	So it corresponds to
2323000	2329000	the speed distribution on the plane I'm looking at.
2329000	2331000	Space distribution.
2331000	2332000	Space distribution.
2332000	2333000	Because of Time-of-Flight,
2333000	2337000	it corresponds to a speed distribution.
2337000	2338000	Got it.
2338000	2340000	OK.
2340000	2341000	First of all,
2341000	2343000	when I look at it in the experiment,
2343000	2346000	my atomic group distribution looks like this.
2346000	2348000	Do you think this is Gaussian?
2348000	2349000	Actually, I have to say that
2349000	2351000	we have a landscape here.
2351000	2352000	As I just said,
2352000	2355000	the atomic group is basically
2355000	2358000	cooled in space all the way,
2358000	2360000	and then it turns around and finally enters
2360000	2362000	my final space landscape.
2362000	2364000	So here,
2364000	2367000	in principle, when we're fitting here,
2367000	2369000	let's say,
2369000	2374000	OK, I know what the space landscape looks like.
2374000	2377000	Because I know how my Dipole Trap is designed.
2377000	2379000	That is, how is the space landscape designed in space?
2379000	2383000	The atomic group's spatial distribution
2383000	2385000	is actually satisfied
2385000	2388000	under the conditions of such a space landscape.
2388000	2390000	In principle, it is a high-speed distribution.
2390000	2392000	This is what I want to say.
2392000	2394000	In today's experiment,
2394000	2396000	if I wait a little longer today,
2396000	2397000	it's a bit like saying,
2397000	2398000	when I turn it on,
2398000	2399000	at the end,
2399000	2407000	once my laser starts lacing,
2407000	2411000	I'll wait another 3.2 seconds,
2411000	2413000	and it's already lacing.
2413000	2415000	If I turn off all the lights,
2415000	2419000	and look at the spatial distribution,
2419000	2421000	the spatial distribution,
2421000	2423000	and the spatial distribution.
2423000	2425000	You can see that
2425000	2427000	it's a bit like BC's proof.
2427000	2430000	It's a bimodal distribution.
2430000	2432000	So in the first step,
2432000	2434000	I'll prove that
2434000	2437000	I've seen BC in the experiment.
2437000	2439000	Is it continuous?
2439000	2440000	In the experiment,
2440000	2442000	of course, we started doing it.
2442000	2444000	The longer I wait,
2444000	2446000	from the beginning,
2446000	2448000	0 seconds, it's gone.
2448000	2450000	Then at about 3.2 seconds,
2450000	2452000	it's almost there.
2452000	2454000	Then I waited all the way.
2454000	2455000	In principle,
2455000	2457000	the state of BC
2457000	2459000	is to continue.
2459000	2460000	In my experiment,
2460000	2462000	I measured up to 5 minutes.
2462000	2464000	That is to say, 5 minutes,
2464000	2465000	this state
2465000	2466000	has been there.
2466000	2468000	You say I can measure longer.
2468000	2469000	I can.
2469000	2471000	So in the experiment,
2471000	2472000	in principle,
2472000	2474000	we only measured up to 5 minutes.
2474000	2475000	But in principle,
2475000	2476000	this state is
2476000	2477000	that is to say,
2477000	2478000	in principle,
2478000	2479000	it has been maintained there.
2479000	2481000	It's a continuous state.
2481000	2482000	That's it.
2484000	2485000	Of course,
2485000	2486000	let's take a closer look
2486000	2487000	at the conditions of my
2487000	2489000	Boltzmann's condensation.
2489000	2490000	For example,
2490000	2491000	how much Boltzmann's condensation
2491000	2492000	did I achieve?
2492000	2493000	Here it is.
2493000	2494000	OK,
2494000	2495000	at about 3.2 seconds,
2495000	2496000	you can see that
2496000	2497000	the number of BCs
2497000	2499000	has started to increase.
2499000	2500000	Next,
2500000	2501000	we will maintain
2501000	2503000	a condition here.
2503000	2504000	Of course,
2504000	2505000	let's draw it out a little bit.
2505000	2506000	That is to say,
2506000	2508000	this is a detection
2508000	2513000	limit.
2513000	2514000	That is to say,
2514000	2515000	did I observe
2515000	2517000	my Boltzmann's condensation
2517000	2519000	above my imprecision?
2519000	2521000	In principle,
2521000	2523000	we did.
2523000	2524000	In principle,
2524000	2525000	the condition of this BC
2525000	2526000	has been maintained
2526000	2530000	here for 2 to 60 seconds.
2530000	2531000	I have a question.
2531000	2532000	Go ahead.
2532000	2533000	How did you get
2533000	2535000	the blue data
2535000	2538000	error bar?
2538000	2539000	The blue data error bar
2539000	2540000	is basically
2540000	2542000	that we measured
2542000	2544000	at least 5 times
2544000	2546000	in the same condition.
2546000	2547000	OK.
2547000	2550000	To make an error bar.
2550000	2551000	OK.
2551000	2552000	So,
2552000	2553000	the size of the error bar
2553000	2555000	is not only related to
2555000	2556000	the number of BCs,
2556000	2557000	but also related to
2557000	2558000	how many times you measured.
2558000	2559000	That's right.
2559000	2560000	OK.
2560000	2561000	So,
2561000	2562000	actually,
2562000	2563000	some numbers,
2563000	2564000	numbers,
2564000	2565000	that is,
2565000	2566000	the central value
2566000	2567000	is very close,
2567000	2568000	but the error bar is not the same size.
2568000	2569000	Is it because of the difference in this part?
2569000	2570000	Yes.
2570000	2571000	Oh,
2571000	2572000	I see.
2572000	2573000	OK.
2573000	2574000	OK.
2574000	2575000	Thank you.
2575000	2576000	OK.
2576000	2577000	Then,
2577000	2578000	let's actually look at
2578000	2579000	our BC.
2579000	2580000	Question.
2580000	2581000	Oh.
2581000	2582000	You can say it.
2582000	2583000	Look at
2583000	2584000	the previous picture.
2584000	2585000	Its
2585000	2587000	BC at a number
2587000	2589000	is up and down.
2589000	2591000	Does it have an oscillation?
2591000	2593000	Or is it already stable?
2593000	2594000	OK.
2594000	2596000	Good question.
2596000	2598000	In the experiment,
2598000	2599000	of course,
2599000	2601000	we have to say
2601000	2602000	that
2602000	2603000	our data
2603000	2605000	is not enough
2605000	2607000	to have enough confidence
2607000	2608000	to claim that
2608000	2609000	this is an
2609000	2610000	interesting
2610000	2612000	physical oscillation.
2612000	2613000	Because
2613000	2614000	it is possible
2614000	2615000	that
2615000	2616000	you don't see
2616000	2618000	a very obvious cycle
2618000	2620000	behavior.
2620000	2622000	On the other hand,
2622000	2623000	when the experiment was just done,
2623000	2625000	it was not particularly stable.
2625000	2626000	So,
2626000	2627000	the error bar is not small.
2627000	2628000	Then,
2628000	2629000	we can only say
2629000	2630000	that
2630000	2631000	we have observed
2631000	2632000	that the wave function is very clear.
2632000	2634000	It is indeed distributed
2634000	2635000	from the speed space.
2635000	2636000	That's just
2636000	2637000	that
2637000	2638000	these numbers
2638000	2639000	are from
2639000	2640000	fitting
2640000	2641000	BC
2641000	2642000	obtained
2642000	2644000	by the experiment.
2644000	2645000	So,
2645000	2646000	this fitting
2646000	2647000	is actually
2647000	2648000	how to say
2648000	2649000	In fact,
2649000	2650000	this fitting
2650000	2651000	gives
2651000	2652000	the uncertainty
2652000	2653000	is actually
2653000	2654000	not small.
2654000	2655000	In the experiment,
2655000	2656000	they are indeed
2656000	2658000	Bose-Einstein connection.
2658000	2659000	That's just that
2659000	2660000	in the
2660000	2661000	fluctuation
2661000	2662000	of shot-to-shot,
2662000	2663000	there will be
2663000	2664000	the first
2664000	2665000	stability of
2665000	2666000	the experiment itself
2666000	2667000	to what extent
2667000	2668000	plus
2668000	2669000	my fitting
2669000	2670000	corresponds to
2670000	2671000	this
2671000	2672000	uncertainty.
2672000	2673000	So,
2673000	2674000	it will give
2674000	2675000	what Yan-Yong just said.
2675000	2676000	My error bar
2676000	2677000	is actually
2677000	2678000	is
2678000	2679000	we
2679000	2680000	give a reasonable
2680000	2681000	error bar.
2681000	2682000	That
2682000	2683000	but that is to say
2683000	2684000	BC's
2684000	2685000	feature
2685000	2686000	is
2686000	2687000	there
2687000	2688000	is
2688000	2689000	exist.
2689000	2690000	So,
2690000	2691000	BC
2691000	2692000	this thing
2692000	2693000	is confirmed.
2693000	2694000	But that is to say
2694000	2695000	the number part
2695000	2696000	we are now
2696000	2697000	our experiment
2697000	2698000	above
2698000	2699000	the
2699000	2700000	stability
2700000	2701000	is not enough
2701000	2702000	for us to
2702000	2703000	claim that
2703000	2704000	we have seen
2704000	2705000	any
2705000	2706000	effective oscillation.
2706000	2707000	But
2707000	2708000	oscillation
2708000	2709000	is actually
2709000	2710000	interesting.
2710000	2711000	Because
2711000	2712000	laser itself
2712000	2713000	is
2713000	2714000	because
2714000	2715000	your analogy
2715000	2716000	just now
2716000	2717000	I really like
2717000	2718000	the
2718000	2719000	laser and
2719000	2720000	the
2720000	2721000	matter wave
2721000	2722000	to compare
2722000	2723000	that
2723000	2724000	is
2724000	2725000	we also know
2725000	2726000	that
2726000	2727000	CW laser
2727000	2728000	if you
2728000	2729000	design
2729000	2730000	oscillation
2730000	2731000	I just want to ask
2731000	2732000	that is
2732000	2733000	in this
2733000	2734000	in your system
2734000	2735000	there may be
2735000	2736000	similar mechanism?
2736000	2737000	Yes.
2737000	2738000	There will be.
2738000	2739000	In fact, there is paper
2739000	2740000	also written.
2740000	2741000	In fact,
2741000	2742000	we also want to
2742000	2743000	try to measure it.
2743000	2744000	Because
2744000	2745000	that is to say
2745000	2746000	just like you said
2746000	2747000	that is to say
2747000	2748000	this is a
2748000	2749000	with laser
2749000	2750000	some
2750000	2751000	comparative
2751000	2752000	physical system.
2752000	2753000	In fact,
2753000	2754000	the difference
2754000	2755000	is only
2755000	2756000	my origin
2756000	2757000	is quality.
2757000	2758000	My light
2758000	2759000	but
2759000	2760000	they themselves
2760000	2761000	follow some
2761000	2762000	laser
2762000	2763000	some
2763000	2764000	type of
2764000	2765000	mechanism.
2765000	2766000	So
2766000	2767000	you talk about those
2767000	2768000	oscillation
2768000	2769000	or
2769000	2770000	relaxation
2770000	2771000	that is to say
2771000	2772000	will
2772000	2773000	we expect
2773000	2774000	in
2774000	2775000	this
2775000	2776000	system
2776000	2777000	there is a way
2777000	2778000	to observe
2778000	2779000	but we
2779000	2780000	have this idea
2780000	2781000	want to go
2781000	2782000	measure
2782000	2783000	no data
2783000	2784000	have not measured
2784000	2785000	can only say
2785000	2786000	no
2787000	2788000	that
2788000	2789000	ok
2789000	2790000	that
2790000	2791000	on the experiment
2791000	2792000	I am now
2792000	2793000	to correspond to some
2793000	2794000	data after fitting
2794000	2795000	on the experiment
2795000	2796000	we achieved
2796000	2797000	almost
2797000	2798000	in such a
2798000	2799000	continuous

2801000	2802000	laser
2802000	2803000	experiment
2803000	2804000	system
2804000	2805000	we have a way
2805000	2806000	to produce
2806000	2807000	every second
2812000	2813000	loading rate
2813000	2814000	I did not give
2814000	2815000	but
2815000	2816000	in fact
2816000	2817000	in
2817000	2818000	once
2818000	2819000	into
2819000	2820000	stable
2820000	2821000	stable conditions
2821000	2822000	after
2822000	2823000	my
2823000	2824000	Bose-Einstein connection
2824000	2825000	is almost
2825000	2826000	in this
2826000	2827000	number
2827000	2828000	7 x 10
2828000	2829000	3
2829000	2830000	7000
2830000	2831000	and
2831000	2832000	then
2832000	2833000	around
2833000	2834000	the
2834000	2835000	origin
2835000	2836000	for example
2836000	2837000	around
2837000	2838000	the reservoir
2838000	2839000	part
2839000	2840000	almost
2840000	2841000	the number
2841000	2842000	is in
2842000	2843000	700
2843000	2844000	K
2844000	2845000	when
2845000	2846000	Jason
2846000	2847000	said
2847000	2848000	we
2848000	2849000	want to see
2849000	2850000	some
2850000	2851000	for example
2851000	2852000	BEC
2852000	2853000	his
2853000	2854000	oscillation
2854000	2855000	behavior
2855000	2856000	because these
2856000	2857000	correspond to
2857000	2858000	the
2858000	2859000	laser-related
2859000	2860000	some
2860000	2861000	physical
2861000	2862000	mechanism
2862000	2863000	that
2863000	2864000	we hope
2864000	2865000	to be in the
2865000	2866000	experiment system
2866000	2867000	in the
2867000	2868000	BEC
2868000	2869000	we now
2869000	2870000	do it
2870000	2871000	to see
2871000	2872000	similar behavior
2872000	2873000	because
2873000	2874000	we can
2874000	2875000	explain
2875000	2876000	our
2876000	2877000	data
2877000	2878000	why
2878000	2879000	there seems to be
2879000	2880000	some
2880000	2881000	oscillation
2881000	2882000	behavior
2882000	2883000	like
2883000	2884000	I just
2884000	2885000	said
2885000	2886000	the stability of
2886000	2887000	our experiment
2887000	2888000	is not enough
2888000	2889000	to make us
2889000	2890000	say
2890000	2891000	that
2891000	2892000	this
2892000	2893000	corresponds
2893000	2894000	to
2894000	2895000	the
2895000	2896000	oscillation
2896000	2897000	claimed
2897000	2898000	by
2898000	2899000	the
2899000	2900000	laser
2900000	2901000	but
2901000	2902000	theoretically
2902000	2903000	now
2903000	2904000	we are
2904000	2905000	also
2905000	2906000	interested in
2906000	2907000	trying to
2907000	2908000	measure it
2908000	2909000	here
2909000	2910000	is a
2910000	2911000	from
2911000	2912000	the
2912000	2913000	original
2913000	2914000	1980s
2914000	2915000	we
2915000	2916000	really
2916000	2917000	started
2917000	2918000	to find
2918000	2919000	BEC
2919000	2920000	in hydrogen
2920000	2921000	in the
2921000	2922000	original
2922000	2923000	19 years
2923000	2924000	we
2924000	2925000	even
2925000	2926000	tried to
2926000	2927000	make
2927000	2928000	so-called
2928000	2929000	continuous
2929000	2930000	Bose-Einstein
2930000	2931000	connection
2931000	2932000	to produce
2932000	2933000	this
2933000	2934000	very low-temperature
2934000	2935000	atomic
2935000	2936000	beam
2936000	2937000	like this
2937000	2938000	and it
2938000	2939000	so-called
2939000	2940000	in the dark
2940000	2941000	means that
2941000	2942000	it is in
2942000	2943000	my
2943000	2944000	microscope
2944000	2945000	guide
2945000	2946000	that is
2946000	2947000	in a
2947000	2948000	dipole
2948000	2949000	guide
2949000	2950000	microscope
2950000	2951000	and
2951000	2952000	it
2952000	2953000	around
2953000	2954000	there is
2954000	2955000	no
2955000	2956000	near-resonant
2956000	2957000	light
2957000	2958000	that is
2958000	2959000	there is
2959000	2960000	almost
2960000	2961000	no
2961000	2962000	laser light
2962000	2963000	to heat it
2963000	2964000	to very hot
2964000	2965000	so that
2965000	2966000	the experiment is that
2966000	2967000	I am satisfied with the
2967000	2968000	experiment system
2968000	2969000	to achieve a
2969000	2970000	very cold
2970000	2971000	atomic number
2971000	2972000	like this
2972000	2973000	that
2973000	2974000	experiment
2974000	2975000	we of course
2975000	2976000	also achieved
2976000	2977000	continuous
2977000	2978000	Bose-Einstein
2978000	2979000	connection
2979000	2980000	that
2980000	2981000	next
2981000	2982000	to do
2982000	2983000	what research
2983000	2984000	is interesting
2984000	2985000	that of course
2985000	2986000	for example
2986000	2987000	continuous
2987000	2988000	super-cold
2988000	2989000	atomic number
2989000	2990000	is very interesting
2990000	2991000	that is
2991000	2992000	you put this
2992000	2993000	very cold
2993000	2994000	atomic number
2994000	2995000	through a
2995000	2996000	cavity
2996000	2997000	when
2997000	2998000	you may
2998000	2999000	let the atom
2999000	3000000	in the cavity
3000000	3001000	it has this
3001000	3002000	we call
3002000	3003000	collective
3003000	3004000	emission
3004000	3005000	of
3005000	3006000	behavior
3006000	3007000	that is
3007000	3008000	it
3008000	3009000	that
3009000	3010000	private atom
3010000	3011000	it is actually
3011000	3012000	the first stage of
3012000	3013000	light
3013000	3014000	in fact
3014000	3015000	one of the
3015000	3016000	candidates
3016000	3017000	that it
3017000	3018000	has a
3018000	3019000	very low
3019000	3020000	emission rate
3020000	3021000	that
3021000	3022000	can be used
3022000	3023000	to define
3023000	3024000	the time
3024000	3025000	in this
3025000	3026000	experiment
3026000	3027000	mechanism
3027000	3028000	or
3028000	3029000	in this
3029000	3030000	experiment
3030000	3031000	we hope
3031000	3032000	to take this
3032000	3033000	very cold
3033000	3034000	atomic number
3034000	3035000	through a
3035000	3036000	cavity
3036000	3037000	after
3037000	3038000	the
3038000	3039000	cavity
3039000	3040000	direction
3040000	3041000	to
3041000	3042000	have some
3042000	3043000	collective
3043000	3044000	that is
3044000	3045000	it has
3045000	3046000	some
3046000	3047000	corresponding
3047000	3048000	effect
3048000	3049000	and
3049000	3050000	then
3050000	3051000	in this
3051000	3052000	very
3052000	3053000	narrow
3053000	3054000	light
3054000	3055000	very
3055000	3056000	narrow
3056000	3057000	emission rate
3057000	3058000	to
3058000	3059000	do
3059000	3060000	emission
3060000	3061000	and
3061000	3062000	in principle
3062000	3063000	it can be
3063000	3064000	a very
3064000	3065000	accurate
3065000	3066000	light
3066000	3067000	that is
3067000	3068000	or
3068000	3069000	very
3069000	3070000	accurate
3070000	3071000	laser
3071000	3072000	because it is
3072000	3073000	directly from the
3073000	3074000	atomic number
3074000	3075000	itself
3075000	3076000	and then
3076000	3077000	it can
3077000	3078000	be
3078000	3079000	a new
3079000	3080000	technology of
3080000	3081000	light
3081000	3082000	that
3082000	3083000	on the other hand
3083000	3084000	of course
3084000	3085000	we have now realized
3085000	3086000	continuous wave
3086000	3087000	of course
3087000	3088000	we want to
3088000	3089000	further
3089000	3090000	put the
3090000	3091000	atomic number
3091000	3092000	from this
3092000	3093000	cavity
3093000	3094000	inside
3094000	3095000	cover out
3095000	3096000	that we
3096000	3097000	can be
3097000	3098000	called
3098000	3099000	we realized
3099000	3100000	true
3100000	3101000	continuous
3101000	3102000	atomic
3102000	3103000	laser
3103000	3104000	because
3104000	3105000	now
3105000	3106000	but today
3106000	3107000	I want to do
3107000	3108000	is that
3108000	3109000	there is a
3109000	3110000	mechanism
3110000	3111000	is also put
3111000	3112000	these atoms
3112000	3113000	from the
3113000	3114000	cavity inside
3114000	3115000	cover out
3115000	3116000	after
3116000	3117000	the realization
3117000	3118000	of this
3118000	3119000	atomic
3119000	3120000	laser
3120000	3121000	that
3121000	3122000	just
3122000	3123000	Jason
3123000	3124000	also talked
3124000	3125000	about
3125000	3126000	is that
3126000	3127000	the new
3127000	3128000	matter
3128000	3129000	wave
3129000	3130000	it
3130000	3131000	in principle
3131000	3132000	we have a
3132000	3133000	lot of
3133000	3134000	things
3134000	3135000	that we
3135000	3136000	can measure
3136000	3137000	the
3137000	3138000	gain dynamics
3138000	3139000	look like
3139000	3140000	its
3140000	3141000	oscillation
3141000	3142000	behavior
3142000	3143000	we have
3143000	3144000	no way to
3144000	3145000	measure
3145000	3146000	these
3146000	3147000	heat balance
3147000	3148000	heat imbalance
3148000	3149000	that is
3149000	3150000	non-equilibrium
3150000	3151000	some
3151000	3152000	corresponding
3152000	3153000	laser
3153000	3154000	physics
3154000	3155000	we also
3155000	3156000	hope to
3156000	3157000	observe
3157000	3158000	in this
3158000	3159000	experiment
3159000	3160000	to see
3160000	3161000	that another
3161000	3162000	course
3162000	3163000	is that
3163000	3164000	actually
3164000	3165000	new
3165000	3166000	for example
3166000	3167000	tweezers
3167000	3168000	atomic array
3168000	3169000	qubit
3169000	3170000	they
3170000	3171000	for example
3171000	3172000	this new
3172000	3173000	paper
3173000	3174000	they
3174000	3175000	say
3175000	3176000	they can
3176000	3177000	tweezers
3177000	3178000	inside
3178000	3179000	to realize
3179000	3180000	in one
3180000	3181000	of the
3181000	3182000	positions
3182000	3183000	to do
3183000	3184000	qubit
3184000	3185000	register
3185000	3186000	preparation
3186000	3187000	then
3187000	3188000	they
3188000	3189000	these
3189000	3190000	qubit

3263000	3264000	thank
3264000	3265000	you
3265000	3266000	let's
3266000	3267000	applaud
3267000	3268000	now
3268000	3269000	if
3269000	3270000	you have
3270000	3271000	any
3271000	3272000	questions
3272000	3273000	please
3273000	3274000	ask
3274000	3275000	I
3275000	3276000	have
3276000	3277000	a
3277000	3278000	question
3278000	3279000	that
3279000	3280000	if
3280000	3281000	you can
3281000	3282000	make the
3282000	3283000	system
3283000	3284000	smaller
3284000	3285000	do you
3285000	3286000	think
3286000	3287000	there is
3287000	3288000	a limit
3288000	3289000	that
3289000	3290000	you can't
3290000	3291000	make it
3291000	3292000	smaller
3292000	3293000	like
3293000	3294000	it can't
3294000	3295000	be smaller
3295000	3296000	than
3296000	3297000	some
3297000	3298000	absolute
3298000	3299000	scale
3299000	3300000	so it
3300000	3301000	is this
3301000	3302000	small
3302000	3303000	or
3303000	3304000	do you
3304000	3305000	think
3305000	3306000	there is
3306000	3307000	no
3307000	3308000	limit
3308000	3309000	if
3309000	3310000	it
3310000	3311000	is
3311000	3312000	small
3312000	3313000	I
3313000	3314000	think
3314000	3315000	iphone is
3315000	3316000	the limit
3316000	3317000	but
3317000	3318000	this is a
3318000	3319000	very big
3319000	3320000	limit
3320000	3321000	that is
3321000	3322000	the size
3322000	3323000	of the
3323000	3324000	iphone
3324000	3325000	the
3325000	3326000	main
3326000	3327000	reason is
3327000	3328000	because
3328000	3329000	some
3329000	3330000	physical
3330000	3331000	restrictions
3331000	3332000	such as
3332000	3333000	how good
3333000	3334000	my
3334000	3335000	experiment
3335000	3336000	is
3336000	3337000	to
3337000	3338000	produce
3338000	3339000	these
3339000	3340000	atoms
3340000	3341000	and then
3341000	3342000	do further
3342000	3343000	laser cooling
3343000	3344000	this
3344000	3345000	oven
3345000	3346000	depends on
3346000	3347000	the
3347000	3348000	atom steam
3348000	3349000	so you
3349000	3350000	actually have
3350000	3351000	to heat
3351000	3352000	your
3352000	3353000	atom
3353000	3354000	for
3354000	3355000	the
3355000	3356000	private
3356000	3357000	atom
3357000	3358000	,
3358000	3359000	its
3359000	3360000	heating
3360000	3361000	temperature
3361000	3362000	is actually
3362000	3363000	quite high
3363000	3364000	to 600
3364000	3365000	K
3365000	3366000	so
3366000	3367000	the
3367000	3368000	different
3368000	3369000	laser
3369000	3370000	cooling
3370000	3371000	corresponding

3373000	3374000	laser
3374000	3375000	width
3375000	3376000	gives you
3376000	3377000	different
3377000	3378000	temperature
3378000	3379000	conditions
3379000	3380000	so
3380000	3381000	you can
3381000	3382000	achieve
3382000	3383000	this
3383000	3384000	different
3384000	3385000	phase
3385000	3386000	of a

3396000	3397000	don't
