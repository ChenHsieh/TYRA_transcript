1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you all for attending this lecture.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I am a PhD student at the University of Belize.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am very happy to be able to host this lecture for Project TIRA.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
From seeing people from satellites, urban transformation, moving and mental health,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
applying remote data and machine learning cross-field research.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TIRA is a PhD student from various fields in Taiwan,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
an organization made up of PhD students, post-doctorate researchers and assistant professors.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We hope to connect young researchers from different fields.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today's speaker, Chi-Hsing, we met in the first English class.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We belong to different fields of science and technology.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Recently, because of this lecture, we are in contact again.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think this is the purpose of Project TIRA.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To connect scholars from different fields.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Chi-Hsing just got his doctorate from the Department of Environmental Science at the University of Austria.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He is currently a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When he was a post-doctoral student,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
he conducted research on typhoons in Taiwan and the Philippines.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
During his post-doctoral studies, he also conducted research in the United States.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
His current post-doctoral research project is mainly in the Himalayas.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the next two years, he will receive the Yale Gallaudet Donnelly Fellowship.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He is expected to travel from Africa to the world.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Chi-Hsing will give a lecture for about an hour.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
After that, there will be a Q&A time.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't have much to say about Chi-Hsing, so I'll give you the time.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you, everyone.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Today, I will divide this lecture into two parts.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The first part is about how we can use satellite imagery and machine learning to detect loss.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The second part will focus on the relationship between loss and mental health in Denmark.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Before we start, I'd like to take a short break.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please let me know if the connection is bad.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
At the beginning, I'd like to talk about my research theme from a view that you may be familiar with.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In this photo of Taipei City, if you can see my mouse,

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
this road here, the road under the building, what is it like?

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In the north of Zhongshuo East Road,

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you can imagine that this area is more like an apartment building.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The density of the street is higher, and the width of the street is narrower.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In the south of Zhongshuo East Road, the business district,

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we can see that the construction rate is much lower.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There is a lot of space between the buildings.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
At the same time, it is not a low-density form.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you look at it from a vertical perspective, it has a lot of skyscrapers.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In the past, many urban planners and environmental scientists

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
have been thinking about what kind of urban form is the best or the most sustainable.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In terms of sustainability, there are two aspects that have often been discussed in the past.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The first is how to make urban planning reach the goal of carbon reduction under the climate change.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, if today's land use configuration can make the workplace and residences close enough,

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
so that people don't have to travel a long distance when they're on vacation,

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
this can achieve the effect of carbon reduction.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The second aspect of the study is to regard the city as a separate system for land use.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In addition to the city, there are usually rural areas or natural protected areas.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
For environmental scientists and eco-scientists,

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
if we can make the city's land use appear in a very limited space range and efficiently expand to other places,

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
then we can save more land for agriculture or other crops.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My interest in the study is a little different from the two aspects of the city as another aspect of the environment.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What I'm interested in is the part about people.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When we talk about sustainability, it's not about the sustainability of the environment,

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but it's about people and the environment.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
People themselves have to be able to live in this place in a sustainable way.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm very lucky to work on this project during my Ph.D. period.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The main theme of the project is psychological health.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I also had the opportunity to start working on this project.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'd like to give you a data on psychological health.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In the past ten years,

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the World Health Organization has conducted a survey of various countries around the world.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It can be found that an average of four people in the world

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
will have a certain stage in their life when they are affected by any psychological disease.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is only the population that has been recorded due to old age.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In fact, the number will be higher.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Psychological health has many social factors.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is the relationship between the building environment and psychological health?

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can think of it in three directions.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The first one is that we can imagine that the sun's exposure to the sun is related to our physical and mental health.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This will affect our mood.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In terms of environmental vision,

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
people may look out of the window and see what the street scene is.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or the environment gives you a feeling of pressure or a sense of pressure.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This will also cause us to have different reactions psychologically.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The third point is that the urban structure of our society is closely related to our social interactions.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let me give you a simple example of my grandmother's house.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My grandmother's house is a fishing village in the south of Taiwan.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The main urban design of this fishing village is like this.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There is a series of residential areas around the main provincial highway.

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This residential area is a large area.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The connection in the middle of this large area is a small alley.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The distance between each small alley is about five meters.

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In other words, the car can't get in.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There are two main types of houses in this residential area.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
One is a three-room house.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The other is a Milan-style building with about four or five floors.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The function of this three-room house in the residential area is that

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
there is an underground water drain in the middle of the three-room house.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So everyone goes to that place to chat and get water.

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Every time I go back to my grandmother's house,

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can often hear that everyone is quarreling in the alley or in the three-room house.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But no, they are just chatting.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In another era, when my grandmother's children grew up and lived in the city,

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
some of them moved to Kaohsiung City and moved to Taitung City.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For example, my father moved to a community building in Taitung City.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In this community building, their lifestyle became that

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when my father got home, he parked his car and went straight to the 11th floor of the elevator to the apartment.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Through the legend of the elevator in this apartment,

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
he was actually in the same building as his neighbor.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Maybe there was only a wall or a floor area.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But even so, it almost completely avoided the possibility of communication with those neighbors.

107
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So what is the lifestyle of our residents?

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It will also affect the way we interact with our neighbors around us.

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In the past, the study of what kind of urban lifestyle is related to mental health

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is actually a more abstract or simplified way of understanding it.

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It regards urban and rural as a spectrum of urban and rural.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In this spectrum, they are usually divided into two groups,

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that is, urban people and rural people.

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In these two groups, they conduct a lot of research,

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
including in Africa or other European countries, as well as the United States.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This study is a comprehensive study.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It collects data from dozens of European and American countries.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It turns out that in general, in these countries,

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the ratio of depression and anxiety,

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that is, the ratio of population infection,

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In the context of globalization and the constant increase of urban population,

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
it is almost impossible to say that

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
it is because living in a rural area is healthier,

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
so we try to encourage everyone to live in a rural area.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For me, there is a very interesting question here,

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that is, in urban environments,

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what kind of urban design and urban planning

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
can be psychological health?

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is my main research motivation.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let me introduce it to you.

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When I was doing this research,

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
in fact, there were already a lot of predecessors,

134
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that is, the previous researchers,

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
who had already thought a lot about this issue.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But in the study method,

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the past research is more limited to small-scale research,

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because they need to go through, for example, questionnaire survey,

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to understand what the living environment

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of their subjects is like.

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Because psychological health is a very complicated issue,

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
compared to other areas,

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
such as work, career, family life, etc.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Therefore, when it comes to the living environment,

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
in many cases,

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if the sample is small,

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it will be more limited to research.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Therefore, one of the main breakthroughs in my PhD program

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
is how we can use satellite images and big data

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to achieve a large-scale environmental feature,

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and then connect such large-scale spatial information

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
with health information storage,

153
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that is, the entire population of Denmark.

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let me show you

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
what the satellite image I am currently using looks like.

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This image is Landsat,

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
a satellite from NASA.

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It is summarized in series from Landsat 5 to Landsat 8,

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
from 1984 to the present.

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It took 16 days to take this image,

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
so you can see what the image is like.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This image has an obvious problem

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
when it is recognized in the form of a story.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can see the comparison of these two images here.

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The one on the left is Google Earth,

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
a high-resolution satellite image.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The one on the right is the same one.

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It is more clear because it is placed further away,

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but if we look at it closely,

170
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you will find that it is blurry

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
like a mosaic.

172
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's hard to really see

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
which side is the tall building, which side is the low building,

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which side is the crowded residential area,

175
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and which side is the windshield.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you want to use a satellite image

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to understand the entire city's

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
shape, structure, and health,

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
in my thesis,

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the first part of the problem to be solved is

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
how do we use artificial intelligence,

182
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
especially the power of learning,

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to solve the limitation of the satellite image.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The second part is that

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
when we make a breakthrough in methodology,

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and get large-scale spatial information,

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
how do we connect it with the satellite image?

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The first part of the study will be

189
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the first half of the study.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will let you ask questions first

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
when the first half of the study is over.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The first part is mainly about

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
when we get a satellite image,

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
like this picture on the left,

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
we hope to convert this satellite image

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
through machine learning

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
into the spatial information on the right.

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Spatial information includes

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
which parts of the image

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
belong to the tall building,

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the low building,

202
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the crowded residential area, and so on.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
In this study,

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
we will use the image of

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the limited landsat

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
to compare different methods of

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
machine learning and deep learning,

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to see which method

209
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
has more advantages in this topic.

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then we will see that

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
if this method can be trained well

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
in the Danube case,

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
can it be applied to other places

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and have more potential for expansion?

215
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
First of all, this is the framework of our classification.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
As mentioned earlier,

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
in terms of urban density,

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
it is a concept of gradient.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It will be divided into low density,

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
medium density, and high density.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In terms of building height,

222
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
this is a system designed

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
for the Danube context.

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There are not many tall buildings in the Danube,

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so you can imagine that

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
it is a system of building height

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
below the third floor.

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Above the third floor,

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
we call it an apartment

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
or an open space.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is an overview of

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the entire research framework.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In the upper left corner,

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you can see that

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
this is the satellite image

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
we use,

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
which has been integrated

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
from 1985 to 2018.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There is an image that

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
has not been affected by the cloud.

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
After obtaining this image,

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
we need to

243
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
let this model

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
learn something.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We need to give it some training data.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This training data

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
comes from Guangda.

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Guangda is simply

249
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
a laser pulse.

250
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When it hits an object,

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
there is a time difference.

252
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This time difference can measure the shape of the object.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Therefore,

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
this data is a 3D model

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of the entire Danube.

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We divide this 3D model

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
into two parts.

258
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
One is training data,

259
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and the other is verification data.

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In terms of models,

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we have three models.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The following is a common

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
method of learning

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
deep learning.

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It is not deep learning,

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but its computing speed is relatively fast.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The two models above

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
are deep learning models.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's talk about the middle one first.

270
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It is actually the simplest

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
rotating machine model.

272
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You often hear of CNA.

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The one above

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
is a little more complicated than the one below.

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But its base is the same.

276
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It also comes from a

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
3D model.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In the model design,

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there is a pooling layer

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
in the middle.

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
To put it simply,

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
what it is doing

283
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
is to

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
increase the speed of the machine.

285
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But what is it?

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I would like to introduce it to you now.

287
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As mentioned earlier,

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
when we use high-resolution

289
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
commercial satellites,

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
we can clearly see

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
the same structure

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and different architectural forms.

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But the same range

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is completely different.

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
In the same range,

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it is difficult to see

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
which side is the high-rise

298
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and which side is the flat.

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But if we can

300
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
consider the information

301
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
of the multi-level building,

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
it will be a little different.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
For example,

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
in this block of the high-rise,

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
there are three long

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
pixels.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The reason why the pixels are darker

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is because there are more

309
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
buildings in this area.

310
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If we look further,

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we can see

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the design of

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
this new community

315
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
is more

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
urbanized.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
For example,

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the buildings in this area

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
are more organic

320
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and more deformed.

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So,

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
on a larger scale,

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
we can see that

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the structure can help us

325
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
distinguish which side is the high-rise

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and which side is the flat.

327
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When we have trained

328
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
these models and data,

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
we will use

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the verification data

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to verify the performance of the model.

332
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What I want to mention here is that

333
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the year of verification

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
data is different

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
from the year of training data.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
For example, our training data is 2014,

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but when we verify it,

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
we want to know

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
whether the model

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that has been trained

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
recently can be used

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to draw a historical urban model.

343
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So, we found data from

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
2006 and 1995

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that can be used

346
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
to draw a historical urban model.

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Here is the research result.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I want to introduce

349
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the six types of urban models

350
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
in Denmark.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The first one is the high-rise

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
with high density.

353
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The high-density apartment buildings

354
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
are mainly located in the city center.

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Here, we found two big cities

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
in Denmark,

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Denmark and

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Denmark.

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
In this picture,

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
the high-density apartment buildings

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
are represented as one group in immigrant

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the rest areas are

364
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In this picture,

367
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the high-density apartment buildings

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
are represented as one group

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in immigrant communities,

370
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the rest areas are isolated

371
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
architectural formula

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
symbolize Denmark's

376
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
major residential system.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Republican apartments

378
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
are simply

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000

between city centers

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and settlements.

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
As you can see,

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000

386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000

389
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
high-density.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can imagine

391
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000

with lots of greenery

394
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
around it.

395
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What is a low-density

396
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This type of apartment

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000

401
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
or around the park

402
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and next to the river

403
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
to the first row of water.

404
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It is a high-density apartment.

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The low-density

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
is more common

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
than

765
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the lower-density

766
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
lower-density apartment

767
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
on the same floor.

768
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In other words,

769
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
relative to

770
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the lower-density

771
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
apartment on the same floor,

772
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the dwelling environment

773
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
in the lower-density

774
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
apartment

775
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
in the lower-density

776
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
lower-density apartment

777
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
is not as positive

778
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
as the higher-density

779
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
living environment

780
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
in the lower-density

781
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
lower-density

782
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
low-density

783
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and relative to

784
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the upper-density

785
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
middle-density

786
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
middle-density

787
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
low-density

788
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
lower-density

789
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
lower-density

790
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
middle-density

791
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
middle-density

792
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
middle-density

793
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
As you can see

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
When we go from

795
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
yellow to red

796
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It is gradually

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
more and more modulation

798
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
For example,

799
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
this high-density IR

800
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
In the original right of this curve

801
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Its risk relative to

802
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
the lower-density is relatively high

803
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
However, when it controls the modulation

804
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Its risk

805
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
is relatively reduced

806
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
In other words,

807
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the high-density IR

808
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
can be controlled by

809
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
other social mechanisms

810
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
However, even if it is excluded

811
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Its risk is about 1.4 times

812
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
higher than

813
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
the low-density IR

814
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
in rural areas

815
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
On the other hand

816
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
What is more interesting is that

817
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
we originally expected that

818
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
rural areas would have the lowest risk

819
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
However, in the case of depression

820
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
As you can see

821
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The lower-density IR

822
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
is relatively low

823
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Its risk is actually

824
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
lower than that of rural areas

825
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
In other words, although it is in the urban area

826
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But in this architectural state

827
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Its risk is actually

828
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
not higher than that of rural areas

829
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We just

830
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
found the risk-benefit relationship

831
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We present its spatial state

832
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
on the map of Denmark

833
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and

834
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
the three main cities of Denmark

835
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
including Copenhagen

836
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Aarhus

837
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and Corpus

838
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It also produces

839
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
an interesting pattern

840
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
In the original

841
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
we expected that

842
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
rural areas should be pink

843
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Everyone is happier

844
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The risk is relatively low

845
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
As you can see

846
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Not only rural areas are pink

847
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The city center of the city is also pink

848
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Especially in the city center

849
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
On the port side

850
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
on the river bank

851
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and some green areas

852
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
are the areas with the lowest risk

853
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Which area is the area with the highest risk?

854
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It is not in the center of the city

855
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Instead, it is in

856
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
the suburbs

857
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Especially

858
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the areas with more walls

859
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It is relatively

860
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the area with the highest risk

861
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So I want to go back

862
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
to the first question

863
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
of today

864
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What is a more sustainable

865
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
urban mentality?

866
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
According to our research

867
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
on mental health

868
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
In fact, we found that

869
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
there is no

870
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
linear relationship

871
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The higher the density, the better

872
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
or the lower the density, the better

873
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We found that

874
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
it is a combination

875
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
of low density

876
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and high density

877
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
In the case of Denmark

878
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
we found that

879
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the risk is relatively low

880
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It is like

881
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
a neighborhood in Denmark

882
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So you can see

883
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
In this area

884
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
for the residents

885
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
it is relatively easy to access

886
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
public facilities

887
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
including commercial activities

888
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
such as coffee shops

889
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It is also easy to have rest areas

890
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
such as parks

891
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
In comparison

892
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
In Denmark

893
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
these high density

894
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
low-rise

895
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
high-density flat areas

896
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
When the industrial development of Denmark

897
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
reached its peak in the 1970s

898
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
At that time, because of the huge population

899
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
many houses

900
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
were built outside the city

901
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
When they built

902
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
the design

903
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the density

904
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
of the population was very high

905
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
but there were no corresponding

906
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
commercial activities or public facilities

907
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
In our research

908
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
we found

909
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that

910
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
in the case of

911
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
moving houses

912
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
If the residents

913
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
moved to

914
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
high density flat areas

915
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
If the residents

916
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
live in such an environment

917
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
there will be a risk increase

918
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
In other words

919
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
compared to the residents

920
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
of high density flat areas

921
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
If the residents

922
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
moved to

923
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
high density flat areas

924
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
they will face

925
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
a higher risk

926
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So

927
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
we are talking about

928
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
environmental justice

929
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
or social justice

930
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
In Denmark

931
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
there have been a lot of

932
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
urban renewal cases

933
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
In the process of urban renewal

934
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
the city retained

935
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
or increased the urban green space

936
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and improved the quality of life

937
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
At the same time

938
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
it also increased the rent in the city center

939
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
In the past

940
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the city center of Denmark

941
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
was mainly for the workers

942
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
After these places

943
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
were upgraded

944
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
when the rent became more expensive

945
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
some people

946
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
had to move to

947
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
lower rents

948
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
At the same time

949
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the city council

950
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
contributed a lot

951
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
in this study

952
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is a problem

953
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that needs to be noticed

954
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
in urban planning

955
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
so that we can provide

956
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
a more fair

957
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and comfortable

958
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
living environment

959
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Finally

960
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I would like to summarize

961
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the position of this study

962
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
in academic research

963
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
First of all

964
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
in the past

965
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the researchers

966
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
mainly looked at the expansion

967
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
of the city

968
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and simplified it

969
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
into a concept of

970
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
dual contrast

971
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But

972
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
in addition to

973
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the expansion of

974
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
if we can

975
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
look at some

976
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
urban design conditions in more detail

977
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
such as density and height

978
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
we will have a chance

979
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to talk more

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in the field of urban planning

981
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and talk more about

982
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
psychological health

983
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and other research

984
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
related to the extension

985
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
In the second part

986
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the position of this study

987
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is to use a global

988
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
method to conduct research

989
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The advantage of global technology

990
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
is that when this method

991
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
is proposed

992
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
it can be applied to

993
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
many other countries

994
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
At the same time

995
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
it has a limitation

996
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
as mentioned earlier

997
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
because its coverage

998
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is very large

999
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and has a long history

1000
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
so it is actually

1001
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
a relatively limited

1002
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and difficult topic

1003
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Therefore, through

1004
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
in-depth study

1005
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
we can make progress

1006
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
on this topic

1007
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This topic is actually

1008
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
very broad

1009
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It requires a lot of people

1010
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
from different professional backgrounds

1011
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
to join in, including psychology, urban planning

1012
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and epidemiology

1013
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So I look forward to

1014
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
discussing more with you

1015
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Finally, I would like to

1016
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
briefly share

1017
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
my next plan

1018
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I have a fellowship

1019
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
in Yale in the next two years

1020
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
My plan is

1021
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
to expand

1022
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
the three-dimensional

1023
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
urban characteristics

1024
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I just mentioned

1025
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
to the global research area

1026
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Under this global research

1027
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
it is not just

1028
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
the past

1029
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
urban research

1030
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Most of the research areas

1031
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
in Yale

1032
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
are in large cities

1033
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
such as

1034
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
5 million people

1035
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The scale of the city

1036
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
will receive a lot of research attention

1037
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
However, compared to Taiwan

1038
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
when urban development

1039
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
has reached its peak

1040
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
our urban update

1041
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
may be a street area

1042
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
These small-scale changes

1043
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
or small-scale urban developments

1044
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
in other Latin American countries

1045
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
or even in Africa

1046
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
their urban expansion

1047
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
tend to start

1048
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
from a small change

1049
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
These areas

1050
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
are relatively small

1051
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and remote

1052
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
so it is hard to be seen by satellites

1053
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Therefore, in the past

1054
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
we did not do much research

1055
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
However, in the future

1056
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
we plan to

1057
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
do more research

1058
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
in this area

1059
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is a brief

1060
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
reference

1061
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
for you

1062
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If you are interested

1063
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
you can read the articles

1064
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
for more details

1065
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
That's all for today

1066
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Let's start the discussion

1067
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Thank you, Chi-Hsing

1068
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If there are

1069
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
any questions

1070
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
please feel free

1071
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
to raise your mic

1072
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
to join the discussion

1073
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
At the first stage

1074
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
there was a question

1075
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
from Xu Shi-Che

1076
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Do you want to

1077
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
raise your mic

1078
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
to ask Chi-Hsing?

1079
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay

1080
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Xu Shi-Che

1081
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
seems to say

1082
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
his mic is not working

1083
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Let me ask him

1084
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
his question

1085
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
His question is

1086
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
how much

1087
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
overall accuracy

1088
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
do you need

1089
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
to be able to

1090
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
distinguish

1091
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
your urban

1092
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
development

1093
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
between 6 types of urban

1094
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and 2 types of urban

1095
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This is a question

1096
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
from the first stage

1097
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That's a good question

1098
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Because

1099
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
overall accuracy

1100
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
is hard to

1101
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
distinguish

1102
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Overall accuracy

1103
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
is easy to be

1104
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
distinguished

1105
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
by one type

1106
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We need to

1107
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
look at

1108
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
accuracy matrix

1109
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
In this matrix

1110
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
we can see

1111
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the top 3 are

1112
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
horizontal

1113
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and the bottom 3

1114
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
are vertical

1115
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and horizontal

1116
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
When we

1117
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
look at this

1118
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
we need to

1119
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
look at

1120
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
our own performance

1121
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
When each performance

1122
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
can reach

1123
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
60, 70, 80%

1124
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
then we can

1125
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
distinguish

1126
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Of course 60% is not good

1127
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But for now

1128
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
we need to be able to

1129
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
distinguish low density

1130
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
houses from

1131
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
non-houses

1132
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It is relatively difficult

1133
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
When we see

1134
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
our own performance

1135
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
we can know

1136
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
how to improve

1137
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
our performance

1138
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Any other questions?

1139
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Hello

1140
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I have a question

1141
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
about

1142
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Thank you for your speech

1143
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I think it is very interesting

1144
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
My question is

1145
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You found that

1146
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
urban conditions

1147
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
are related to

1148
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
residents'

1149
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
mental health

1150
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Although it is not a simple

1151
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
linear relationship

1152
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I am curious

1153
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
At the beginning

1154
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
you mentioned some

1155
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
possible connections

1156
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
For example,

1157
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
we can have

1158
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
social activities

1159
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
so that people can

1160
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
get along better

1161
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But you did not

1162
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
measure it

1163
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So I am curious

1164
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What is your

1165
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
imagination

1166
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
about this mechanism

1167
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Do you have any

1168
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
future research

1169
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
to measure it?

1170
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I think

1171
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
this question

1172
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I always

1173
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
hear my own answer

1174
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I turn off

1175
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
my microphone

1176
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Thank you

1177
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In fact, I think

1178
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
when we do quantitative research

1179
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
large scale

1180
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
or big data research

1181
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
we often encounter a limitation

1182
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
that when we talk about

1183
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
this mechanism

1184
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
we can not measure it

1185
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So when we discuss

1186
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
For example, when we see

1187
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
that Denmark's

1188
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
high-rise buildings are

1189
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
in a low-risk state

1190
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
we will look for

1191
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
documents

1192
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
through interviews

1193
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
or through

1194
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
small scale research

1195
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
to discuss and respond

1196
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
to the document

1197
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
However,

1198
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
in my research, I did not

1199
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
measure it

1200
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
In the future,

1201
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
is it possible to

1202
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
directly measure social interaction?

1203
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
At present,

1204
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I see a chance

1205
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
to use social media

1206
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
such as Facebook

1207
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
or Twitter

1208
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to make improvements

1209
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
in this area

1210
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I am also curious

1211
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Do you have any ideas

1212
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
or suggestions

1213
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I

1214
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I

1215
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I have no special

1216
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I just want to hear

1217
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
your expert opinion

1218
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Because I am also quite interested

1219
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to know if you want to measure

1220
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
what are the possibilities

1221
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But I do not know

1222
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
how to do it

1223
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Hello

1224
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I am also doing

1225
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
urban environment and psychological

1226
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
research

1227
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
But I am doing

1228
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
green space

1229
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We will

1230
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Some say

1231
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
because there is a

1232
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
public space

1233
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
so people will gather

1234
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and there will be some social interaction

1235
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
There will be

1236
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
social well-being

1237
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
About this

1238
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
public space

1239
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I have a question

1240
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
In our research

1241
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it will affect

1242
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
mental health

1243
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I want to ask

1244
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
In your future research project

1245
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
will you

1246
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
turn green space

1247
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
into your

1248
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
control variables?

1249
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
In Denmark,

1250
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
the whole Northern Europe

1251
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
pays a lot of attention to green space

1252
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I have a research

1253
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It is not my research

1254
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
but there is a research in our team

1255
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It found that in Denmark

1256
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
it uses a standard

1257
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
NDE

1258
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It is from satellite image data

1259
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
to see

1260
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
when children

1261
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
in their childhood

1262
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
How high is the green space

1263
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
for them to adults

1264
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
will extend

1265
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
different psychological

1266
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I found

1267
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
green space is helpful

1268
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
In my own research

1269
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Green space

1270
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
is a hot topic

1271
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
for psychological research

1272
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
My next

1273
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
research

1274
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I will talk about

1275
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
cement

1276
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
architecture

1277
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and then

1278
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
cross analysis

1279
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
When they are

1280
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
what combination

1281
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
they will do

1282
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
effect analysis

1283
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Hello, I am Zhang Anping

1284
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Sorry, you just asked me

1285
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I thought about it

1286
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I am now

1287
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You listen to this thing

1288
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
How likely

1289
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
If we use

1290
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You see

1291
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Google map

1292
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Timeline

1293
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
GPS location

1294
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
plus

1295
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Wi-Fi location

1296
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
to infer

1297
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
a person's behavior

1298
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I am driving

1299
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I am walking

1300
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I am riding a bicycle

1301
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I am running

1302
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We can infer

1303
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
a person's behavior

1304
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
not on the timeline

1305
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But for the neighbor

1306
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
He comes in

1307
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Quite close

1308
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Walking distance

1309
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This is a kind of confusion

1310
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Use that way

1311
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
same as

1312
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Satellite system

1313
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Data

1314
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
To model

1315
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Or at least to index

1316
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Different people

1317
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The difference in their behavior

1318
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Then put this as

1319
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
To label them

1320
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Become a link

1321
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Urban design

1322
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Mental health or other

1323
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Well-being index

1324
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Link

1325
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Possibility

1326
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I think it sounds very interesting

1327
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
If you can really get

1328
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
For example, Google is willing to study

1329
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
File and then apply

1330
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Get these users

1331
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
The way you just talked about

1332
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Is it very

1333
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Can break through the current

1334
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I don't know what everyone is doing in this area

1335
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Discussion

1336
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Is that we can really predict

1337
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Some activities and then put the activity

1338
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What kind of space provides what kind of activity

1339
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Then enter the mental health

1340
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Can talk about this

1341
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Hello

1342
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yes, I heard that I want to respond

1343
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Just now Zhang Yanping and

1344
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Your research is

1345
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Mainly this information privacy

1346
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Problem

1347
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Because you said before

1348
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
The Danish Health Insurance Bureau's database

1349
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So it can reflect

1350
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Someone's

1351
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
His illness and residence

1352
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
A timeline

1353
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I think this

1354
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The feeling of privacy is very

1355
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Very high

1356
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Then you mentioned later

1357
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You also mentioned in the middle

1358
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There is positive

1359
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Force to move

1360
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I don't know how you know

1361
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
He is

1362
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
In what situation

1363
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
This is also a personal

1364
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Privacy information

1365
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You mentioned that you want to put this research

1366
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
To other areas in Denmark

1367
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
For example, you are in the United States now

1368
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Then you feel

1369
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Denmark you get this database

1370
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The completeness of this information

1371
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Those in the United States

1372
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Or in other countries

1373
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Can you get it

1374
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Because it feels very private

1375
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Personal

1376
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Back to the example of Zhang Yanping

1377
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That is

1378
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Personal

1379
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Personal activity

1380
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
But you still have his

1381
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Information about illness

1382
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Research in this area

1383
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The question you asked is very important

1384
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Is privacy

1385
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I can share with you

1386
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Denmark

1387
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Denmark

1388
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Their Bureau of Statistics

1389
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
How do they go

1390
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
To ensure that researchers

1391
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Do not hurt

1392
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Privacy

1393
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
The first one is

1394
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
We are in

1395
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Denmark

1396
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Denmark

1397
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Denmark

1398
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Denmark

1399
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Denmark

1400
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Denmark

1401
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Denmark

1402
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Denmark

1403
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Denmark

1404
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Denmark

1405
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Denmark

1406
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Denmark

1407
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Denmark

1408
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Denmark

1409
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Denmark

1410
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Denmark

1411
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Denmark

1412
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Denmark

1413
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Denmark

1414
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Denmark

1415
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Denmark

1416
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Denmark

1417
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Denmark

1418
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Denmark

1419
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Denmark

1420
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Denmark

1421
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Denmark

1422
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Denmark

1423
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Denmark

1424
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Denmark

1425
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Denmark

1426
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Denmark

1427
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Denmark

1428
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
sorry I'm back

1429
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
sorry I'm back

1430
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
can you hear me?

1431
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
can you hear me?

1432
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
this works, thank you

1433
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
this works, thank you

1434
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network

1435
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network

1436
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I will continue with the

1437
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
reply of the question

1438
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
reply of the question

1439
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
In Denmark

1440
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
the statistics office

1441
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
to use this data

1442
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
first of all

1443
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
this data is anonymous

1444
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and the people above

1445
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
although we will see

1446
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
there is an address code

1447
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
but the address code is not an address

1448
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
just a statistics office

1449
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
behind to connect these

1450
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
reading characteristics with their

1451
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
social and economic attributes, it needs to have a code

1452
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
to connect

1453
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
when we researchers

1454
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
see the data

1455
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
they can't see

1456
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
what the address looks like

1457
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
we only see those that have been

1458
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
linked

1459
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
so above

1460
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
we can't see who the person is

1461
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and we can't see the name of the address

1462
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
or what the name is

1463
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
so we

1464
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
analyze

1465
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
these variable combinations

1466
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
and the statistics

1467
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and the statistics

1468
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and the statistics

1469
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
and the statistics

1470
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and the statistics

1471
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
but we can't take any

1472
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
personal information

1473
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
so in this way

1474
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
we can only get a conclusion

1475
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
but we can't

1476
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
in this process

1477
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
leak any personal information

1478
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
what is it

1479
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
the second one you just mentioned

1480
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
how do I know

1481
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
who is forced to move

1482
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and who wants to move

1483
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I don't know

1484
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
in our research

1485
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
we don't actually measure

1486
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
this thing

1487
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
when we respond to documents

1488
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
especially Copenhagen

1489
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
when we respond to documents

1490
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
we find some documents

1491
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
that have been interviewed

1492
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
and they have targeted those

1493
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
recent

1494
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
because of Copenhagen

1495
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and the rent increase

1496
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
including some of the meetings

1497
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and some of the records

1498
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and the records

1499
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and the results

1500
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and we

1501
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
take this process

1502
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
as a discussion

1503
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and put it in our research

1504
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
and put it in our research

1505
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and the last question

1506
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
is

1507
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
this kind of research

1508
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
is it possible to be studied in other countries

1509
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
is it possible to be studied in other countries

1510
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
in the US

1511
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I don't know much

1512
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
about US security data

1513
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
but I have some knowledge

1514
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
about Taiwan security data

1515
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
when it comes to Taiwan

1516
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
security data

1517
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
it is possible to study

1518
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
psychological health

1519
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and we have ICD

1520
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
so in our security data

1521
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
every year

1522
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
it takes a million people

1523
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
to enter security data

1524
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and these people have their

1525
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
ID

1526
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
but in Taiwan

1527
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
it is different

1528
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
it is limited

1529
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
in living address

1530
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
currently in our security data

1531
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
we can study

1532
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
space information

1533
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the smallest unit is town

1534
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
so we can only

1535
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
study 360 towns

1536
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
in Taiwan

1537
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
but we can't study

1538
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
250 square meters

1539
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
this is what I know

1540
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
do you have any question?

1541
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
yes, thank you

1542
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I will ask

1543
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Xu Shizhe

1544
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
about

1545
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
accuracy

1546
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
he said

1547
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
from the picture

1548
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
if we choose

1549
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
deep lab

1550
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
we will sacrifice

1551
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
high accuracy

1552
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
how to

1553
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
overcome this problem?

1554
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
this is Xu Shizhe

1555
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I have a question

1556
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
about

1557
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
your second part

1558
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I am curious

1559
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
about the environment

1560
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
will change

1561
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and the environment

1562
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
how to

1563
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
incorporate

1564
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
these two

1565
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
aspects

1566
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
into your

1567
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
logistic regression model?

1568
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
this is my second question

1569
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
thank you

1570
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I will answer

1571
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Xu Shizhe's question

1572
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
indeed

1573
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
when we look at

1574
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the picture

1575
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
in the lower left

1576
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
indeed

1577
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
compared to

1578
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
the other two models

1579
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
the accuracy

1580
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
is lower

1581
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
when we

1582
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
consider this

1583
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
we will consider F1-score

1584
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
simply speaking

1585
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
F1-score needs to

1586
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
measure

1587
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
the balance

1588
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
between different categories

1589
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
if one category

1590
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
is very high

1591
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
the accuracy is very high

1592
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
it means

1593
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
if other categories are low

1594
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
it means this category

1595
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
is often overestimated

1596
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
the model will

1597
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
draw the whole map as tall buildings

1598
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
so that all the tall buildings

1599
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
can be measured

1600
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
but not all of them

1601
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
are tall buildings

1602
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
so other buildings

1603
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
are not drawn

1604
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
the accuracy

1605
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
of F1-score

1606
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
should be

1607
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
balanced

1608
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
this is my first question

1609
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Gao Xian's question

1610
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
is

1611
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the environment

1612
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
has time and

1613
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
historical changes

1614
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
how to incorporate

1615
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
these two aspects

1616
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
into your research?

1617
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I have another

1618
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
question

1619
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
when we

1620
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
track Danes'

1621
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
moving records

1622
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
or their

1623
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
historical record

1624
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
there are two factors

1625
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
that affect their

1626
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
environment

1627
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
one is

1628
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
moving

1629
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
another is

1630
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
in Danish data

1631
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
the main environmental

1632
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
changes are

1633
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
from moving

1634
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
not from

1635
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
fast urban expansion

1636
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
how to incorporate

1637
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
this into

1638
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
logistics?

1639
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
in the

1640
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
independent variable

1641
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
that we added

1642
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
in the last

1643
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
five years

1644
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
there is a

1645
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
difference

1646
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
between

1647
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
last five years

1648
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and this year

1649
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
this difference

1650
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
is a variable

1651
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
in our model

1652
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
the result

1653
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
is

1654
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
these five

1655
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
on the left

1656
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
are not only

1657
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
average

1658
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
but also

1659
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
high density

1660
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
if

1661
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
the change

1662
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
is positive

1663
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
it will

1664
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
have a higher

1665
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
contribution

1666
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Gao Xian

1667
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
did I answer

1668
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
your question?

1669
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yes

1670
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I am curious

1671
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
if you put them

1672
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
in the model

1673
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
will there be

1674
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
a change

1675
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
or covariance?

1676
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yes, there may be

1677
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
a contribution

1678
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
for each model

1679
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
there is a

1680
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
PIF

1681
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
the result is

1682
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
less than 5

1683
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
the contribution is not that obvious

1684
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I believe

1685
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
there must be

1686
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
a change

1687
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
in the model

1688
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
for each model

1689
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
the result is

1690
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
less than 5

1691
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
the contribution is not that obvious

1692
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I believe

1693
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
there must be

1694
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
a change

1695
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
in the model

1696
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
for each model

1697
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
the result is less than

1698
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
5

1699
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
the contribution is not that obvious

1700
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Any other questions?

1701
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I have no questions

1702
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Hi

1703
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
My name is Qiao En

1704
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I am a clinical psychologist

1705
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I am interested

1706
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
in urban planning

1707
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
and psychology

1708
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I read a paper

1709
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
about the different functions

1710
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
of land use

1711
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
for those who live in

1712
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
urban areas

1713
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
like Taiwan

1714
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
there are 7 floors

1715
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
1st floor for shops

1716
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
2nd and 3rd floor for residents

1717
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
in this case

1718
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
people are more likely to

1719
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
walk or ride bicycles

1720
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
just like the student

1721
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
who talked about

1722
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
social behavior

1723
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
for those who live in

1724
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
urban areas

1725
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or high-rise

1726
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
it is not easy

1727
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
for them to walk

1728
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and be healthy

1729
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
because they have to

1730
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
drive everywhere

1731
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
so I am thinking

1732
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
maybe in the future

1733
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
you can change this

1734
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to land use

1735
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
is it related to

1736
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
people's walking habits

1737
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
yes

1738
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I think

1739
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
it is a good direction

1740
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
in the future

1741
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I am interested

1742
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
in

1743
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
specific

1744
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
like what you said

1745
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
would they

1746
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
want to walk

1747
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
or ride bicycles

1748
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
in the future

1749
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
yes

1750
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I think

1751
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I am working on it

1752
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I think it is interesting

1753
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
it is a new field

1754
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I have not heard of it

1755
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
but it is interesting

1756
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
thank you

1757
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
what are you doing

1758
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I am doing

1759
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
health psychology

1760
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I am doing research

1761
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
about sports

1762
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and mental health

1763
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000

1764
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000

1765
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
yes

1766
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I think

1767
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
we can

1768
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
talk more

1769
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
in the future

1770
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
if you are interested

1771
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
we can

1772
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000

1773
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000

01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
