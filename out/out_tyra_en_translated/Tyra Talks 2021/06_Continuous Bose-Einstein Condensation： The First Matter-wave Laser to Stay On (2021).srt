00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome everyone to today's Taira Talk. Today is December 11th.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are very welcome to invite today's speaker, Chen Junjia.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Junjia is a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He has a Ph.D. in atoms and molecules.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He is currently working on a Ph.D. in light spectroscopy.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Junjia, if I interrupt you and ask you a question, is that okay?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No problem.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, let's get started.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
First of all, let's welcome Junjia with a round of applause.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Junjia, we'll give you the microphone.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, no problem.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you Jason. Hello everyone, I'm Chen Junjia.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What I'm going to talk about today is an experiment that was carried out in the experiment team of Florian Schreck in the Netherlands.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We carried out the first series of Bose-Einstein condensation.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can think of it as the first so-called series of radio waves.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In today's talk, first of all, I would like to introduce our experiment team.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My laser pointer is my PI.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
One of our experiments is the Atom Laser Project.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In addition, we also have the Molecule Cooling Experiment and the Tweezer Experiment.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is my outline.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First of all, I would like to briefly introduce what is Bose-Einstein Condensation.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why is this thing interesting?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where is the interesting part?

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And why do we want to make it a series?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Next, I will introduce our experiment team.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The two main points are that we take different experiments in our experiment method.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To find a way to achieve the so-called series of some cooling systems.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Finally, achieve a series of Bose-Einstein condensation.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In effect, it is a material wave laser.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Next, I will give some future outlook.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Bose-Einstein condensation is a theory proposed by Einstein based on Bose.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Identical bosons will undergo a phase change under very low temperature conditions.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
In the end, you can understand it.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Once I have reached very low temperature conditions in the experiment.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All my atoms will start to behave like waves.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In the end, all my atoms will behave like waves.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is coherent.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can think of it as a material wave condition.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The conditions for material waves are contrasted with temperature.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The lower the temperature, the longer the wave length.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In the end, a huge material wave will form.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is an animation.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I stole it from the Internet.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
As you can see, in the process of cooling.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The uniform material wave length of a single atom is getting bigger and bigger.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In the end, after reaching the condition of condensation.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It enters the process of phase change.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
All the condensation of the population of atoms is suddenly transferred to the ground state.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It is a bit like this behavior.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because it is a material wave.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In the experiment, we can also demonstrate that two groups of material waves interfere.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is an interference experiment in 1997.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Two groups of atoms interact or interfere.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can see some interference.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why is it interesting?

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because of the so-called huge material wave in the experiment.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can think of it as the wave function written in quantum mechanics.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There is a group of atoms today.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The function is the wave function.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can take this group of atoms to do simulation.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can write down some interesting Hamiltonian models.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then you can use BEC or Einstein's integral to simulate these models.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then observe some corresponding physics.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There is also the use of BEC in the experiment to do the experiment of atomic interference.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
For quantum information researchers, there is an interesting practice.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In the experiment, you first realize BEC.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then let it do a phase change process.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
In the optical lattice, the process of phase change.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can realize single-site occupation in the optical lattice.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That is to say, each of the optical lattice populates an atom.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You can do it through BEC.

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course, this is just one of the methods.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The conditions for reaching BEC are relative.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The temperature is actually quite important.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The reason is that you have to meet the corresponding phase space density.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That is to say, the density of the atomic group is almost the same as the wave length of the atom.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In the experiment, you have to reach a very low temperature.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Many substances have already formed molecules under low temperature conditions.

79
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In the experiment, you have to reach it in a thin atomic gas.

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The thin atomic gas has a corresponding atomic density.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The atomic density is to prevent the formation of molecules.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That is to say, there is a time constant of molecule decay.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You want to realize it in the thin gas.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The corresponding temperature is relatively low.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In the BEC experiment, the corresponding temperature is usually hundreds to tens of nano Kelvin.

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Since the 1980s, people have been interested in BEC.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The first proposal is to see the state of BEC in the thin atom.

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
At first, the thin atom is more suitable for such experiments.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But later, other experimental teams used the method of laser cooling to form the Bose-Einstein condensation on the EA group elements.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In 1995, the Bose-Einstein condensation was formed on the EA group elements.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Gradually, many atoms also achieved Bose-Einstein condensation.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In 2009, our experimental team realized the Bose-Einstein condensation of the thin atom.

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In 2013, we realized a technology called laser cooling to BEC.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will introduce it in the next video.

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Since it has the corresponding experimental difficulty, it was realized in 1995.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Six years later, three physicists won the Nobel Prize.

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The interesting thing about it is that it is a material wave.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can understand that it has a corresponding one-to-one relationship with the laser.

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
First of all, you can know that there is a cavity in the laser.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
After pumping the laser light into the GaN medium in the middle,

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
a stimulated emission is generated and the light is outcoupled.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In fact, it corresponds to a similar physical condition in BEC.

103
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My trap is an atom cavity.

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Pumping means that I need a new atom to come in.

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Once the density reaches the conditions of the space density I just mentioned,

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
my Bose-Einstein scattering will cause my atoms to have a tendency towards ground-state populate.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It is a material wave version of the equivalent laser.

108
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If my laser light can be outcoupled from the cavity, it is a laser.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My ultimate goal is to mix this BEC material in the cavity and form a so-called atomic laser.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
How to make this thing work with the laser light?

111
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In other words, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous material wave laser.

112
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
All the corresponding physical mechanisms,

113
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
such as pumping and stimulated emission,

114
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
must be able to achieve a continuous mechanism in the experiment.

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So our ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The continuous Bose-Einstein condensation is just a temporary goal.

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But its effect is already completed.

118
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If my laser light is not outcoupled from the cavity,

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it is the continuous Bose-Einstein condensation that we have achieved so far.

120
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
As long as the atom is not outcoupled from the cavity,

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
our claim is that we have achieved a continuous material wave laser.

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But we did not outcouple this material wave from the cavity.

123
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The interesting thing is that the laser version has been realized in the same year.

124
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But the material wave laser has not been made since it was realized in 1995.

125
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are the benefits of continuous?

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
First of all, its brightness is relatively high.

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because it is continuous, the divergence of the laser is relatively small.

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is mainly due to the continuous relationship of the laser.

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The continuous laser light has a stable phase.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you are outcoupling the laser,

131
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
because you are outcoupling the laser,

132
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
your phase may be interrupted.

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
In other words, it does not have a continuous phase.

134
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
However, the continuous laser light provides a stable phase.

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Therefore, in terms of experiments, we also hope to achieve a continuous material wave laser.

136
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's look back at the laser.

137
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The first thing we need to satisfy is population inversion and stimulated emission.

138
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
These two physical conditions provide you a magnification plus coherence.

139
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In other words, your phase is satisfied by the stimulated emission mechanism.

140
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In the magnification process, your phase is copied.

141
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Therefore, the phase before magnification is a coherent condition.

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In the material wave version, the phase space density must be high enough.

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
First, I must rely on a mechanism similar to the stimulated scattering to achieve a magnification process.

144
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In terms of experiments, the development process is to do the laser cooling first,

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
then do the stimulated emission cooling, and then achieve the stimulated scattering.

146
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The laser cooling first provides you a high enough phase space density.

147
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then, after the stimulated emission cooling,

148
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because the phase space density is high enough,

149
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the laser cooling mechanism will heat up the atoms.

150
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
At the next stage, I will do the stimulated emission cooling to achieve the stimulated scattering.

151
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
In the end, all the atoms will populate the ground state to achieve the wave 33.

152
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
In the experiment, when doing the stimulated emission cooling,

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
we usually turn off the laser cooling,

154
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:50,000
so that all the atoms will not be stimulated by the near-detuned light.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Therefore, we turn off the laser cooling.

156
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In the experiment, after the first stage of laser cooling,

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the stimulated emission cooling will turn off the laser cooling,

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and then further achieve the wave 33.

159
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you think about it carefully,

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the laser cooling and the stimulated emission cooling are two things that cannot be done at the same time.

161
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because the laser cooling still has a way to stimulate the atoms,

162
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
so I have to do the stimulated emission cooling after the laser cooling.

163
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Next, I will introduce how to achieve the wave 33 in the experiment.

164
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
In the experiment, there are two stages of laser cooling.

165
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The first point is the laser cooling in the second stage.

166
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The width of the wire is very narrow.

167
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In the experiment, we can achieve the temperature of 1 microKelvin in the second stage of laser cooling.

168
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We invented a mechanism called transparency.

169
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We can use this transparency to prevent the atoms from seeing the laser cooling light.

170
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
How do we do it in the experiment?

171
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
First of all, after the atoms have finished the laser cooling,

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
they will be trapped in a microwave.

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In principle, the laser cooling light can achieve the laser cooling in the microwave.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
However, the atoms can still see the laser light.

175
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
However, today I introduced a light to address the excited state

176
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and a higher excited state.

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The mechanism introduces a so-called stark shift,

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which may affect the connection of the excited state.

179
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In space, it's like letting the atoms in the middle

180
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because of the transparency beam,

181
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the excited state is moved.

182
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You can imagine that there is a light in the middle,

183
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but because the excited state has a stark shift,

184
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
it shifts far away.

185
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
In principle, the atoms in the middle can't see the light on the beam.

186
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
In the experiment, you can think about the two photos I took here.

187
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The one in the middle is the one without the transparency beam.

188
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I used this light to absorb the image.

189
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In principle, the atoms can see this light,

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
so I can calculate the atom distribution on the corresponding equation.

191
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Once I hit the transparency beam,

192
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the atoms in the middle can't see this light.

193
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When I analyze it, it can't see the light,

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so it doesn't absorb my light.

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So it feels like there is no atom there.

196
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
In fact, what happened was that

197
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because of the transparency beam,

198
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
my excited state's energy shifted,

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and the atoms in the middle couldn't see my light.

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
By doing this, we found that

201
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
we can achieve BC conditions in the experiment.

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So we combined three experimental advantages.

203
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The first advantage is that there are two stages of laser cooling.

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Interestingly, the temperature of the second stage of laser cooling

205
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
can reach very low temperatures.

206
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
In the experiment, we added a very deep microscope

207
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
with a dipole trap in the middle

208
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to increase the density in the middle to a very high level.

209
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
In the experiment, we added this transparency beam

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser cooling light.

211
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In the experiment,

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
we added a reservoir next to it

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
where I can continue to do my laser cooling.

214
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But in the middle,

215
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.

216
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The atoms interact with the surrounding laser cooling conditions,

217
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so the temperature can continue to reach very low.

218
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But in the middle,

219
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
because of the transparency beam,

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.

221
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They can experience the process of image transformation

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
without being affected by the laser cooling mechanism.

223
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In the experiment,

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
we can skip the step of evaporation and cooling.

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay, please go ahead.

226
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Can I ask a question?

227
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Can I go back to the page?

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

229
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is Dimple Trick the same as the Transparent Beam?

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

231
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Dimple Trick is a different beam.

232
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
For example,

233
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the wavelength is 1064 nanometers.

234
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The high power to form this Dimple Trap

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
is called the dimple trap.

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Dimple Trap is formed by light.

237
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
For example,

238
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
this part of the reservoir is a parallel focused light.

239
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The dimple in the middle is focused in a vertical direction.

240
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The dimple trap is formed in the intersection of the two.

241
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Dimple Trap is the laser light added in a vertical direction.

242
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The laser light makes the dimple trap deeper.

243
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The corresponding effect is that

244
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
the density of the atom is increased in that position.

245
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What about Transparent Beam?

246
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What is the intersection of 1064?

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.

249
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The reason is that

250
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
it doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.

251
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Its function is not to drive a transition.

252
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Its function is to

253
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
through this

254
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
dimple trap.

255
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because it doesn't correspond to any transition,

256
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the high power is similar to the mechanism of light.

257
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It induces the dimple trap

258
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
in the space where the laser is focused.

259
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It induces the dimple trap

260
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
in the space where the laser is focused.

261
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The point is that you need high power.

262
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The laser light does not correspond to any

263
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
atoms' intersection transition.

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So, in practice,

265
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it is like a mechanism of

266
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the dimple trap.

267
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I see.

268
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The reason why Transparent Beam exists is that

269
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
it corresponds to

270
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the condition of light

271
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
from one excited state to another.

272
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, in practice, it can

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
make my original excited state

274
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
produce a star shift.

275
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
In practice, we can now

276
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
omit the phase of evaporating cooling.

277
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Next, we need to

278
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
find a way to

279
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
produce these cooling mechanisms

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
simultaneously in practice.

281
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
As you can see,

282
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
my Transparent Beam looks like this.

283
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The left side is the oven heated to 600°C.

284
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The atoms will come out.

285
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The first phase is Zeeman Slower.

286
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The next phase is Blue Motte.

287
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
After Blue Motte,

288
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the atoms will fall down

289
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to the chamber below

290
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
to produce Red Motte.

291
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
In practice, the chamber design

292
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
looks like this.

293
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, all the steps of laser cooling

294
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
are essentially

295
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
realized simultaneously

296
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in different positions in space.

297
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So, the atoms go through

298
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
my laser cooling

299
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
using this wave length.

300
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Then, they will go downstairs

301
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
to see the second phase of laser cooling.

302
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So, this is the concept of the experiment.

303
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Next, we will

304
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
make a concept map

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
for the experiment.

306
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The highlight here is

307
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the experiment chamber below.

308
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
All the laser cooling

309
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
using the narrow line width

310
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is realized in this chamber.

311
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
In the first phase,

312
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I can use

313
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
the wide line width laser beam

314
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
to produce 2D Motte.

315
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The atoms will continue

316
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to go down to the chamber below

317
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
to produce the second phase

318
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
of wide line width Motte.

319
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
After Motte,

320
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Motte will be loaded into Dipole Trap.

321
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Then, we will

322
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
measure the corresponding

323
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
properties of the atoms

324
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
after they are loaded into Dipole Trap.

325
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Or their conditions.

326
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, in principle,

327
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
the conditions of the atoms

328
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in Dipole Trap are very low.

329
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The speed is also very low.

330
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So, in principle,

331
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the speed of the atoms

332
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in Dipole Trap

333
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is about 10 cm per second.

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I have a question.

335
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What is it?

336
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It may be related to the picture you are talking about.

337
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I just went to the last page.

338
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I have a question.

339
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Why is your system

340
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
physically so huge?

341
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Is it because the distance between each station

342
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
is sufficiently separated?

343
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Is the scale

344
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
determined by the picture

345
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
sufficient?

346
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Good question.

347
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
First of all,

348
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
how big is the physical scale?

349
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Of course,

350
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the first phase is very large.

351
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But in fact,

352
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
we want to make it smaller later.

353
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But of course,

354
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
how far is the physical scale?

355
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This 2D Motte,

356
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
this blue light,

357
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
because the width of the line is wide,

358
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
so in the end,

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
you have to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.

360
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You can't have any

361
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
blue light conditions directly.

362
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Because the width of the line is wide,

363
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
it actually heats your atom very effectively.

364
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's put it this way.

365
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Not only heats your atom,

366
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
but also heats your BC.

367
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So for BC,

368
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
once there is any light,

369
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
it is in the near resonant condition

370
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and can drive your transition,

371
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
your BC is basically excited,

372
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and then your BC is gone.

373
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So in practice,

374
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
we hope to achieve a continuous cooling stage.

375
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Blue light is necessary for blue Motte,

376
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
because it effectively decelerates and cools

377
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the atoms coming out of the atom oven.

378
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You can think of it as a speed distribution

379
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
from 600 meters per second.

380
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You have to go through this blue Motte,

381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that is to say,

382
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
make a blue Motte

383
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
to reduce it to a speed distribution

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
of about 6 meters per second.

385
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Then from the speed distribution of 6 meters per second,

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
through another stage of Motte

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
to further decelerate it.

388
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So in practice,

389
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
physically, we need to have enough space,

390
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
mainly because we want to make sure

391
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that we finally achieve

392
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
the cooling of the BC.

393
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
In this space,

394
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
my corresponding temperature distribution

395
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
is in the tens to hundreds of nanocelvin level.

396
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But at the beginning,

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
for example,

398
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the temperature of the atomic group here

399
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is in the one-minicelvin level.

400
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Then the light here,

401
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
in principle,

402
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
as long as your BC is condensed,

403
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
when you see this light,

404
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
in principle, it will be activated immediately,

405
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and your BC will be destroyed immediately.

406
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So in practice,

407
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
our design is to ensure that

408
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the laser cooling mechanism of the first stage

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
will not affect

410
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the experimental conditions

411
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to achieve the condensation of the BC.

412
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So physically,

413
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
it seems that the chamber design is very large.

414
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But this in itself is a problem of engineering.

415
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
For example,

416
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in principle,

417
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
these attenuators and filters in the middle

418
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
are designed to reduce these scattering lights

419
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to be able to affect

420
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the condensation of the BC produced later.

421
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't know if I have answered the question.

422
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

423
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I understand.

424
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Thank you.

425
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Next is the following chamber.

426
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
In principle,

427
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
after the second stage of the red mod,

428
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
we still show up in the dipole guide.

429
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We have a deceleration mechanism.

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
In other words,

431
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I just said that

432
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I have just measured

433
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the speed distribution of the axis in the dipole guide.

434
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It is a speed distribution of 10 cm per second.

435
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then I have a deceleration mechanism.

436
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In principle,

437
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
it also applies some physics related to the mod.

438
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
In other words,

439
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I have a mod here.

440
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It has a magnetic field distribution in space.

441
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So I can use this magnetic field distribution

442
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to do something like

443
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Zeeman Decelerator,

444
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a mechanism of Zeeman Slower

445
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to do a deceleration process

446
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
corresponding to the laser cooling light.

447
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In principle,

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
here you can see that

449
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
my original value is indeed decelerated.

450
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Then,

451
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
after deceleration,

452
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in our experiment,

453
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
we did a microscope here again.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's a bit like

455
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
letting the atom be decelerated in the dipole guide.

456
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's like a turning process.

457
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Then hide in this new microscope.

458
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then in this microscope,

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
we have to realize

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and add the Transparency Beam introduced earlier.

461
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Then I hope that

462
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
in this space,

463
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I can realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.

464
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Assuming that

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I zoom out now.

466
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The last microscope

467
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
looks like this in the experiment.

468
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Here is the atom in the ground state.

469
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Then I have a dipole

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to deepen my microscope.

471
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Let my atomic group

472
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
have a higher density here.

473
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Then in the same position,

474
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I have added a beam

475
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
to let my excited state

476
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
be shifted away.

477
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So my laser cooling

478
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
only occurs around.

479
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So the temperature of the atom here

480
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
can be very low.

481
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But these beams

482
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
are mainly used for laser cooling

483
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
to reduce the temperature.

484
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then the middle part,

485
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I want to realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.

486
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The interaction in the middle

487
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
is basically through

488
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
my Elastic Collision

489
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
to do the heat transfer.

490
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You can understand that

491
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in the Reservoir part,

492
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I try to reduce the temperature

493
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
by laser cooling.

494
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But the light of my laser cooling

495
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
will not affect

496
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
my Bose-Einstein cluster

497
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
in the middle part.

498
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Because in the middle atom,

499
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I can't see the light of my laser cooling.

500
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The heat transfer between them

501
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
is through the Elastic Collision

502
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to do the heat transfer.

503
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
In the experiment,

504
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the final result of all laser cooling

505
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
is to have a continuous

506
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
atom influx in the final Reservoir.

507
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The temperature is very low,

508
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the density is very high,

509
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and it reaches a condition

510
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
where my phase space density is high enough.

511
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
In the middle part,

512
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
because I can't see the light of my laser cooling,

513
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and the phase space density is high enough,

514
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
under such conditions,

515
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I can start Bose-Enhanced Gathering.

516
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Finally, I can achieve

517
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster

518
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
in the middle part.

519
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Now, let me tell you

520
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
that I have achieved a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster.

521
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Of course, in the experiment,

522
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
we have to prove that it is a Bose-Einstein cluster.

523
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Now, let me show you

524
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
what they observed in the experiment

525
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
when they first made

526
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the Bose-Einstein cluster in 1995.

527
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What you see now is the space distribution of the atom group.

528
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
When their temperature drops lower and lower,

529
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
you can see that the density suddenly appears in the middle.

530
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Bose-Enhanced Scattering occurs,

531
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
resulting in Bose-Einstein clustering.

532
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It corresponds to the sudden increase in density in the middle.

533
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
This is what they observed in the experiment.

534
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Of course, we also tried to observe in the experiment.

535
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I want to ask a question.

536
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Please go ahead.

537
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
In the previous experiment,

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I thought it was in the speed space.

539
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I saw it condensate.

540
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So, in the time and space...

541
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You mean...

542
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
For example, these pictures are basically...

543
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes.

544
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Condensate in the speed space.

545
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That's right.

546
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
In the speed space.

547
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's right.

548
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So, actually...

549
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You can think of it as...

550
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
In the speed space,

551
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
they did an experiment called Time-of-Flight.

552
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
In other words, if you turn off your condensate,

553
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
your atom group will start...

554
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That is to say,

555
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
convert your speed space distribution into actual space distribution.

556
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then you look at the distribution of the atom group

557
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to correspond to the original speed space distribution.

558
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
After they did the so-called Time-of-Flight,

559
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
let the atom group fly in space.

560
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Because it doesn't have a condensate.

561
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So, let the atom group

562
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
convert its speed space distribution

563
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
into a map out

564
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
to your space space distribution.

565
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Convert the speed space distribution

566
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
into space space distribution.

567
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You can see it in the experiment.

568
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Because once you have...

569
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That is to say,

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the speed space distribution is indeed in the middle.

571
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You have a large part of the atom group

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
distributed at that speed.

573
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
After converting it into space space distribution,

574
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
you can see this.

575
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
They call it Bimodal Distribution.

576
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's a bit like what I'm going to talk about next.

577
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That is to say,

578
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
here you can see...

579
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In the experiment,

580
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
at the beginning,

581
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
you can imagine that

582
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the time has started.

583
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Then wait for 2.2 seconds.

584
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Then my atom group in space...

585
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Finally, I did this Time-of-Flight.

586
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I went to see the space distribution of my atom group.

587
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
In principle,

588
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
it meets the Boltzmann Distribution

589
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
given by some Thermal Distribution.

590
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So, when you do fitting,

591
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it actually meets your Gauss Distribution.

592
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's put it this way.

593
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Once you convert your speed space

594
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
through the Time-of-Flight mechanism I just mentioned,

595
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and I'm doing 18 ms Time-of-Flight here,

596
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and look at its speed distribution,

597
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
it does meet my Gauss Distribution.

598
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Why is the right side higher?

599
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's space distribution.

600
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Because this is position.

601
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This is space distribution.

602
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You turn off the laser.

603
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Then I have a follow-up question.

604
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
For example, if you look at Time-of-Flight,

605
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
do you turn off the laser in one direction?

606
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Or do you turn it all off?

607
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If you turn it all off,

608
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I guess it will diffuse

609
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and spread to all directions.

610
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If you look at it in one direction,

611
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
do you turn it off in one direction?

612
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We turn it all off in the experiment.

613
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It does diffuse in all directions in space.

614
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But what we're looking at now

615
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
is a bit like taking a picture in space.

616
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Of course, we do it in a certain direction.

617
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's a concept of a interface.

618
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You can imagine it as

619
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I take a picture,

620
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and I do a point on the axis of the picture.

621
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So it corresponds to

622
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the speed distribution on the plane I'm looking at.

623
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Space distribution.

624
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Space distribution.

625
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because of Time-of-Flight,

626
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it corresponds to a speed distribution.

627
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Got it.

628
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
OK.

629
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
First of all,

630
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
when I look at it in the experiment,

631
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
my atomic group distribution looks like this.

632
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Do you think this is Gaussian?

633
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Actually, I have to say that

634
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
we have a landscape here.

635
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
As I just said,

636
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
the atomic group is basically

637
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
cooled in space all the way,

638
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and then it turns around and finally enters

639
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
my final space landscape.

640
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So here,

641
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
in principle, when we're fitting here,

642
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
let's say,

643
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
OK, I know what the space landscape looks like.

644
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Because I know how my Dipole Trap is designed.

645
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
That is, how is the space landscape designed in space?

646
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The atomic group's spatial distribution

647
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
is actually satisfied

648
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
under the conditions of such a space landscape.

649
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
In principle, it is a high-speed distribution.

650
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This is what I want to say.

651
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
In today's experiment,

652
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
if I wait a little longer today,

653
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
it's a bit like saying,

654
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
when I turn it on,

655
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
at the end,

656
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
once my laser starts lacing,

657
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'll wait another 3.2 seconds,

658
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and it's already lacing.

659
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If I turn off all the lights,

660
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and look at the spatial distribution,

661
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
the spatial distribution,

662
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and the spatial distribution.

663
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You can see that

664
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
it's a bit like BC's proof.

665
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's a bimodal distribution.

666
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So in the first step,

667
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'll prove that

668
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I've seen BC in the experiment.

669
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Is it continuous?

670
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
In the experiment,

671
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
of course, we started doing it.

672
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The longer I wait,

673
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
from the beginning,

674
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
0 seconds, it's gone.

675
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Then at about 3.2 seconds,

676
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it's almost there.

677
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Then I waited all the way.

678
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
In principle,

679
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the state of BC

680
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is to continue.

681
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In my experiment,

682
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I measured up to 5 minutes.

683
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That is to say, 5 minutes,

684
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
this state

685
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
has been there.

686
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You say I can measure longer.

687
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I can.

688
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So in the experiment,

689
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
in principle,

690
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
we only measured up to 5 minutes.

691
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But in principle,

692
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
this state is

693
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that is to say,

694
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
in principle,

695
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
it has been maintained there.

696
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's a continuous state.

697
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's it.

698
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Of course,

699
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
let's take a closer look

700
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
at the conditions of my

701
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Boltzmann's condensation.

702
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
For example,

703
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
how much Boltzmann's condensation

704
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
did I achieve?

705
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Here it is.

706
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
OK,

707
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
at about 3.2 seconds,

708
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
you can see that

709
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the number of BCs

710
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
has started to increase.

711
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Next,

712
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
we will maintain

713
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
a condition here.

714
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Of course,

715
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
let's draw it out a little bit.

716
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That is to say,

717
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
this is a detection

718
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
limit.

719
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That is to say,

720
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
did I observe

721
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
my Boltzmann's condensation

722
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
above my imprecision?

723
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
In principle,

724
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
we did.

725
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
In principle,

726
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the condition of this BC

727
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
has been maintained

728
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
here for 2 to 60 seconds.

729
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I have a question.

730
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Go ahead.

731
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
How did you get

732
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
the blue data

733
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
error bar?

734
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The blue data error bar

735
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is basically

736
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that we measured

737
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
at least 5 times

738
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
in the same condition.

739
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OK.

740
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
To make an error bar.

741
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
OK.

742
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So,

743
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the size of the error bar

744
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
is not only related to

745
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
the number of BCs,

746
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but also related to

747
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
how many times you measured.

748
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's right.

749
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
OK.

750
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So,

751
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
actually,

752
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
some numbers,

753
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
numbers,

754
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
that is,

755
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the central value

756
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
is very close,

757
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
but the error bar is not the same size.

758
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Is it because of the difference in this part?

759
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yes.

760
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Oh,

761
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I see.

762
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
OK.

763
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
OK.

764
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Thank you.

765
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
OK.

766
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Then,

767
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
let's actually look at

768
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
our BC.

769
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Question.

770
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh.

771
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You can say it.

772
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Look at

773
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the previous picture.

774
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Its

775
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
BC at a number

776
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
is up and down.

777
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Does it have an oscillation?

778
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Or is it already stable?

779
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
OK.

780
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Good question.

781
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
In the experiment,

782
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
of course,

783
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
we have to say

784
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that

785
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
our data

786
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is not enough

787
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
to have enough confidence

788
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to claim that

789
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
this is an

790
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
interesting

791
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
physical oscillation.

792
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Because

793
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
it is possible

794
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that

795
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
you don't see

796
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
a very obvious cycle

797
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
behavior.

798
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
On the other hand,

799
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
when the experiment was just done,

800
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
it was not particularly stable.

801
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So,

802
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the error bar is not small.

803
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Then,

804
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
we can only say

805
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that

806
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we have observed

807
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
that the wave function is very clear.

808
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It is indeed distributed

809
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
from the speed space.

810
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's just

811
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
that

812
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
these numbers

813
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
are from

814
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
fitting

815
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
BC

816
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
obtained

817
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
by the experiment.

818
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So,

819
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
this fitting

820
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is actually

821
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
how to say

822
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
In fact,

823
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
this fitting

824
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
gives

825
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
the uncertainty

826
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
is actually

827
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
not small.

828
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In the experiment,

829
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
they are indeed

830
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Bose-Einstein connection.

831
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That's just that

832
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
in the

833
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
fluctuation

834
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
of shot-to-shot,

835
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
there will be

836
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the first

837
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
stability of

838
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the experiment itself

839
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
to what extent

840
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
plus

841
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
my fitting

842
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
corresponds to

843
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
this

844
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
uncertainty.

845
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So,

846
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it will give

847
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
what Yan-Yong just said.

848
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
My error bar

849
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
is actually

850
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
is

851
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
we

852
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
give a reasonable

853
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
error bar.

854
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That

855
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
but that is to say

856
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
BC's

857
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
feature

858
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
is

859
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
there

860
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is

861
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
exist.

862
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So,

863
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
BC

864
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
this thing

865
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is confirmed.

866
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But that is to say

867
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
the number part

868
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
we are now

869
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
our experiment

870
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
above

871
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
the

872
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
stability

873
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
is not enough

874
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
for us to

875
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
claim that

876
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
we have seen

877
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
any

878
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
effective oscillation.

879
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But

880
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
oscillation

881
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
is actually

882
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
interesting.

883
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Because

884
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
laser itself

885
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
is

886
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because

887
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
your analogy

888
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
just now

889
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I really like

890
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the

891
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
laser and

892
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
the

893
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
matter wave

894
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
to compare

895
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that

896
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
is

897
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
we also know

898
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
that

899
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
CW laser

900
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
if you

901
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
design

902
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
oscillation

903
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I just want to ask

904
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
that is

905
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
in this

906
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
in your system

907
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
there may be

908
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
similar mechanism?

909
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yes.

910
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There will be.

911
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
In fact, there is paper

912
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
also written.

913
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
In fact,

914
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
we also want to

915
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
try to measure it.

916
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because

917
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that is to say

918
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
just like you said

919
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
that is to say

920
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
this is a

921
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
with laser

922
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
some

923
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
comparative

924
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
physical system.

925
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
In fact,

926
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the difference

927
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
is only

928
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
my origin

929
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
is quality.

930
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
My light

931
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but

932
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
they themselves

933
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
follow some

934
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
laser

935
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
some

936
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
type of

937
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
mechanism.

938
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So

939
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
you talk about those

940
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
oscillation

941
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
or

942
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
relaxation

943
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
that is to say

944
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
will

945
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
we expect

946
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
in

947
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
this

948
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
system

949
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
there is a way

950
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
to observe

951
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
but we

952
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
have this idea

953
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
want to go

954
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
measure

955
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
no data

956
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
have not measured

957
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
can only say

958
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
no

959
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that

960
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
ok

961
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that

962
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
on the experiment

963
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I am now

964
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to correspond to some

965
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
data after fitting

966
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
on the experiment

967
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
we achieved

968
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
almost

969
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
in such a

970
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
continuous

971
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
physical

972
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
or

973
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
laser

974
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
experiment

975
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
system

976
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
we have a way

977
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
to produce

978
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
every second

979
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
loading rate

980
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I did not give

981
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
but

982
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
in fact

983
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
in

984
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
once

985
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
into

986
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
stable

987
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
stable conditions

988
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
after

989
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
my

990
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Bose-Einstein connection

991
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
is almost

992
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
in this

993
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
number

994
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
7 x 10

995
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
3

996
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
7000

997
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and

998
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
then

999
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
around

1000
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the

1001
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
origin

1002
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
for example

1003
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
around

1004
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the reservoir

1005
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
part

1006
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
almost

1007
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
the number

1008
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
is in

1009
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
700

1010
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
K

1011
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
when

1012
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Jason

1013
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
said

1014
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
we

1015
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
want to see

1016
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
some

1017
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
for example

1018
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
BEC

1019
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
his

1020
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
oscillation

1021
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
behavior

1022
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
because these

1023
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
correspond to

1024
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the

1025
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
laser-related

1026
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
some

1027
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
physical

1028
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
mechanism

1029
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
that

1030
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
we hope

1031
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
to be in the

1032
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
experiment system

1033
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
in the

1034
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
BEC

1035
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
we now

1036
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
do it

1037
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
to see

1038
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
similar behavior

1039
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
because

1040
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
we can

1041
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
explain

1042
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
our

1043
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
data

1044
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
why

1045
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
there seems to be

1046
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
some

1047
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
oscillation

1048
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
behavior

1049
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
like

1050
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I just

1051
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
said

1052
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
the stability of

1053
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
our experiment

1054
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
is not enough

1055
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
to make us

1056
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
say

1057
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
that

1058
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
this

1059
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
corresponds

1060
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
to

1061
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the

1062
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
oscillation

1063
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
claimed

1064
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
by

1065
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
the

1066
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
laser

1067
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but

1068
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
theoretically

1069
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
now

1070
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
we are

1071
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
also

1072
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
interested in

1073
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
trying to

1074
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
measure it

1075
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
here

1076
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
is a

1077
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
from

1078
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
the

1980s

1081
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
we

1082
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
really

1083
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
started

1084
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
to find

1085
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
BEC

1086
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
in hydrogen

1087
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
in the

1088
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
original

1089
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
19 years

1090
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
we

1091
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
even

1092
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
tried to

1093
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
make

1094
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
so-called

1095
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
continuous

Bose-Einstein

1097
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
connection

1098
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
to produce

1099
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
this

1100
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
very low-temperature

1101
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
atomic

1102
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
beam

1103
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
like this

1104
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and it

1105
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
so-called

1106
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
in the dark

1107
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
means that

1108
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
it is in

1109
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
my

1110
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
microscope

1111
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
guide

1112
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
that is

1113
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
in a

1116
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
microscope

1117
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and

1118
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it

1119
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
around

1120
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
there is

1121
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
no

1122
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
near-resonant

1124
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that is

1125
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
there is

1126
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
almost

1127
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
no

1128
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
laser light

1129
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to heat it

1130
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to very hot

1131
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
so that

1132
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
the experiment is that

1133
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I am satisfied with the

1134
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
experiment system

1135
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
to achieve a

1138
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
like this

1139
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
that

1140
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
experiment

1141
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
we of course

1142
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
also achieved

1143
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
continuous

1144
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Bose-Einstein

1145
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
connection

1146
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
that

1147
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
next

1148
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
to do

1149
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
what research

1150
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is interesting

1151
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that of course

1152
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
for example

1153
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
continuous

1154
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
super-cold

1155
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
atomic number

1156
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
is very interesting

1157
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
that is

1158
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
you put this

1159
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
very cold

1160
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
atomic number

1161
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
through a

1162
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
cavity

1163
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
when

1164
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you may

1165
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
let the atom

1166
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
in the cavity

1167
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it has this

1168
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
we call

1169
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
collective

1170
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
emission

1171
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
of

1172
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
behavior

1173
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
that is

1174
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
it

1175
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
that

1176
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
private atom

1177
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
it is actually

1178
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
the first stage of

1179
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
light

1180
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
in fact

1181
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
one of the

1182
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
candidates

1183
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
that it

1184
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
has a

1185
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
very low

1186
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
emission rate

1187
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
that

1188
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
can be used

1189
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to define

1190
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the time

1191
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
in this

1192
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
experiment

1193
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
mechanism

1194
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
or

1195
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
in this

1196
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
experiment

1197
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
we hope

1198
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
to take this

1199
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
very cold

1200
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
atomic number

1201
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
through a

1202
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
cavity

1203
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
after

1204
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
the

1205
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
cavity

1206
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
direction

1207
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
to

1208
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
have some

1209
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
collective

1210
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
that is

1211
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
it has

1212
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
some

1213
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
corresponding

1214
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
effect

1215
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and

1216
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
then

1217
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
in this

1218
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
very

1219
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
narrow

1220
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
light

1221
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
very

1222
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
narrow

1223
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
emission rate

1224
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to

1225
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
do

1226
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
emission

1227
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and

1228
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
in principle

1229
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
it can be

1230
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
a very

1231
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
accurate

1232
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
light

1233
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
that is

1234
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
or

1235
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
very

1236
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
accurate

1237
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
laser

1238
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
because it is

1239
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
directly from the

1240
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
atomic number

1241
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
itself

1242
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and then

1243
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
it can

1244
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
be

1245
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
a new

1246
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
technology of

1247
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
light

1248
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
that

1249
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
on the other hand

1250
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
of course

1251
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
we have now realized

1252
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
continuous wave

1253
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
of course

1254
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
we want to

1255
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
further

1256
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
put the

1257
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
atomic number

1258
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
from this

1259
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
cavity

1260
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
inside

1261
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
cover out

1262
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
that we

1263
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
can be

1264
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
called

1265
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
we realized

1266
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
true

1267
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
continuous

1268
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
atomic

1269
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
laser

1270
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
because

1271
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
now

1272
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
but today

1273
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I want to do

1274
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
is that

1275
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
there is a

1276
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
mechanism

1277
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
is also put

1278
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
these atoms

1279
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
from the

1280
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
cavity inside

1281
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
cover out

1282
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
after

1283
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
the realization

1284
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
of this

1285
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
atomic

1286
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
laser

1287
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that

1288
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
just

1289
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Jason

1290
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
also talked

1291
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
about

1292
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
is that

1293
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
the new

1294
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
matter

1295
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
wave

1296
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
it

1297
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
in principle

1298
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we have a

1299
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
lot of

1300
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
things

1301
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
that we

1302
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
can measure

1303
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
the

1304
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
gain dynamics

1305
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
look like

1306
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
its

1307
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
oscillation

1308
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
behavior

1309
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
we have

1310
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
no way to

1311
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
measure

1312
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
these

1313
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
heat balance

1314
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
heat imbalance

1315
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
that is

1316
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
non-equilibrium

1317
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
some

1318
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
corresponding

1319
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
laser

1320
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
physics

1321
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
we also

1322
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
hope to

1323
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
observe

1324
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
in this

1325
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
experiment

1326
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
to see

1327
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that another

1328
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
course

1329
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
is that

1330
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
actually

1331
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
new

1332
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
for example

1333
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
tweezers

1334
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
atomic array

1335
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
qubit

1336
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
they

1337
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
for example

1338
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
this new

1339
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
paper

1340
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
they

1341
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
say

1342
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
they can

1343
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
tweezers

1344
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
inside

1345
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
to realize

1346
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000

1349
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000

1353
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
then

1354
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
they

1355
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
these

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I can

1370
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
them

1371
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000

1375
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
you can

1376
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
imagine

1377
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
that

1378
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
it

1379
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
becomes

1380
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
a bit

1381
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000

1388
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000

operation

1392
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
because I can

1393
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
continuously

1394
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
use my

1396
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000

1397
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
them

1398
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
this

buffer

1400
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
then

1401
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
they

1402
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
after

1403
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
the operation

1404
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to do

1405
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
what to do

1406
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but

1407
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I

1408
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
follow

1409
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
these

1410
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
buffers

1411
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I can

1412
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
fill

1413
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
it

1414
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
this

1415
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
is a

1416
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
concept

1417
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
that

1418
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I

1419
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
can

1420
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
implement

1421
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000

experiment

1425
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
so

1426
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
this is

1427
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
my

1428
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000

1429
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
today

1430
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
thank

1431
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
you

1432
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
let's

1433
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
applaud

1434
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
now

1435
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
if

1436
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
you have

1437
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
any

1438
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
questions

1439
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
please

1440
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
ask

1441
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I

1442
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
have

1443
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
a

1444
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
question

1445
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
that

1446
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
if

1447
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
you can

1448
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
make the

1449
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
system

1450
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
smaller

1451
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
do you

1452
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
think

1453
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
there is

1454
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
a limit

1455
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
that

1456
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you can't

1457
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
make it

1458
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
smaller

1459
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
like

1460
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
it can't

1461
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
be smaller

1462
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
than

1463
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
some

1464
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
absolute

1465
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
scale

1466
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
so it

1467
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
is this

1468
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
small

1469
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
or

1470
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
do you

1471
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
think

1472
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
there is

1473
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
no

1474
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
limit

1475
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
if

1476
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
it

1477
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
is

1478
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
small

1479
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I

1480
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
think

1481
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
iphone is

1482
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
the limit

1483
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
but

1484
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
this is a

1485
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
very big

1486
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
limit

1487
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
that is

1488
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
the size

1489
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
of the

1490
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
iphone

1491
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
the

1492
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
main

1493
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
reason is

1494
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
because

1495
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
some

1496
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
physical

1497
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
restrictions

1498
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
such as

1499
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
how good

1500
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
my

1501
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
experiment

1502
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
is

1503
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
to

1504
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
produce

1505
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
these

1506
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
atoms

1507
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and then

1508
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
do further

1509
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
laser cooling

1510
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
this

1511
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
oven

1512
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
depends on

1513
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
the

1514
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
atom steam

1515
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
so you

1516
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
actually have

1517
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
to heat

1518
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
your

1519
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
atom

1520
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
for

1521
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
the

1522
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
private

1523
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000

1524
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
,

1525
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
its

1526
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
heating

1527
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
temperature

1528
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
is actually

1529
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
quite high

1530
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
to 600

1531
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
K

1532
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
so

1533
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
the

1534
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
different

1536
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
cooling

1537
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
corresponding

1538
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
to the

1539
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
different

1540
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
laser

1541
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
width

1542
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
gives you

1543
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
different

1544
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000

1545
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
conditions

1546
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
so

1547
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
you can

1548
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
achieve

1549
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
this

1550
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
different
