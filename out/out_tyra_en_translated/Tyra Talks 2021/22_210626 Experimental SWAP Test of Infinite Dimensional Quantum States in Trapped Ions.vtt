00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you all for coming to today's Taira Talk.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Today's speaker is Zeng Kewei, who graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
After that, he did a PhD in quantum computing experiments in Singapore's CQT.

00:21.000 --> 00:43.000
He wanted to do quantum computing because he won the Nobel Prize for quantum computing.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
I remember when I won the Nobel Prize in 2012, I was wondering what was going on in this field.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I remember that the story really started like this.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
My high school teacher can testify for this, not me.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Today, he will mainly talk about the control beam splitter technology.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
Today's topic is Experimental Swap Test in Infinite Dimensional Quantum State.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Let's start with Kewei.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Before we start, let's turn on the microphone and give a round of applause.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'll leave the time to you, Kewei.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
No problem.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Can everyone see this laser pen?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Can you see this laser pen?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
This laser dot.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Thank you for listening to my talk today.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm Kewei.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
What I'm going to talk about today is the Exponential Swap Test of Infinite Dimensional Quantum System.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
This is an experiment in quantum computing.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Of course, I will talk about the theoretical background of quantum computing.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Then talk about quantum computing as a whole.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
I will use the infinite dimensional system, which is not a common quantum element.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
We use the quantum vibrational mode to do this.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I will first talk about the general quantum computer.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Then talk about the quantum computer using quantum vibration.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
If you want to do quantum computing, you have to be able to use those gates and logic to do the calculation.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
After talking about some of the standards of quantum computing, we will talk about the pros and cons of our lab.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Or our killer key is that we can make control gates.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
After talking about the theoretical part, we will talk about what we do in our lab.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Let me talk about this slowly.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
The first thing is to start with the scientific part.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
What is quantum computing?

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
If we just look at the general situation, we can say that quantum computing is not just pointing to 0 or 1.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It is not just pointing to the North Pole or the South Pole.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
It can point to any place between 0 and 1, including 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
In addition to 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1, it can also point to 0 plus i1 or 0 minus i1.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
It is not just a number, it can become a negative number.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
The first concept of quantum computing is that its quantum state is a negative number.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Because it is now a negative number, it can be between 0 and 1.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
This is why we often hear this addition state.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
It's amazing to hear the addition state.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
You see that one quantum element can have two addition states.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
100 quantum elements will have 200 and 100 qubits.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
This is a big number.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Is it because it can be obtained by parallel computing?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Of course not.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
The main reason is that when you actually measure, you randomly find an answer from these addition states.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
If you can't find the correct answer and select it, the result of your measurement is a random result.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
You can't just get the effect of quantum computing through addition states.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
So parallel is not enough.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
If you hear the complex number and the superposition, if you are doing quantum computing, you will feel that it sounds very similar to the electromagnetic wave.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Because if you use the addition state for the Maxwell equation, if you are in a rectangular or even just using a drum today,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This drum can also have superposition.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
It can have different tones.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
It can have different tones, and the tonal mathematical structure can also be expressed in complex numbers.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
The answer is whether you have measured this part.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
This is the first thing.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
If you have an electromagnetic wave in addition state today, you will not be able to measure the electromagnetic wave.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
The electromagnetic wave suddenly says that I only have 100 Hz left.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
The part of 200 Hz is gone.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
This is the first feature.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
The second feature is that quantum is not just one quantum element.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It's so interesting.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
The point is that it has to be entangled.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
It must have this entanglement between this quantum state or its connectivity.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Of course, we are talking about Schrodinger.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Let me talk a little bit.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
But let's start with entanglement.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Entanglement will make the quantum state have a very strong connection, but not a cause and effect relationship.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
Although its connection is still in the quantum space, so in the time and space, in our universe, it can be in a very far place.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
There is a very strong connection.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
But it can't do superlight transmission.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
So you won't see this kind of destruction.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It is a correlation, not a causality.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
This is something that needs to be emphasized.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
So quantum computing simply relies on the parallel superposition.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
It has to have a strong connection between these states.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
This strong connection, you would think that it may not be a problem in a small space.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
If there is an electron pointing up, the other electron must point down.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
On the contrary, if it points down, the other point up.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
There seems to be nothing.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It's just a very strong connection.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
But the problem is that if you let this connection run from the small world to the big world today, it feels like a very interesting situation.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Let's look at the picture on the right.

06:11.000 --> 06:20.000
If the first case is that your element is above or below, it may trigger a whole complex system.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
In the end, this cat will be in a state of death and fire.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It is often seen in Schrödinger's cat.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
If you look at this up, it means that if you go up, the poison gas will not be opened.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So the cat is smiling.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
If it is down, the poison gas bottle will be broken.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
This is the case of crying.

06:34.000 --> 06:46.000
So if you can use some physical mechanisms to slowly extend the interesting situation of small worlds through a bunch of chain reactions to the big world.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
You will often see this Schrödinger cat.

06:48.000 --> 06:58.000
The interesting thing about Schrödinger's cat is not just that the cat can be in a state of death and fire, but that you can make the small world of quantum mechanics look very magical.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
These strong connections can be extended to the big world step by step.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Because the cat does not suddenly become a death and fire.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
It must be through a certain kind of macro situation to slowly make it in a state of entanglement with small things.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
That's how we see this Schrödinger cat.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Of course, we do not see a human or a cat in a state of death and fire in the real world.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
This is an interesting situation.

07:24.000 --> 07:34.000
That is to say, when a huge object interacts with the outside world, it produces decoherence.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
In other words, maybe overall it is still a quantum type.

07:38.000 --> 07:55.000
However, if you have a big system called a cat, the exchange of information between the cat and the outside world will not be able to describe the cat in a pure state.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
It seems to have lost the outside information, which is called decoherence.

07:59.000 --> 08:08.000
This decoherence can be said to be the place where we talk about entropy in many places.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
You can say that the interaction between the system and the outside world produces decoherence from this decoherence.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
In fact, it is the measurement mentioned in the front page.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
It is a special process.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
In fact, it is just an interaction between the system and the outside world.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
The result of the interaction is that you only have the information of this system.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It is no longer a pure quantum state.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
Because it is not a pure quantum state, it will produce entropy when you describe this quantum state.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
Some people may know that a pure quantum state has no entropy.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
If you take the whole universe as a wave function, it will not have entropy if it is completely evolved according to quantum mechanics.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
It will not have decoherence.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But we can see decoherence and entropy locally.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
This is a place where we can talk about it in a special way.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
The last thing I want to say is that quantum mechanics is so interesting.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It has entanglement and superposition.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Through entanglement, we can solve all the problems faster than the index.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Of course, it is not like this.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
We can only solve a few problems and only solve different situations.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
The first category is whether we can find a problem.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But it hides some cycle patterns.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
As long as it is a hidden periodic function, you can use show arithmetic or a similar family.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
The key point is that you can do this kind of entanglement conversion.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
You can extract its cycle information.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
So if you have a hidden cycle information,

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
Show and a similar algorithm can solve this problem faster than the index.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
Of course, this is very important, but it is also a good definition and a definition limit.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It does not solve any problem.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
If you have a hidden periodic function,

10:14.000 --> 10:25.000
Of course, this is also directly related to the encryption method of the national defense industry.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Because we often see this kind of elliptic encryption or RSA encryption.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Will be directly attacked by show.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
It should be said that show was proposed in 1995 and 1996.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Show arithmetic is also the reason why the whole quantum computing or quantum computer will develop rapidly.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
You can say that 1995 was the year of quantum computing.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Show can solve this periodic problem.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Is there anyone else who can find something interesting?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
The answer is yes.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
So Grover said that if we want to do it today,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
For example, if we want to search for the name of a telephone book and its phone number,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
It has nothing to do with any hidden internal relationship.

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
If you want to search for a search without any structure,

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
You can use Grover to make your search faster.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
The number of times you need to search will be multiplied by the number of times you need to search.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
The interesting thing behind it is that you can actually use quantum random walk.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
You can use this kind of random walk that you often see in traditional computing.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Because in general, if you add some random to this CS algorithm,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You will make it perform better.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
In fact, Grover's quantum random walk is a one-sided relationship.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
But Grover can only be faster than the number of times.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It can't be faster than the number of times.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
If you have no knowledge of the problem you want to search for,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Grover has been proven to be quantum optimized.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It can't do better.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
If you want to search for some internal structure,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
You can use some special algorithms to do better than Grover.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
For example, if you want to find if there is a triangle in a pile of patterns,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
We know that a triangle needs three sides and three corners.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Because the pattern you are looking for today may have some internal connections.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It can do better than Grover.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
But if you don't know if you want to find this data,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Grover can do the best.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
These two are the algorithms produced by Shor and Grover in 1995 and 1996.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Is there anything interesting in the past 1, 2, 10 years?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
The answer is yes.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
HHL algorithm, or matrix inversion,

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
It is a big breakthrough in 2009.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
In the early days, we thought that HHL algorithm,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
It can be faster than the classical number of times.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Because it is faster than the classical number of times.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
If you can calculate the matrix inversion faster than the number of times,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
It means you can calculate linear regression faster than the number of times.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
It also means that you can calculate all kinds of interesting quantum mechanics,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Including PCA, SVM, etc.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
So HHL is one of the core of quantum mechanics.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
It was originally estimated to be faster than the number of times.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
But unfortunately, in 2019,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
Someone proved that the classical number of times can be faster than the classical number of times.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
If some quantum tricks are used in the classical number of times,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
The classical number of times is wider, but the quantum equivalent is not faster than the number of times.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
It's only ten times faster.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
So we now say that HHL is a bit of a quantum speedup.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Its quantum speedup is not so high.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
Its acceleration from the level of Shor becomes the level of Grover.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
It's still great, it's still fast, but it's not so fancy.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
That is to say, the quantum algorithm can only solve three problems in general.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
Find the cycle, find the data search, and find the inverse matrix.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
It can't solve the problem of arbitrary,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
There is no such thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But there are currently three major categories.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Then this is probably the part of the background we are talking about today.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
That is to say, if quantum is something interesting,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It can have additional states.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
But one additional state is not fun.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It must have a bunch of entanglement.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Then you can see those interesting things.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
What is the specific algorithm of entanglement?

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
You will see quantum Fourier transform, quantum random walk, and HHL.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
This is probably the part of the background introduction.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Okay, then we'll find this.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
This thing sounds very scientific, very mathematical.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
We have to find a real physical object.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
You can run, for example, what is 0 plus 1 or 0 minus 1.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
This kind of quantum element.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
We have to find one.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
In fact, we can operate it.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Really let it produce entanglement.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Let it produce entanglement.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
These quantum logic operations for us.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
So we have to find a physical object.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Because this world is that we are not living in the field of HHL.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
We live in the world of matter.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So we have to find the material to do this thing.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
So now there are two or a few more leading.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
There are two more famous.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
One is to do it with a quantum well.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Or do it with a super-mass chip.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
The quantum well on the left is what I did in CQT.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
This is the experiment.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
We are using a more primitive way of doing this.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
So when you hear the chip ion,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
The first thing you want to say is that you want to use one by one.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
You use one by one of the quantum in this vacuum.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
How do you catch the quantum?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Why can I do this thing?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Because it's not like you can clip it with pliers or something.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You have to think about why you can catch a quantum.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
So the first question is that we can catch it.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
The answer is that we can't take a quantum.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Hanging in a space without moving.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Because this violates Gauss's law.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
If you simply operate it through the power plant,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
It must be in a certain space.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
This is Gauss's law.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
So you can't let it stop at a point.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
But linear potentiometer,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
After you let it have an AC current,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
It can have an average confinement time.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
It is called Ponder Multi Potential in the professional field.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
But we can use very simple.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
We should do this thing by watching this video.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
This doesn't look very good.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Wait a minute.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay, now you can put it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So what we can see at this time is that

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
You have a quantum in a vibrating plant.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You can catch the quantum in a certain place without moving.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
So the first problem is solved.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
We know how to produce quantum.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
After we catch a quantum,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Remove one of its electrons.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And then we go through a vibrating battery plant.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You can catch it in space without moving.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
So the first two quantum can be caught.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
There is no problem.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
What are the advantages of quantum?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
What are the benefits of saying that we caught it?

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
The first one is that the quantum lives in a very, very high vacuum.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It's probably 10 to the 12th square.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
It's not a problem.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
How vacuum is it?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
It's more than what we see.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
The degree of vacuum is more than the track between the earth and the moon.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Low-Earth vacuum is still vacuum.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So if you look at the international space station,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
The degree of vacuum outside is not as good as the vacuum in our lab.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
It's still vacuum.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
So this vacuum is basically

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
If the system is stable enough,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
The quantum is able to live for a few months.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
It's not a problem.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
We have a quantum.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
We caught this quantum once.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's been alive for about half a year.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
From September last year to March this year.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Until one time, one accident, it's gone.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
So it can live very long in this situation.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It won't interact with the background.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So it won't have a lot of strange noises.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Or it won't be affected by the outside environment.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Quantum computing needs these intangibles.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
It's very fragile.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
It's best to live in an environment where it doesn't interact with the outside world.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But we can manipulate it.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
How to manipulate it, I'll talk about it later.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
But it doesn't have any background interaction that we don't want.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
The second is that when you catch a bunch of quantum,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Every quantum looks the same.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You won't find that my quantum,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
For example, after my quantum, my quantum,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It's not the same as the other one.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Because quantum is essentially through nature.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Instead of through artificial production.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So we don't have to adjust the nature of each quantum.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Because if the nature of the quantum is different,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Then we have a big problem.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's the same for every one you catch.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
This also means that if we use this system to catch this quantum,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
We can use this system.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
If we use this system to catch and operate,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
We can use this whole system to deal with another quantum.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
It basically has no problem.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
We don't need to adjust each one or measure it.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Basically not necessary.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Another feature of quantum is that,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Because it is through the battery factory,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Every one has electricity.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
In the case that every one has electricity,

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Every one can directly auto or connect in the same trap.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
That is to say, if you catch 10 quantum today,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
You can directly let the first quantum and the tenth quantum have an entanglement.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
You don't have to say that I have to do this through 1, 2, 2, 3.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Because in theory, they are actually in this trap.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They can all see each other.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
This thing can make the complexity of quantum computing much lower.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
As long as you don't need a bunch of complicated quantum,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
You can make your experiment more accurate.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Because we all know that quantum computing is not perfect now.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
As long as you keep doing all kinds of quantum logic,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
You just let your error rate rise.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
Basically, the quantum computing of the quantum system is in this.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Because of these good qualities,

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Its quantum logic is in single qubit rotation.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
About 99.999 is not a difficult thing.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
In the case of 2-qubit, which requires entanglement,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
98 or 99 is not difficult to do in a normal lab.

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
It can be very easy to do very high quality in a small number of small systems.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
This is the characteristic of the quantum system.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
How do you do a lot of them?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
This is not the scope of our discussion today.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
We know that it is very good if it is small, there is no problem.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But there are hundreds of kinds of quantum.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We open the element cycle table and it looks like there are more than 100 kinds.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So why do we choose Eterbium?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
What are the benefits of Eterbium?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The first one is that if we look at it now,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
There is a hyperfine cube in the lower left corner.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
The place where we define 0 and 1 is here.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
What are the benefits of it?

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
This Eterbium 171,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Its nucleus is a spin half.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Its nucleus has a 1 in 2 spin.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
So the result is that it will produce a hyperfine cube.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
It is very natural, like a straight line or a straight line.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
So it is a hyperfine cube.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
The second is that if you kick off one electron,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
What is the layer of the outer chain?

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
So there are not many cases where you kick off the first one and it is full.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
So your first requirement is that if you want to have a hyperfine,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And then you want to kick off one electron,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The outer chain is full.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
At the same time, you also hope that in the process of your experiment,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Your nucleus will not go to any strange place.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
For example, if we put the nucleus here,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Through this experiment,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
It may have a part of the probability to get here.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
When it gets here, we'll figure out a way to kick it back.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
That is, we can kick it back through 935 and 638.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
You have to make sure that you can find your nucleus back to where it wants to be.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
You can initialize it to where you want it to be.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
This is quite important.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because you don't want to say that it has all kinds of good qualities,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
But after you do the experiment, you don't know what kind of strange state your nucleus has gone to.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Of course, another important point is that

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
You hope that the laser you do the experiment can be bought on the market,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Or at least it's not very exaggerated.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
For example, our laser here is 369 nm.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
If your laser is 500 to 1000 nm,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's very, very good.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That is to say, the range of visible light is very good.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Although 369 nm is already very close to the blue light,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It's a little bit of an outline, but it can still be done.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Whether or not you can do the experiment with a sold laser,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
It will also affect whether or not you can do a good amount of electricity.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
So you can express it in various ways.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
It meets a series of good qualities.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
It is a spin-1 in 2.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
After it kicks off an electricity,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The outer layer is full of electricity.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
Its various complex connections can be easily

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
We can simplify it to just look at the connection at the bottom left.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
As long as we have those auxiliary lasers,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It can be regarded as non-existent.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
At the same time, it mainly operates 369 nm.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
This frequency can be bought on the market.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
So why do we choose to use Ethereum?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Ethereum does not have a very long history.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It was probably around the 2010s

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
It was established by Chris Monore, a professor at the University of Maryland.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
It is to use Ethereum to use its 369 nm

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Transition to do all kinds of quantum computing operations.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
So why is Ethereum a good reason?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Let's talk about why the reason system is a good system.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Why is Ethereum a good reason?

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
After the two-step logic is completed,

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
But the reason system can only be a small system.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
If we want to simulate a large

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
What should we do if we need a lot of Hewlett-Packard space?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So the first simple way is to say

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Each of our particles has a spin-down and a spin-up

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
One 0 and one 1

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Then we can make it

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Let's just find a bunch of particles.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
We have n particles

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
So in this case, our total Hewlett-Packard space is 2n square.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Sounds good

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
But can we find a faster way?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Maybe there is

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Your particle is

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
In addition to the ability to pick up,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
The particle will vibrate.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Because we just said

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
We are using this

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
We are adding an AC power plant

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Let this particle be in vacuum

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Affected by this power plant

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Then after the back and forth vibration, the waiting price is restrained there.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
This means that the particle will vibrate.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
The vibration of this particle is also a quantum.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
In theory, you can put a quantum

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
You can put two

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
You can put three

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You can put n quantum

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
So you can put a lot of quantum in every quantum

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Theoretically, it is infinite.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
In practice, of course, it is limited.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
So the reason why my paper is said to be this

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
The reason for this SWAP test in Infinite Dimension is because

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
We are using a quantum

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
We are not using 0 and 1 as a calculation standard

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
What does this mean?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Look here

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
The mainstream approach

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
We can say that this is more common

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
We have a lot of 0s and 1s

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
A lot of 0s and 1s

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You are on the top of this side

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Then this kind of vibration

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It's like a bus

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Responsible for the information from the left to the right

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
It's like it's a

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
After you finish the calculation, you will be forgotten

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I want to hope that it is

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Not as a

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Support function

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
But what you have to think about is

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Every quantum has only two dimensions

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
But it contains this

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Continuous Variable

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Or its Vibration Normal

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Its vibration is an infinite dimension

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Can you turn their characters upside down?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
That is to say

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Let you

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
This part of the infinite dimension

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
It becomes a storage and calculation character for quantum computing

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Let this two-dimensional system

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
It becomes a quantum bus character

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
If you turn it upside down

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Maybe we can use the same system

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
But this can be done

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Can manipulate a lot of

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
It's a lot of quantum dimensions

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So this is possible

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Then there is another point

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
It's special to say

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Why do I seem to switch

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
This infinite dimension

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Interact with Continuous Variable

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Your infinite dimension

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
This matter is seen through its vibration

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
That is to say, one vibration, two vibrations

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It can go to the infinite dimension

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The reason for the Continuous Variable

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
This vibration

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
If you look at it with quantum

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It is in x and p space

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It is in the phase space

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Is a continuous situation

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So this infinite dimension

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
With this continuous variable

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
This matter is exactly the same

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It's not that I don't seem to get it

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Just

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
People in quantum will prefer to say

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It is x, it is infinite dimension

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But if you are from the light system today

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
You are doing quantum light

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
You might be saying

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
This is a continuous variable

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
OK

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
So now we know

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Can you open it?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
No problem

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I want to ask

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
That one of yours

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Motion state is also

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
The direction of x is still

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Is the direction of radio

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
This

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
We are all using the direction of radio

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
OK

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
We are not using X

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
OK

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Thank you

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
The main reason is because

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Our experiment is

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Need a few vibrational modes

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Interaction between

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Then X

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
If we pull to the front page

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
This is to say

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
You each

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
There will be three vibrations

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
But his three

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
There are two directions

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Is radio

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Is

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Is

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
You can say it is horizontal

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Then one is horizontal

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
So you use this

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Horizontal vibration

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
He has more

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
He has more

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
He can also choose

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
We won't choose

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Like here

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
The two he drew here

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Both are

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
X

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
But we don't use these two

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
These two are just memories

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
We use radio

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Correct

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
OK

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
So

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Is it because of radio

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
His ability to separate

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Probably with his weight

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Separate

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
The range is probably where

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Is there

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Probably all in

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Kilohertz

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Megahertz

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Radio

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Probably up to

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
0.5 or up to 5

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
It is possible

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Then generally speaking

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
X will be smaller

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Because

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
X it is not

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
X it is from that

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Cap to confine

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
It is clamped by two electrons

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Generally speaking

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
We

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Uh

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Our X

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
His

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
His

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Frequency

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
His that

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
His frequency is smaller

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Correct

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Of course this is not

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Why don't we choose him

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
The reason is right

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Correct

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Understand

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
So simply put

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Say yes

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
OK

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
So simply put

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Just pull it back

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Just say good

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
We now know this

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
This computer

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
To do it with a microscope

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Very good

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
But the speed of ether

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Maybe there is no

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
This kind of vibration

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Better

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
So we decided to use

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Vibration of ether

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
To do experiments

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
After that

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
We want to say

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Then we have to make sure

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
He can do quantum computers

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Is the quantum computer

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Is a series of requirements

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
First

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
You have to make sure you can

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Your quantum information

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
The subset can be more and more

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
For example

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
If your spin has 2

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
You can find

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
For example, more

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Two spins

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You can find a very large

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Kilohertz

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
You can find a very large

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
This quantum space

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
This thing

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Can be done in spin

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
That in quantum information

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
In this

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Of course I can do it too

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
So theoretically

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
We can catch

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
A vibration

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
You can catch two

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Vibration of ether

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You can catch

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
You can catch a vibration

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
This quantum

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
You can catch two

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
You can catch three

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
So he

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Scalable

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
The first one is fine

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
The second

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
He can last a long time

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Coherence time

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
He must not

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
He must not be easy

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
It's easy to interact with the outside world

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
This thing

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
In spin

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Can last

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Ten minutes

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
This is a pretty exaggerated world record

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
What about the vibration

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
It can only last about

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Ten to twenty milliseconds

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
One millisecond

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Is one thousandth of a second

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
But it's been a long time

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Because our experiment

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Faster than this

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
The rest is more standard

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That's what we want

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Can we go

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Effectively go to this

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Put it

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Initialization in a certain place

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
I said we hope

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
When we start

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
We can know where he is

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
So we do

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
All kinds of operations

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
That's how it will be

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
To the place we want to go

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Of course you

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
You can put it

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
To a certain place

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Let him

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
After all kinds of operations

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
You have to be able to read it

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
How can you read it

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
The answer is also

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Is

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Initialization skills

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
And reading skills

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Use spin

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
To read

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
This

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
With spin

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
With continuous

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
It's the same

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
This technology

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
In

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
This technology

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
In this

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Whether you use this

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
It's the same

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
The real point is

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Is that

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Can you find the middle one

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Can operate

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Vibration

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
That kind of logic

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
How do you make logic

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Or the most difficult place

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
OK

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
So let's go to the next place

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I want to see

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
That is to say

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
In the case of QB

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
We see the logic

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
You may see it more often

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That is to say

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
We have a single QB

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
We can turn it

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
At the beginning

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
QB is like a

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
North and south

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
This

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
If the North Pole is 0 and the South Pole is 1

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
You can see above

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Turn around on the surface

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
The first one is

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
If you have only one

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Just turn it

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
If you can do it

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Any quantum state

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
You have to be able to do

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Any quantum

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
This

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
This

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
This

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
If you need this result

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
You also need one

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Can control two

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
quantum

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
What about our common practice

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That is

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
This is the first one

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Is this controlled

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Then the second one

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Is controlled

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
You can do

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
If the first one is 0

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
The first one is 0

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
If the second one is 0

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
It's still 0 0

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
That's his logic

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
It's a simple output

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
This situation

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
QB is the quantum

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
In the binary system

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Can do this

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
What if we have a

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
What if we have an infinite system

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
So we have the situation on the right

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Like this

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Single QB

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
It corresponds to a series of

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
All kinds of different things

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
What is this

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Displacement

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Rotation

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Squeeze in

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Bean splitter

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
These

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
It corresponds to this single QB

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
This

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
You can say

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Continuous

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Continuous

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
These basic

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
This is the basic tool

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
But it needs a

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Very important point

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
The most difficult thing is

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
If you want to do this

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Non-linear

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
If you want to do that

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Can let

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Between the two

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
To produce

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
This is

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
This is

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
This is the trouble

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
So the next point

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
We have to say

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Okay, then we

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Which one do we choose

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
To do this

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
We have to choose

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Control swap gate

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
What about the control swap gate

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
There are three quantum

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
The first one is spin

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Is our

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Quantum box

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
There is a quantum behind

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
There is a quantum behind

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
It's called A

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
There is a quantum called B

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
it is good

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
If you go through this

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Control swap

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
It if this

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
It if this middle

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
This quantum

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
This spin

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
This box

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
It belongs to

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Spin down

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It won't

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
It won't do any action

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
But if it spins up

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
It can put two quantum

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Exchange

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
It's very simple

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
If today

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Your indicator

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
If it's down

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
No action

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
If the indicator is up

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Exchange

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It seems to be very specific, right?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Of course what to do

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
If you today

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
You have this very simple

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
this

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Gate is that you can do this

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Howdermann

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
this

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
If you spin the spin

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Then you do it at the same time

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
This is a swap

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
gate

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
You can get

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
You can get these two

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Unknown quantity

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
How similar it is

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
But attention

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
You don't need to know the quantity

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
It doesn't have to know

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Quantity B

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
You go straight to measure

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
This quantum box

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
You can find these two

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
you

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
You get these two

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Quantity

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
How similar it is

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
That's right

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
So this

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
So this

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
This

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
He can give us this

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
This circuit

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
It means

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
We can

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
We can now

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Unknown two

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
The details

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
In the case of details

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
But you know

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
How similar these two

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
How similar it is

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
This is actually very good

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Because that is to say

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Sometimes we are just curious

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Our results

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
For example, the two of them

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Is it

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Similar quantum

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
But we

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
For its details

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Maybe not so much

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
But the previous situation was

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
You might want to know first

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
What does A look like

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
What does B look like

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
To know how similar A and B are

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
But you can now

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
It's very simple

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Just know how similar it is

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
And you don't need to know

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
What are their details

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
OK

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Ok

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Then next

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Then next

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
This

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
In theory, we need

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
This is very simple

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
This

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
We need this

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Complex control swap gate

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
It involves

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
One

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Spin and two

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
Motional mode

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Two oscillators

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
That

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
In theory

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
That's what it was like in 2001

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
But in practice

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
It's not that simple

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Because we have something in practice

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
It's called the control bin splitter gate

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
It's very similar to the control swap gate

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
But it's not the same

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What's the difference

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
You'll find out

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
If you use the middle one now

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
This

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
If you use Hamiltonian for evolution

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
You put X and Y

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
It will turn into Y and X

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
That's right

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
But there's one more thing in front of it

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Very annoying to us

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
This

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
This face

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
This

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
This

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Uh

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
This face is here

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Because we know

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
The quantum world

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
It's a negative number

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
So of course it can produce this

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
This kind of virtual

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
This face is here

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
We need to find a way

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Get rid of this face

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
When it only becomes X and Y

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
It becomes Y and X

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
No need Y and X

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Plus a very annoying face

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
How do you do this

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
The answer is that we need three gates

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
We need three modes

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
We put what we want

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
This measurement thing

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Ready in mode B and mode C

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
And then we let mode B and mode A

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Interact

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Let mode A and mode C interact

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Its final result will be mode B

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Interact with mode C

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
But its face

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
This face will be miraculously eliminated

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
So you only need two

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Control beam splitter

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And then you have three modes

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
You can do it

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Just now we said

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
We really want to see this

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
We can know

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
How similar are the two quantum states

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
But

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Uh

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
But you don't need to know

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
The details of these two quantum states

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Of course, a very important point

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
No matter how complicated these two quantum states are

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The measurement process is the same

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It's the same time

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
You're not going to say

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
My quantum state is bigger

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So I'm going to need more steps

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
No need

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
The quantum state may require more steps

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
But whether the two quantum states are similar

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
This thing

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
It is a constant deep circuit

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Its length is stable

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
OK

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
This thing is pretty important

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Because it

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
This thing is far more than this

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
SPIN system

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Uh, efficiency

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Of course, its

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Its fidelity will not be higher

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Because this is a relatively new system

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
It will have all kinds of infidelity

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
You'll see later

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Where is it imperfect

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
So

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
It's very simple

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
We only need two control bin splitters

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
With three modes

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
We can get this

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
We just

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Hope to get this

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The core of this

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Control swap gate

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
OK

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Can I ask a question?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Good question

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Because I don't know much about this system

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So can you tell me a little bit

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Physically

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
How did you do it?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Control bin splitter gate

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Uh

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
I'm going to the next page

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Ok

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Ok, I'm going to the next page

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
The next page is physics

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
We just said so much

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
It's like you said

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
What can you do with a Hamiltonian

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
What kind of result will it have

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
What is its physical situation

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Very simple

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
We now

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
I just

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Uh

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Every

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Every particle is in

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
It's in

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Every particle is in

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
There will be a vibration in the z direction

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
There will be two vibrations in the x and y direction

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Then we said we need three vibration states

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
So we can only use the x and y direction at this time

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
We caught two

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
After the particle

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It's in the x and y direction

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
There are four vibrations in total

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
We used three of them

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Called Moe ABC respectively

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
What about this Moe ABC

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
What if we go at the same time

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Uh

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
If you apply this Moe AB and AC

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
That is to say

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
If we have this

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
If we laser this

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Bichrome

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
That is to say

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
We applied this laser

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
It has

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
We applied the laser

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
It's not a single frequency

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
It's two frequencies

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
And if it's between the two frequencies

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
The interval is this

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
380kHz

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Or 490kHz

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
It can

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
It can

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
It can successfully go

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Drive

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Just what we want

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
This one

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Control beam speed

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
What is control beam speed

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
That is to say

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
I let

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
One more x

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Then let b less than one

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
This concept

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
So

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
You just let your

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
This frequency driving is

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Difference

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
It's

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
It's the difference between the two modes

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It will automatically become

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Like the one we just had

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
This control

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
This situation

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
So our physical system

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Is that we catch two particles

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Let him use it

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
There are four vibration

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Choose three of them

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
And then

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Let one of the particles

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
It's in a special state

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It won't interact with our experiment

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
It simply contributes to the vibration

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
It won't

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Contribute to its

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
This energy level

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
It's just

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I can't see it going somewhere else

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
What about the last one that I can see

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Let's go

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Let's go

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Use this

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
This post laser to drive it

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Do this

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Control beam speed

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
This thing

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
OK

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Then

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
We have this mode

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
ABC

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
What about this mode ABC

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
We are not going to turn ABC now

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
We are going to turn

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
The difference between AB and AC

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
OK

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
So

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
If you do this

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Then we can get

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Control beam speed

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Then we stack it up

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Use that logic to put it

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
We use that

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Just stack it up

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
We will get

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
We want this

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
The final result

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
This is our swap task

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
That

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
This experiment system

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
That is to say

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
The gate time we need in total is

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
1.2 milliseconds

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Then we have this

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
It's 10 to 20

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
That is to say

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Theoretically, we can operate

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
10 to 20

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
After the gate

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
It will only

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
There are all kinds of problems

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
But in fact

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
I can't do it for so long

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
The reason is because

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Ah

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Our state preparation

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
That is, when we are preparing

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Those vibrations

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
There will be a lot of

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Error

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
How to say

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
That is to say

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
We are now

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
We are now in this 0

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
0 and 0

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Come to this

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
When this stacks up

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
This overlap

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
It is 80% of this

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Overlap, that's right

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
But if you take 5 and 5 today

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
If you do the overlap

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Its overlap rate is about 50%

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
The main reason

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
It says here that

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
There is a possibility that our

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
This state

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
This preparation

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
It's hard to do well

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Of course, one reason is because

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
As your time goes up

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Just follow your

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
When this phonon mode increases

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
His

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Ah

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
The coherence time will be shorter

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Then his heating rate

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
May be bigger

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
That is to say

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
As your mode

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
When going up

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
He has all kinds of imperfections

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So even if your

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Even if your coherence time is long enough

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Coherence time is not now

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
The bottleneck of this experiment is right

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
OK

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
So that means we are now

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Overlap 0 and 0

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Great, he saw his 80%

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Then 1 and 1 overlap

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
2 and 2 overlap

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
3 and 3 overlap

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
4 and 4, 5 and 5 overlap

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
No problem

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
But you want to say

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Overlap 0 and 0 and 1 and 1

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
This thing

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
It doesn't seem to be very quantum

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Can you overlap 0 plus 1

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Or 0 minus 1

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
This thing

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
The answer is of course

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
So our practical approach is

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
We have a 0 plus 1

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Then fix it

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Then we prepare another state

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
He can run from 0 minus 1 to 0 plus 1

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Along the

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Along the

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Along the

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Along the

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Along the

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Just follow that 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1, 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Run around

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
But what about the situation

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Let's find this overlap

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
It will become very overlap

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Then it becomes very non-overlap

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Then it becomes very overlap

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Then it becomes non-overlap

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
So this thing is what we see

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
We can

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
We can not only fold

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
This

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
We can fold

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
So we can now put a

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Fold it up

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
But you can't fold a simple one

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
He also wants to say

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Then we can fold different things

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Of course we can

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
We can not

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
We are now preparing a coherent state here

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Then we will

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
We just sweep it like a radar

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Sweep a circle

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Sweep a circle

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Sweep a circle

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
It means that you can imagine

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
This one

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Like a

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Like a plane

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Or a submarine

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Then we sweep it like a sonar

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Sweep a circle

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
So this sonar picture

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
So this sonar picture

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
The result is

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Its overlap

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
One circle one circle

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
We will see

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Basically your coherent state

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
It's really here

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Just this

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
There is no problem with this sonar

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yes

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Then at the same time

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
If you put this circle in the middle

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Is

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
The length is root number 3

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Take out this circle

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
If you take out the slices

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
You will find

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
It overlaps

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It's actually not bad

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
It overlaps here

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
In fact, there are still 80%

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
About 70-80%

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
So this is

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
We can really see this

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Overlap two coherent states

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
This is two

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Two coherent states

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
It's not bad

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
But I want to say

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Can we do more

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
The answer is actually yes

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
That is, we are now preparing

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Squeeze state

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
That is

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
This is also in the coherent state

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
A state that is common

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
We can put it

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
This

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
It

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
You can imagine

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
We

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
When we go up along R

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It this

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Its squeeze state

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Will become narrower and narrower

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
It will be squeezed more and more

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
It will be squeezed more and more

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Like a

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
It's getting more and more elliptical

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
So it's at the bottom

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
When this circle

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
It's very close to the circle

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
That two circles

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
If the center of the circle is overlapping

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
And then you turn it

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's basically a complete overlap

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
You see here

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
It's close to 1, that's right

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
But as you do it now

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It's getting more and more elliptical

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
You let the two elliptical

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
When the core is overlapping

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It finally becomes more and more like

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
It's just

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
It's just

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
When overlapping

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
It just turned to the right position

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
It overlaps

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
In the middle of this place

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Other places

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Other places you will see

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
It's basically black

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
So we can be sure

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
We can overlap this

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
0 plus 1, 0 minus 1

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
And overlap all kinds of Fox

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
We can overlap

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Squeeze and overlap

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
This Cohedron

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
it is good

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
So this is physically

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
We solved this

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
We successfully obtained

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Control

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
Binslip gate

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
Can get a control swap

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Get these interesting things

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
That's us

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
This is my paper

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
The content is that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
We can actually do this

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
That

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Of course you want to say

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
That this thing sounds like

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
There seems to be no quantum calculation

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Or what quantum calculation

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It's just more physical

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
The practical way is to say

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
If you can overlap

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
If you have two quantum

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
You can

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
You can think of two quantum

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
It's two

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Two quantities

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Because we all know that quantum

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
It's 0

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Quantum plus one

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Quantum minus two

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Quantum

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
This plus one third

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
A three-quantum or so

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
So

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
The next step is to say

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Can you make it

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
It becomes like two quantities

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
To overlap

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Overlap two quantities

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
This thing is

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
This one

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
We all know that linear times

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Overlap two quantities

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
The whole computer science

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Is also the beginning of machine learning

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
So we

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
So our next experiment is

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
We go through

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
This one

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
We go through

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
This control bin

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
With some other

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
More skills

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
We started to want to do some

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Things about quantum mechanics

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
But today

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I stopped at

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Control swap gate

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
It is indeed possible

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Overlap two unknown quantum states

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And its complexity

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
The complexity of its own experiment

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
It won't follow

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
You have to prepare

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
It will rise

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Yeah, that's about it

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Yeah

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
OK, so that's about it

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Uh

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
OK, that's it

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Let's see what the problem is

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Because I know I'm talking

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
More

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
It will be faster

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Because I think

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Uh

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Just cover the whole

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
More general background part

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
And then cover

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
For example, the part that is more theoretical

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
And then at the end

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
It really belongs to us

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
This part of the experiment

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
So the overall content

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
May be more

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
So if you are interested in any part

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
You can ask me directly

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Thank you all

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Thank you, Kewei

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
OK

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Does anyone have any questions?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
We can just pull it back

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Let's see what the problem is

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
That is

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
The front is actually not too special

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Just some

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Background part

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Because I think

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Maybe some people

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Not doing quantum manipulation

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Just take it all out

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
OK

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Yeah

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So this is very physical

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
There is basically nothing here

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Part of the quantum information

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Because that's another one

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Right

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I want to ask a question myself

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Just

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
That one

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
I actually haven't studied this

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Continuous

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
What is it called?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Continuous variable

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Continuous variable

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Yes yes

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
This thing with

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Just the general

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That kind of quantum gate

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Is there anything different?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
And they can

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Do the same thing

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Or

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Can you explain a little

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Just

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Ok

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
That is to say

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
We know this

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Dimensional

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
That is to say

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
If you enter this quantum computer

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
He can do

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Just

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Do you have a way to use

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
We all know that

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Uh

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Two-dimensional system can do anything

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Quantum

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Uh

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
In your two-dimensional system

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
You only need single qubit rotation

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
With ckn

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
You can do any quantum calculation

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Is this thing

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Continuous variable

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
That is to say

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
You are today

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
For example

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Can he do this thing

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Is

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
The fifth point here

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
This

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
This

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
This

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
He proved

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
You only need

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
You

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
You need these things above

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
With one

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
X and P

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Separate

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
He

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
You need a bigger than X

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Square or P square

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
This type

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
You can do

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Any of this

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
You can simulate any of this

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Uh

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Hamiltonian

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
You can do any quantum calculation

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
That is to say

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
What is continuous variable

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
That is to say

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Uh

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
You can think of continuous variable

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Is

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Light

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
In the phase space

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
X and P

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
That is

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
That's what I mentioned later

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
This

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
This is here

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
He is an X and P

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Then why is he a continuous variable

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Because you can put this quantum

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Put it in this

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Anywhere in the space

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
That is

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Uh

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
You can put this thing in the space

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Anywhere

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
He is a continuous variable

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
You can prepare this vibration today

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
To this side

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
This side

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
This side

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
This side

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
He is here

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
But you can also think of it

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
This space

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
He is

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Uh

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
These vibrations

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Or these coherent states

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
It can become

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Zero phonon

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
One phonon

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Two phonons

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Three phonons

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
So these two symbols are equal

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
You can express it as

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
The distribution inside the phase space

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
You can also express it as

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
He is a variety of phonons

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Superposition of phonons

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
These two are equal

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Oh

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Comparison value

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
In fact, it is the quantum optics

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Put the photon into the phonon

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
That's right

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Yes, that's right

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
It's two

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
The mathematical structure is exactly the same

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Just quantum optics

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
People will love to say

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
X and P

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
But like this

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
But people who do quantum mechanics

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Say we see one

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
One by one

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
That is

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
So we like to say

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Infinite dimension

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
So

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
This page

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
I think the point is

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Uh

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Wait a minute

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Here

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
So here

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
I will say

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
It is continuous

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Variable quantum information

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
But you look at the picture

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
It's actually not continuous

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
It's obvious in the picture

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
It is

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
It's infinite dimension

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
That's right

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
So these two are equal

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Just

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Because the tool is different from the system

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
So the language used is not the same

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Yes

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
So continuous variable

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
This word must have appeared earlier

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Because quantum mechanics

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Maybe there was in the 1980s

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
But infinite dimension

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
So we do quantum mechanics

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Will use

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Because it is

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
More fancy

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Theoretically, the vibration of infinite dimension

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Because

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
It's like your x and p in theory

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Like a vacuum

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Can be pulled to infinity

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
In practice, of course, it can't be pulled that far

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
But it is theoretically infinite

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
OK

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
understand

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Yes

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Then

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Sorry

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
OK

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
I understand now

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
What I want to do

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
But I want to understand again

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
That

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
What is this

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Con

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
What is this

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Control beam

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Control beam splitter

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yes

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
That is to say

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
When you just said

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Our

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
OK

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Our purpose is simple

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
That is to say

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Our purpose is to get control beam splitter

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
But our physical system

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Can you give us control beam splitter directly

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
It can't give us control beam splitter directly

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
It also gives us a very close

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Control beam splitter

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
It can give us

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
That is to say

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Oh

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
But one point is that

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
The picture we drew here is in z-basis

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
That is

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
G and E

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
But we can get it in practice

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Is in x-basis

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
But this is a small detail in practice

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
We ignore it first

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
That is to say

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Here is x-basis

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
But the point is

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
After you get this Hamiltonian today

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
You throw it down

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
The result of it running is

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
In addition to being able to swap

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
It will get a

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
In the process of swapping

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Like

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Why do you say that

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
You imagine

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
You see your light

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
After the reflection on the glass

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
It's beam splitter

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
After the reflection on the glass

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
It will get a fragrance

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
You put a light on the glass today

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
It will get a fragrance

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
So this thing is completely reasonable

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
That is to say

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Because

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
This Hamiltonian

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
In fact, it is the Hamiltonian of beam splitter

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It will naturally get the feature of beam splitter

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
That is to say

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
You hit this

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
You hit this

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
On the beam splitter

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
It will get a fragrance

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
We have to kill this fragrance

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Otherwise

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
We can't get this

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Swap gate

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
That's right

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
So we kill this fragrance

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
The approach is

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Let's put things in B first

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Then B and C do something first

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Then put

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
B and A do an action first

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Let A and C do an action

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
We can wait

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Kill it

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
As for why this thing

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
It will be like this

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Anyway

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
This thing is

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
In 2020

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
It's been a long time since someone discovered this thing in math

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I want to ask

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
How is it done physically?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
That is physically

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Why

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Beam splitter gate

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
You mean

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Why this

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Or why

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
You use two lasers

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
After hitting

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Why is it

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Will be a very similar

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Very similar to swap gate

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
What I'm asking is the experiment

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
OK

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Why in practice

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
In fact, the obvious reason is because

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Can you go to the next page

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
OK

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Is it in this page?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Yes

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
That is

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
It's pretty obvious

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
That is to say

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
If you know what is blue sideband and red sideband

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Blue sideband

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Hit it

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
It's sigma plus and A

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
You know this

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
That is

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
That is

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Let me see if I can draw it here

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
I should be able to draw a picture

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Let me see

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
OK

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
If we are in this today

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This thing

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
We

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
If you just hit one

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
It will become sigma plus

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
And

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
A

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
OK

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
That is to say

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
So if we are now

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
OK

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Then add cc

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Anyway, I don't draw cc

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
That

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
You want to say

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Can we reach a higher level

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Is the second order sideband

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
That is

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
We know we can do sigma plus A

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Sigma plus B

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Sigma plus C

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
But if we do it today

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Sigma plus

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
A

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
B plus

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Then we add

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Sigma

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Minus

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
A

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
B

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Plus

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Then add cc

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Just add that complex conjugate

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Ignore it

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
That is

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Then there is cc

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
In this case

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
When you combine these two items

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Sigma plus plus sigma minus is sigma x

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
So it will automatically become

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Sigma x

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
A plus B

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
That is

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
You drive two second-order sidebands

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
It will become

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Control beam speaker

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
That is

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
That is to say

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Because

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
We know that in terms of food

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
You are going through this

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
That is

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
You are you are

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
When you expand that

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Lanadaiki parameter

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Can allow all kinds of

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
All kinds of interactions

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
You don't just open carrier

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Just

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
It's not just a sideband

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
You can go all the way up

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Right

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Which day is this thing

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Paper

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
It is

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
This is it

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I think this is still

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Oh that's it

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
This one

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
This is the theoretical basis of the experiment

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
It should be said that it is the experimental

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Toolbox

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I think the theoretical basis is how to say

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
What is the theoretical basis of the experiment

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
The theoretical basis of the experiment is

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
You can say that the theoretical basis

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
The point is this

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
That is to say we

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
If we want to measure

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
If this is the case

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
That's 2001

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Some people say

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Hey

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
In theory, if you have this gate

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
We can do this

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Then this is great

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Correct

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Then we can do this

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Right

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
That

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
The reason why this thing is done

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
I

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
I think the reason why this thing is done

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
It can be said that the one just now is right

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
But

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Oh

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
This one

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
This should be 2017

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
2016

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Right

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
But the problem is coming

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
You get it through that one

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
It's called control

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
It's called control

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
It's called control

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
How to integrate

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
It's called control

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
It's called control

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
It's called control

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
It's called control

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
This one

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
2001

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Or in 2002

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
2001

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
It is said that someone

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
In theory

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Do this thing

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
But in practice

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
By 2016

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
17 years

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Just come out

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
This is what it is

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Right

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Really

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
So

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
It is how to integrate

54:10.000 --> 54:10.000


54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
This is reasonably early

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Someone picked it up

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Of course

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't know where it is

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I didn't find out until I found this

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Otherwise

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Then I thought

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Because

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Our time is

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Paper of 2018

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Is to do control

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
But then I thought

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
How to do the next step

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
I don't want to say

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
We should do cswap

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
But how to do

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
I don't know

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Because I want to say

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
That waste time

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Can't be eliminated

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Then I thought

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Someone said he already thought

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
How to eliminate

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
That is to do it on the experiment

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Then write a model

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
It proves that it works

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Then do it

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Right

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
It is a

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Quite a lot

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Background process

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
That's right

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
So

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
It's just that you simply say

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
How to do control

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Hit two lasers

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
The frequency difference between it

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
490 respectively

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
380 or 490 respectively

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
It will become a

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Control

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Control

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
But

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
why

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Two

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Control

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Combine

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Can become a cswap

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
This thing

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
It's not that obvious

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Right

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Need a little math

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Right

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Right

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Then

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Let's

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Right

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Right

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
The omega ab

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Is

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Above

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Omega b

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Omega c

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Omega a

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Right

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Right

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Then omega

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
ac

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Omega c

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Omega a

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Right

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
That's right

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
I want to ask

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Just like

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
We look at this

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Mode

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
abc

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
Obviously

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
b and c

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Feel like

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Orthogonal

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
But

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Your side

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
a and b

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
a and c

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Is it orthogonal to each other?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
These are all normal mode

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
All normal mode

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
He is

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Orthogonal

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
One

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Orthogonal

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
OK

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Because normal mode

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
It's you

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
You solve it

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Between them

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
There is no linear

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Dependent relationship

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Right

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Understand

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Then you said before

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
You choose

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
ab

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
With ac

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
The two

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Interaction

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Hey

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
What is it

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Special reasons

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Like

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
In

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
You are in the front page

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
The first slide

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
There

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
You can choose

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
a b a c

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Right

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
You ask

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
OK

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
This is the reason for choosing

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
That is to say

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Mode c is coherent

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
We look

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Let's look at it from this page

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
That is to say

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
You will find mode a and mode b

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Is a

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
It's all face

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
The two of them

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
Vibration direction is opposite

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
That is

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
You will find

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Although they are both

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
One vibrates in the y-direction

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
One vibrates in the x-direction

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
They are both anti-vibration

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Only mode c is the same vibration

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
What will happen

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
The problem is

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
The coherence time of mode c

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Is the shortest

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
The shortest

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Because you vibrate in the same direction

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Easy to get noise

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
With all kinds of strange effects

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
So the coherence time of mode c

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
The shortest

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
So compare it

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
We have to

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
Let a and b interact first

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Then let

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Then let c come up at the end

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
This is what we found

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
This kind of performance is better

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
That is

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
A mode and b mode

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Is a better mode

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
So we let it do

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
After the thing

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Then let c come up at the end

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Right

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
This is

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Why

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Because he

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
He

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
He

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
He

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
He

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Because he

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
These modes

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
The

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Coherence time

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Is determined by what

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Not the same

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
He

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
A big part

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
A big part

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Is either out of phase

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Or in-phase

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Is

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Tonight

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
The

57:27.000 --> 57:28.500
Vibration

57:28.500 --> 57:30.000
K2 rotation

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Is a vertical vibration

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
K2 rotation

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Is an inront vibration

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Now this mode c

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Is an index vibration

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
It's so vibrant

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Is

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
When this particle

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Moves to this side

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
This one would move there

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
But if we use mode b and mode a

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
So

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Compared to

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
If you have a noise outside

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
When it comes

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
A and b basically

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Will not be affected

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
But c will be affected

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
So c coherence time

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
The shortest

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
This is why we

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Of course there is a d

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
But we later chose

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Just choose to use a b c

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Just ignore it

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
We use a b and a c

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
To do this action

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
So

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
So we

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
You say sorry first

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
We are in our time

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
That is to say

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Our a

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
b this

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Bitter

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
The particle is better than a c

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Because a and b are all good modes

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
a c has a mode

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
So

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
It's better

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
That's right

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Assuming another d

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
It's a bit like

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Mode a

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
But it's the same vibration

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Yes that's right

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
That's it

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
OK OK

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Then that one

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
The coherence is also very bad

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
It's not good

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
The reason it's worse

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
It's the same as what you just explained

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Yes

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
So it's the same

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
It's the same

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Understand

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
It's the same

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
If it is in phase vibration

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
It's easier to pick up all kinds of noise

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Then it's easy to pick up noise

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Because

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
It's hard for us to find a source

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Is

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
In such a small space

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
It actually kicked in two directions

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
So you assume

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
You suddenly have a burst coming today

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
Or you have one today

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Your this

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Your this

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
If source has a noise

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
When it comes

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
It

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Maybe

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Oh

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Understand

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
It's just

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
It's just

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
It has a negative effect on mode c

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
But it doesn't affect a and b

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Basically

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Because a and b are opposite

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
It's impossible to be in this direction

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Give you two opposite kicks

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
It's not possible

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
It's not possible

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
So

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
So

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
This noise source

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
It's with his special

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Because he's in

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
His mode

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
This one

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Is it related

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Is

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Because of his

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
On the space

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Really in position

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
And really

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Cause his

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Is the source of this noise

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
You can think of it as

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
He is today

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
He is in

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Uh

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
He's in

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
He's like a swing

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Such a positive direction

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
And then if you have one today

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
If the wave of Sinusoid comes

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
It will be kicked

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
It will be accelerated or decelerated

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
But

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
If you compare today

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
You suddenly have a Sinusoid in your space

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
This one

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
EM wave

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
But it doesn't affect mode a and mode b

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Because

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
He can't drive him

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
He can't

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
He can't

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
He can't increase his phonon

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah yeah yeah

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Really

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
OK

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Oh

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
His energy won't be like this

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
OK

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So interesting

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Oh

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yeah

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This is

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
This is the details of the experiment

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's in this place

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
That's right

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Why do we

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Don't choose ABC

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Because this is the best choice

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yeah

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I can ask a little bit

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That's what you didn't mention

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
That's the readout part

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Is there

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
OK

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Our readout part is

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Uh

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Our

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
The real readout in the experiment

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Is that we actually

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
It's just a spin

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You see here

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
The readout is only on this side

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
We can do it

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
We

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
We can do it

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Readout b and c

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
but

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Our

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The selling point of this experiment is that

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
We are constant dips

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Then we don't need

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Measure b and c

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But in fact

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
If you really prepared a state

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
How do you measure it

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You go

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You just go straight to drive

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
This

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Read the sideband

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Then look at his fit

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Just

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
You just go straight to drive

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
His sideband

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Then look at him

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
0, 1, 2, 3

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
This thing can be done directly

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But we don't want to do this either

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
We just want to go straight

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Look at the spin

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You can see how similar b and c are

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
This is the goal of our experiment

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
In fact

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
In fact, here

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Say this

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Measurement

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That is to say

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's very standard

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Uh

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
This is the same as the general

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's the same as the general

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Just

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Just use this

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
State detection

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Then

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
You can use the sideband to see how much he has

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Phonon in

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
In

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
In each number ratio

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Right

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Um

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Understand

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh, there's another one

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I just mentioned this

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I said this is 1.2 seconds, right?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
If you find out

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
You'll find this

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The first one here is how long his gay time is

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
His whole paten's gay time

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
The paten here is his

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
His paten is only half paten

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But his face is different

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Let's ignore the face now

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Don't look

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
You'll find that he's longer here

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It's shorter here

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Because we know this

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
A and B are all good

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So A and B

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It takes a longer time

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
He's less likely to happen

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
There's a problem with A and C

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So he

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
We only gave him half the time

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That is

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We know we have to

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
One control

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Is running full paten

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The other one is running half paten

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Then we put

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The better one is running full paten

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So this part here

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
It takes 0.8 milliseconds

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
This is 0.4

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So 0.8

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Divided by 0.4

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
0.8 plus 0.4

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So 0.8 is here

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is the number

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That's right

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Does anyone else have any questions?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I think

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like you

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Sorry

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Ted, please ask

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Sorry

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I have a lot of questions

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
This

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I'm just going to ask this picture

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You just stopped here

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
He

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Stay here

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
His this

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
M12345

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
His this

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You have a picture later

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
He is

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Is he a coherent state?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
In Fonin's

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Spectrum

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
He's a coherent state

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
This

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Here we are

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Prepare

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Fog

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Fog

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Then let it overlap

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But because of our

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Fog

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I can't prepare well

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
In a very high Fonin

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The difference in performance here

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's not our

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Control

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The difference in performance

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It's because we can't

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
A very good one

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Fog

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Five

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
The state is right

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
OK

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So he's not a state preparation

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The problem

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He is

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
He is

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
He is

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
The problem

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I see

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
We did it later

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
We did all kinds of simulations

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
What does it include

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
We found

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
In

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
When n is equal to 5

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
If the state preparation is perfect

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Plus all kinds of noise

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
With all kinds of problems

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
His Fog

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It should be 90%

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Even if n is equal to 5

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But we see here

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
In fact, his Fog

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
It's about 50%

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The middle

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Most of the problems are in

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
State preparation

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That's right

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I see

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Thank you

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
This is where you can do

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Overlap

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And then this is where you can do

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
This

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Coherent state

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That's right

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I think the radar map is still

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It looks pretty interesting

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
This radar map

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's actually a circle

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
That's what we

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Every experiment is to draw a circle

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And then draw it

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
The place of the circle

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
In

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
It's a beautiful radar map

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And then he

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That's it

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Here

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And then

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You'll always see

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
There's a

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It's not a beautiful place

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
This is what we found

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
That's right

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
You think you only drive

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
One direction

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Coherent state

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's not

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The experiment is not so perfect

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
He's going in the opposite direction

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
A little bit of stuff

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
That's right

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So here's a little bit

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
It looks like that

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
The dirty stuff is here

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That's

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
That's existence

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That's right

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And then here

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We don't draw radar maps

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Because this thing

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Its

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
The form of expression

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
This is better

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
How did you generate that

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
That's Omega A and Omega B

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Omega AB and Omega

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
AC

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I remember you said

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You use Pulse Laser

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
That's right

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Pulse Laser, for example, is

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
After a frequency

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
How do we operate it

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That is, we let it pass through AOM

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
After you pass through AOM

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You can

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You can operate the frequency of AOM

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It will

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It will shift to different places

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That's right

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
That is, we use AOM to

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
To control the frequency of the laser

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That is

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The whole laser

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It might be

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
For example, 369.58

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Something like that

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Assuming this number

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Then you want it to become

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
369.58 plus 380kHz

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Then you let your AOM

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Have

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
You just let your AOM shift it

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It will

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It will shift away

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
OK

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
In fact, this

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Of course it's a whole

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
A whole laser thing

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But we're talking about it now

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's all

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It's all good

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's okay

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
That's right

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Let me confirm it again

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
This thing is

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Your Pulse Laser

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Your Pulse Laser

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
How long is it

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Three hundred

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Three hundred and sixty something

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Three hundred

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Three hundred

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Or 370

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It should be 375 times

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
This number

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I'm going to check it out

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Because

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I remember more

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's 369

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Because that is

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Static connection will be needed

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
No, no

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That is

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
We

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
What do you think

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
He asked

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
He may

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Jason may be asking you

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
That Pulse Laser

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Pulse Width

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
How much

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes, yes, yes, Pulse Width

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
What is it

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You mean

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Oh, we're Pico Second

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I forgot how many Pico Seconds

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
OK

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
You mean

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
You mean time is right

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
OK

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yes, yes, yes

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We're pretty standard

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But I forgot

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I forgot how many Pico Seconds

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I remember his time scale

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's right there

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Uh-huh

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Right

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Uh-huh

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Right

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Uh-huh

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I don't really understand this

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
You are a

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You are a

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Pico Second Laser

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Pico Second Laser

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Then its bandwidth

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Then its bandwidth

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
There may be

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
About one nanometer

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
About one nanometer

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But your

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But your

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
OK

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But your

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
But your

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Atomic Transition

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Isn't it all

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Atomic Transition

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
We are

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
We are

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
We are

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
But we are

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Because

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
This is the feature of Frequency Com

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Frequency Com means

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You have today

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You have today

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Uh, wait a minute

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I'll take a pen

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
I'll take a pen

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Frequency Com features

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
You're here today

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And then you have a middle

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And then you have a middle

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But because you're running out of time

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But because you're running out of time

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
A bunch of

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
A bunch of

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Right

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The advantage of this experiment is

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
The advantage of this experiment is

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You don't have to care

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Because you use another

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Because you use another

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
You split this laser

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So it's

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Because it is

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So you share it

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Because it is

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
He's gon na grow up like this

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Because it is

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Frequency Com

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Then two Frequency Com

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Then two Frequency Com

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
For example, if I lost one

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And this one is

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Then this one is

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Then this one

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
You can risk it

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
The point is that

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Although it is a pile of

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But the point is

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But the point is

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
His

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
His relative

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Whether it's fixed

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's the

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
His

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
His

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
The point is that

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Your

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Your

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
AOM

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Shift it to the point

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Is it because

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Because it is

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Equal spacing

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That is to say, the middle of it is

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Equal spacing

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
You just let the first one

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
For example, with

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
We actually let the first one

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
With the 166th

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Will

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Resonance

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
OK

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That is

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Yes, we actually do it

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
166 is right

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But in fact, you think

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The tenth one should be fine

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But we choose the 166th

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
In fact, this one

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Will be with a very far

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Here

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So this one

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Will be with the first

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
For example, 165

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Resonance

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
But

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Because they are from the same laser

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
If this frequency

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
When the left shift

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The one below will be left shift

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It doesn't matter

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
As long as they are relative

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Just lock it

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
They

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It doesn't matter if it shifts

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That's right

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
His

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
His

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
His absolute shift

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It doesn't matter

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So why do you hear me

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I don't seem to remember

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
His absolute wavelength

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
His absolute wavelength is about the same

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
The result you came out today is

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Your central frequency today

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Is 369

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Or 369.5

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
369.5

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Anyway, what he came out of

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Is stable

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Then

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Our focus is on whether I can

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
His ALM

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
His two

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Relative is not stable

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
This is more important

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Understand

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
OK

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
OK

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
If you don't have any questions for the time being

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Thank you first

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Then I will finish this video first
