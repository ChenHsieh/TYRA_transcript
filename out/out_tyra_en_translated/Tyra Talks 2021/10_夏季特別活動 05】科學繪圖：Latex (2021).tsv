0	10000	Hello, everyone. I'm very happy to be here for the fifth session of the Project TARA summer series.
10000	16000	Today's event is a scientific drawing sharing by Professor Liu Junlin.
16000	20000	I'll quickly introduce Professor Liu's background.
20000	29000	Professor Liu is currently studying electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.
29000	34000	He is currently working as an assistant professor.
34000	42000	In 2010, he obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.
42000	46000	Later, he obtained a master's degree in telecommunications.
46000	51000	In 2018, he obtained a doctorate in Caltech.
51000	60000	His research interests include Sparse Error Signal Processing and Statistical Signal Processing.
60000	66000	Today, Professor Liu will share with us his experience in latex.
66000	70000	On behalf of the audience, I welcome Professor Liu's speech.
70000	73000	Now, I'll give Professor Liu the floor. Thank you.
75000	79000	Thank you very much for the introduction.
79000	81000	Did you hear my voice?
86000	88000	Okay, thank you.
88000	92000	Thank you for the invitation to Project TARA.
92000	102000	It's an honor for me to share my experience in latex.
103000	119000	In my presentation, I will introduce my experience in latex and some basic ideas.
119000	129000	If you have any questions or ideas during the presentation, please feel free to ask.
130000	136000	Now, let's move on to today's presentation.
136000	141000	Today is the fifth session of our summer special event.
141000	143000	We will talk about scientific drawing.
143000	146000	We will mainly use the latex tool.
146000	150000	Before we start, I would like to ask the audience,
151000	156000	Have you ever heard of the term latex?
156000	159000	Can you raise your hand or make a sound?
164000	170000	I see some of the audience in the chat have heard of it.
170000	179000	For those who have heard of it, they may think that latex is a tool for writing papers.
179000	183000	Why put it under the theme of scientific drawing?
183000	188000	This is what I want to share with you today.
188000	193000	Latex actually has some relative tools that can be used for scientific drawing.
193000	197000	I also have some relative experience.
197000	200000	Let's continue our presentation.
200000	206000	First of all, I will do a simple introduction.
206000	209000	Then I will take some time to introduce latex.
209000	216000	If some of the audience has not heard of it or is not familiar with some of the details,
216000	221000	I will take some time to introduce what latex is to the audience.
221000	230000	The third part is that I will specifically mention a term called PGFTIKZ.
230000	233000	It can be a good combination with latex.
233000	236000	I will also mention some related examples.
236000	242000	Finally, I will explain some related resources to you.
242000	247000	If you are interested, you can use it as a reference.
247000	250000	Today's topic is scientific drawing.
250000	256000	I believe that most of the audience is academic background.
256000	259000	So in the academic background,
259000	263000	you often need to do an academic expression.
263000	265000	What is academic expression?
265000	268000	You may need to write a paper.
268000	271000	Or you need to write a verbal report.
271000	274000	Today's occasion is more like a verbal report.
274000	279000	In some occasions, you will need to make a poster report.
279000	286000	These are some media that are academic in expressing some concepts or more complex ideas.
286000	292000	It may be in the form of an article, a video, or a poster.
292000	294000	In these forms,
294000	300000	this chart is actually a very efficient way of communication.
300000	301000	You can imagine that
301000	306000	when you have a more complex concept that needs to be explained,
306000	309000	if you use a lot of very long sentences to explain
309000	312000	and draw a simple chart,
312000	315000	everyone can see it clearly.
315000	320000	Usually, most readers prefer to use charts
320000	324000	to make a conceptual expression.
324000	330000	So if you want to add some charts to your post,
330000	333000	the next question is
333000	337000	which interface to use to generate this chart?
337000	340000	I believe I mentioned two weeks ago that
340000	345000	you can use Illustrator to draw some pretty charts.
345000	347000	The theme of this week is
347000	352000	I want to use the Latex language interface.
352000	356000	It actually has some corresponding kits and tools
356000	360000	to create some nice charts.
361000	366000	Let me quickly use a sentence to explain what Latex is.
366000	369000	It's actually a layout system.
369000	372000	What this layout system does is
372000	377000	a lot of text files
377000	379000	after a series of compilation processes
379000	384000	are laid out into the file files you see.
384000	386000	So in fact, like the video I reported today,
386000	388000	I also did it with Latex.
388000	390000	In fact, there are a lot of
390000	393000	text compilations behind it.
393000	396000	These text compilations will tell us
396000	398000	what words are in this page,
398000	400000	what color are these words,
400000	404000	what are the order of these items,
404000	405000	and so on.
405000	408000	It will compile such a file.
408000	410000	Latex is a layout software.
410000	414000	It can compile a file based on such compilations
414000	419000	to look like the one you see in the video.
419000	423000	Let's quickly talk about PGF and TIKZ.
423000	425000	PGF is actually called
425000	428000	Portable Graphics Format.
428000	430000	In fact, what everyone is familiar with
430000	433000	is the language of TIKZ.
433000	436000	It's actually a Latex kit.
436000	442000	This kit is for drawing some charts,
442000	444000	especially when you use a compilation method
444000	445000	to describe a chart.
445000	449000	There are some particularly useful methods.
449000	450000	In the remaining time,
450000	452000	I will also mention one called PGF Plots.
452000	455000	It is also a Latex kit.
455000	460000	It can draw some common charts.
460000	462000	After using it myself,
462000	466000	I feel like I want to share it with you.
466000	469000	So today I will focus on
469000	472000	introducing these tools
472000	477000	and some of my personal experience.
477000	479000	This is a general idea
479000	483000	that we will go through today.
483000	486000	Next, I will show you a chart.
486000	488000	Let me tell you about this chart first.
488000	491000	This chart is a chart I took
491000	494000	from my class video.
494000	500000	I want to use this chart to give you an example.
500000	507000	First of all, when you look at this chart,
507000	510000	you see a lot of words,
510000	514000	a lot of shapes, a lot of colors.
514000	516000	Here is an example of this chart.
516000	519000	In fact, to describe this chart,
519000	523000	it can be divided into several steps.
523000	529000	One step is the words marked above.
529000	532000	For example, you see a lot of words up here.
532000	535000	Then there are some relative numerals.
535000	538000	There are also some relative words and numerals below.
538000	543000	So if you want to express a concept clearly,
543000	547000	there may be some relative numbers of words above.
547000	549000	In this chart,
549000	552000	you can also see some relative shapes.
555000	560000	For example, you can see a lot of squares here.
560000	564000	Then there are a lot of regular squares lined up.
564000	568000	Of course, the focus of today's speech
568000	570000	is not to introduce these details.
570000	574000	I mainly use this chart to give you an example.
574000	576000	To produce this chart,
576000	581000	you need to have some descriptions of the shapes.
581000	584000	Then you may need to do something like
584000	589000	drawing a line to produce this chart.
589000	592000	So you can see that there are
592000	594000	all kinds of lines between different squares.
594000	597000	There are green lines, there are orange lines,
597000	602000	and there may be some relatively small words marked above.
603000	605000	So usually on this kind of expression,
605000	608000	there may be some colors
608000	615000	or some relative text styles.
615000	619000	These may be some points that you can focus on
619000	623000	when designing the chart.
623000	627000	You may see this chart and think
627000	631000	that it seems to contain a lot of details.
631000	632000	Let me explain to you first.
632000	636000	This is actually one of the pages of the last video.
636000	640000	The complete version actually has a relative animation.
640000	642000	That is to say, different colors,
642000	646000	different labels will gradually appear.
646000	653000	But here is just to give you a demonstration and reference.
653000	658000	If you have any questions during the listening process,
658000	661000	you are very welcome to make a question.
661000	665000	Then we can have a discussion at the moment.
665000	667000	If you don't have any questions,
667000	669000	let me introduce the tools now.
669000	672000	My takeaway today is that
672000	675000	I hope you will have some ideas
675000	677000	about how to produce this kind of chart
677000	679000	after listening to it.
679000	681000	Of course, how to produce it in detail
681000	684000	will be related to the instructions for this chart.
684000	688000	But I hope to inspire you to say
688000	691000	that if you want to produce this kind of chart,
691000	694000	how to do it with Latex?
694000	698000	First, let me introduce this Latex.
698000	701000	Latex, as I just mentioned,
701000	703000	is a layout software.
703000	708000	In fact, it is not a single software.
708000	713000	It has a relatively advanced layout system.
713000	716000	I listed a few here.
716000	719000	For example, if you have more research
719000	722000	on the details of this kind of Latex,
722000	725000	it is actually divided into a Plantex.
725000	728000	It is the most primitive version.
728000	732000	Later, someone based on this Plantex
732000	734000	to make some improvements,
734000	739000	such as improving Latex or PDF Latex
739000	742000	or some extension versions
742000	745000	that can be compiled into Chinese.
745000	748000	But these are all relative technical details.
748000	752000	It actually has a relative development history.
752000	756000	I think today's topic is more scientific.
756000	758000	So I probably won't do
758000	761000	a detailed analysis of these items.
761000	764000	What you hear is to get a concept first.
764000	766000	It's basically a...
766000	769000	If you have some writing experience,
769000	771000	you can think of it as
771000	773000	something like a compiler.
773000	777000	It stores some text information
777000	780000	and then does some interpretation and analysis
780000	782000	according to these text contents,
782000	785000	and then produces a relative file.
785000	787000	When you look at the paper,
787000	789000	in fact, a more common file format
789000	792000	should be a PDF format.
792000	796000	So this Latex,
796000	801000	it's a relatively common design,
801000	805000	that is, the step of producing a file is
805000	808000	that the user actually compiles a text file.
808000	812000	The alias of this text file is .tex.
812000	816000	And then after some proper compilation,
816000	818000	it can produce a PDF file.
818000	821000	This PDF is a bit like the PDF files
821000	824000	you see when you read the paper.
824000	829000	So this is a basic process of Latex.
829000	833000	In fact, if you are not familiar with
833000	837000	this process,
837000	842000	if you have used Word
842000	847000	to write documents,
847000	850000	this Word file basically means
850000	852000	that you have a full window screen.
852000	854000	In this window screen,
854000	857000	suppose you have a full window screen,
857000	859000	you can do something under this screen,
859000	861000	such as inputting text and inserting a picture,
861000	864000	or doing some editing.
864000	866000	This kind of compiler is more like
866000	871000	you can see the file at the moment of editing.
871000	874000	What does it look like?
874000	877000	This Latex is another kind.
877000	879000	It's a little bit more indirect.
879000	881000	When you are operating,
881000	884000	it's actually editing a text file.
884000	887000	The text file is just describing
887000	891000	what the final document should look like
891000	894000	in a narrative language.
894000	896000	So when you are editing a text file,
896000	898000	you have to use a little bit of your imagination,
898000	900000	that is, you give this command,
900000	902000	and then it might look like
903000	907000	This PDF is the last file you see.
907000	909000	So this editing aspect
909000	911000	may not be the same as
911000	914000	the Word you often use.
914000	916000	Let's continue.
916000	919000	Next, I'm going to make an example.
919000	924000	If you haven't touched Latex,
924000	926000	I'll give you a simple example.
926000	930000	Is this word too small?
930000	936000	The left side is TEX file.
936000	938000	After proper compilation,
938000	942000	a PDF file will be created.
942000	944000	If you think the picture is too small,
944000	945000	you can tell me,
945000	949000	and I can make some adjustments here.
949000	952000	Basically, a common TEX file
952000	956000	has a standard way to do it.
956000	958000	This standard way is like this.
958000	963000	That is, when you are narrating this file,
963000	965000	you have to explain
965000	968000	what kind of thing you produce.
968000	970000	Is it an article?
970000	973000	Or, for example,
973000	975000	there are some commands that can be generated,
975000	977000	such as a video.
977000	979000	It will need to define
979000	982000	what kind of thing I produce.
982000	984000	It has a command here called
984000	986000	draw a diagonal line, then document class,
986000	991000	followed by the type of file you want to produce.
991000	993000	It's very similar to writing,
993000	994000	that is,
994000	995000	in the process of editing,
995000	999000	you need to insert some packages appropriately.
999000	1001000	These packages can tell you
1001000	1003000	what commands you can use next.
1003000	1008000	What commands are defined next?
1008000	1009000	Let me mention this a little bit.
1009000	1012000	The first package is a generation.
1012000	1015000	It will be used in the 16th line.
1015000	1020000	It is a command to generate a test text.
1020000	1022000	The command in the 5th line
1022000	1024000	is a relatively
1024000	1027000	if you want to input some mathematical equations,
1027000	1028000	some commands will be defined
1028000	1031000	in this AMS Math environment.
1031000	1034000	So, after the 18th line,
1034000	1037000	there are some mathematical equations.
1037000	1039000	So, in order to use these commands,
1039000	1043000	we need to introduce some relative packages.
1043000	1046000	Another one is that there is some information,
1046000	1048000	like this one.
1048000	1051000	I just mentioned that it is an article.
1051000	1053000	So, typical articles may need
1053000	1055000	a title information,
1055000	1056000	then the author's information,
1056000	1059000	and the date and time information.
1059000	1062000	It may need to be explained
1062000	1064000	with some relevant commands.
1064000	1068000	After setting up these environments,
1068000	1070000	the 10th line below
1070000	1075000	describes the content of your file.
1075000	1077000	So, like the 13th line,
1077000	1081000	it is a title of a file.
1081000	1082000	So, after entering this command,
1082000	1087000	the three parts on the right PDF will be generated,
1087000	1093000	that is, the title, the author's name and time.
1093000	1094000	The part of the 16th line
1094000	1096000	will generate some test text.
1096000	1099000	So, this is the part of the 16th line test text
1099000	1102000	in this place.
1102000	1104000	After the 19th line,
1104000	1106000	some mathematical formulas are generated.
1106000	1108000	These mathematical formulas are
1108000	1111000	under this text.
1111000	1114000	So, in practice,
1114000	1116000	the advantage is that
1116000	1117000	you can focus on
1117000	1120000	what you want to write.
1120000	1121000	For example, you focus on
1121000	1124000	the content you want to write,
1124000	1126000	and then the relative arrangement,
1126000	1127000	or the font,
1127000	1129000	or these words,
1129000	1130000	the mathematical formula,
1130000	1132000	the relative position.
1132000	1133000	This arrangement system
1133000	1135000	has a set of methods
1135000	1138000	to arrange these relative positions.
1138000	1140000	So, when you write this text,
1140000	1141000	you just need to focus on
1141000	1145000	the content of the text.
1145000	1149000	So, this is an example
1149000	1154000	to show you this LaTeX.
1154000	1155000	Let me explain to you
1155000	1159000	some of the corresponding tools of LaTeX.
1159000	1160000	I believe that
1160000	1163000	LaTeX has a lot of choices.
1163000	1165000	I mainly divide it into three categories.
1165000	1168000	One is called the editor.
1168000	1176000	It is mainly used to edit this text file.
1176000	1179000	The other is the layout system.
1179000	1181000	Then, the PDF file you produce
1181000	1184000	will also need some software
1184000	1187000	to look at the content of this PDF file.
1187000	1189000	So, if you want to set up
1189000	1191000	these environments on your computer,
1191000	1193000	you may need some relative...
1193000	1195000	For example, set up an editor,
1195000	1196000	a layout system,
1196000	1200000	and then choose a PDF viewer.
1200000	1203000	There are actually quite a few editors on the market.
1203000	1204000	There are some editors
1204000	1206000	specifically designed for LaTeX,
1206000	1208000	such as these below,
1208000	1210000	or some more common editors
1210000	1213000	that can only edit pure text,
1213000	1216000	such as these.
1216000	1217000	Because of time constraints,
1217000	1220000	I won't mention all of them.
1220000	1223000	After you have edited these text files,
1223000	1224000	I just mentioned that
1224000	1228000	you still need some editing systems.
1228000	1231000	These three are more common on the market.
1231000	1234000	These three can actually be downloaded for free
1234000	1236000	and installed on your computer.
1236000	1238000	They have some relative
1238000	1242000	system environment settings.
1242000	1243000	Because of time constraints,
1243000	1246000	I won't mention these environment settings.
1246000	1248000	After you have successfully edited,
1248000	1250000	there will be some relative
1250000	1254000	PDF file viewers.
1254000	1260000	Let me show you an example.
1261000	1264000	If I choose from here,
1264000	1269000	let's say I choose Visual Studio Code.
1269000	1271000	If you are writing code,
1271000	1274000	you may have heard of this editor.
1274000	1276000	Then use TextLive.
1276000	1280000	This computer has already installed TextLive.
1280000	1284000	Then there may be a PDF viewer at the end.
1284000	1287000	So I'll open a demo here.
1287000	1288000	Just this file.
1288000	1293000	This file is the same.
1293000	1294000	This is actually the same as a writer.
1294000	1298000	There will be some relative editing functions behind it.
1298000	1299000	Then this one just happens to be able to
1299000	1304000	go straight to this relative PDF function.
1304000	1305000	So if you want to edit,
1305000	1309000	let's say you want to add more things here.
1309000	1312000	Just add it directly.
1312000	1313000	If you edit,
1313000	1314000	it will be right here.
1314000	1315000	After editing,
1315000	1318000	the PDF file will be updated.
1318000	1321000	If you haven't used LaTeX,
1321000	1323000	it's actually a...
1323000	1328000	I feel like it's pretty close to writing.
1328000	1333000	It's just that the final result is a PDF file.
1333000	1337000	The above is mainly a basic introduction to LaTeX.
1337000	1339000	You may be curious.
1339000	1342000	So there are so many file editing tools.
1342000	1344000	So why do we have to use LaTeX?
1344000	1347000	Then I'm here to quickly mention
1347000	1352000	some of the features or advantages of LaTeX.
1352000	1353000	One of the features is that
1353000	1357000	it deals with this kind of mathematical problem.
1357000	1360000	Assuming that your report or paper
1360000	1363000	requires a lot of mathematical problems.
1363000	1370000	In fact, it has some advantages in using LaTeX.
1370000	1371000	For example,
1371000	1375000	like you want to enter the lower right corner of this
1375000	1378000	these mathematical formulas.
1378000	1379000	What about these mathematical formulas?
1379000	1381000	You can see that it's actually...
1381000	1382000	I'll give you an example here.
1382000	1387000	It may be related to some symbols of some triangular functions.
1387000	1391000	If you want to enter this content,
1391000	1392000	under LaTeX,
1392000	1396000	it actually opens a relative mathematical environment.
1396000	1398000	Then like these functions,
1398000	1401000	these sine, zeta,
1401000	1404000	or something like the denominator.
1404000	1408000	It will have some corresponding mathematical symbols.
1408000	1411000	For example, there are some sine, zeta,
1411000	1414000	or if you want to enter the denominator.
1414000	1418000	The denominator has some relative environments that can be entered.
1418000	1421000	Here's a strange symbol.
1421000	1424000	It actually has some relative symbols
1424000	1426000	that can be entered.
1427000	1432000	If your file has a lot of mathematical problems,
1432000	1435000	for example, there are very long mathematical inferences,
1435000	1437000	formula proofs, and so on.
1437000	1439000	Editing in text format
1439000	1441000	is actually easier to maintain.
1441000	1443000	Because when you look at the text,
1443000	1445000	you can just look at this symbol
1445000	1448000	and know what this symbol is.
1448000	1451000	And save these symbols
1451000	1456000	and translate them into our beautiful mathematical form.
1456000	1460000	Another thing I would like to mention by the way is
1460000	1462000	that LaTeX also has a feature
1462000	1464000	that is when you have a lot of things
1464000	1467000	that need to be interacted with and used.
1467000	1468000	For example,
1468000	1474000	in some related papers that may need a lot of mathematical terms,
1474000	1478000	sometimes it may use numbers to represent some equations.
1478000	1481000	Put it in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4.
1481000	1483000	Under the progress of the article,
1483000	1485000	we may need to say
1485000	1489000	which mathematical formula we use to push something.
1489000	1491000	So in the article,
1491000	1497000	we need to repeatedly mention some mathematical numbers.
1497000	1500000	LaTeX actually has some pretty good features.
1500000	1506000	You can use the interaction query command.
1507000	1511000	You can set up a label.
1511000	1512000	In the article,
1512000	1514000	when you want to quote this label,
1514000	1518000	you can use it as a variable.
1518000	1520000	Okay, let me tell you quickly
1520000	1523000	that this is a feature of LaTeX.
1523000	1525000	It has a very powerful function
1525000	1528000	in dealing with mathematical numbers.
1528000	1532000	Okay, another one is my personal experience.
1532000	1536000	It is a feature of LaTeX.
1536000	1538000	Its feature is that
1538000	1541000	when you are dealing with a very long file,
1541000	1544000	it has a special advantage.
1544000	1546000	What is a very long file?
1546000	1547000	For example,
1547000	1552000	if you want to write a master's thesis or a doctor's thesis,
1552000	1553000	at this time,
1553000	1556000	the number of pages may reach a lot of pages.
1556000	1558000	Or for example,
1558000	1560000	if you want to...
1560000	1562000	For example,
1562000	1564000	some textbooks you see on the market.
1564000	1567000	Textbooks may have hundreds or thousands of pages.
1567000	1569000	At this time,
1569000	1571000	you can try to think about
1571000	1575000	how to maintain these hundreds or thousands of pages.
1575000	1579000	In fact, LaTeX has a feature that I personally quite like.
1579000	1580000	That is,
1580000	1582000	it can split the content of the file
1582000	1585000	into different files to write.
1585000	1587000	So here's an example.
1587000	1592000	Suppose you have a file named man.tex now.
1592000	1596000	This can be seen as a main file.
1596000	1599000	This main file will describe that
1599000	1603000	there are two parts in this article.
1603000	1605000	One is introduction,
1605000	1607000	and the other is results.
1607000	1611000	That's the end of the description.
1611000	1612000	By the way,
1612000	1614000	this input file is...
1614000	1617000	The input command can be seen as
1617000	1620000	the content of this file is arranged.
1620000	1624000	You can do an understanding like this first.
1624000	1626000	So when LaTeX meets here,
1626000	1629000	it will grab the corresponding file.
1629000	1630000	So at this time,
1630000	1633000	when you write the introduction,
1633000	1638000	you just have to focus on the narrative of the introduction.
1638000	1639000	So this file is
1639000	1641000	specifically talking about the content of the introduction.
1641000	1646000	You can see that it has some test text.
1646000	1651000	Then there is a line of test text here.
1651000	1653000	This introduction,
1653000	1655000	I actually have a command here,
1655000	1657000	which is section.
1657000	1660000	It is actually one of the sections of this article.
1660000	1665000	Then the section is followed by the title of this section.
1665000	1668000	So if you want to focus on writing the introduction,
1668000	1670000	just open this file and focus on writing it.
1670000	1672000	If you want to write another section,
1672000	1673000	such as results,
1673000	1675000	just focus on opening this file
1675000	1679000	and focus on editing here.
1679000	1681000	So writing these files separately
1681000	1687000	is actually easier for you to maintain longer files.
1687000	1690000	There is another one that I personally think
1690000	1697000	LaTeX is a powerful function.
1697000	1701000	That is, if you are good at using the input command,
1701000	1702000	you can think of it as
1702000	1704000	the input is to grab a file from the outside
1704000	1706000	and paste it over.
1706000	1709000	So in fact, if you have some experimental data,
1709000	1713000	let's assume that these data are stored in text.
1713000	1717000	Suppose you use the program to calculate a number.
1717000	1719000	Suppose the number is 1, 2, 3.
1719000	1723000	Then you can store this number in a text file.
1723000	1725000	When you are editing the file,
1725000	1727000	you can insert the number content of this text file
1727000	1731000	in the right place.
1731000	1732000	You may ask,
1732000	1737000	why don't I just type 1, 2, 3 here?
1737000	1740000	The resulting file result is the same.
1740000	1744000	But from the perspective of maintenance,
1744000	1748000	I personally prefer to separate the file content
1748000	1750000	from the experimental data
1750000	1753000	to make a separate file.
1753000	1756000	Suppose you run different experiments later
1756000	1758000	and the data needs to be updated.
1758000	1761000	You just need to update this file.
1761000	1764000	You don't need to jump back to the result section
1764000	1766000	to change this number.
1766000	1769000	Especially if this number is used a lot.
1769000	1772000	This has appeared in many articles.
1772000	1774000	If you change one of the two,
1774000	1775000	and you forget to change one,
1775000	1778000	you may be challenged by the reviewer at this time.
1778000	1781000	So what do you show?
1782000	1784000	If you want to maintain a larger file
1784000	1788000	from a longer perspective,
1788000	1796000	these files may need to be changed and updated.
1796000	1800000	I personally think this kind of separate file is quite recommended.
1800000	1804000	I mentioned two features of LaTeX here.
1804000	1806000	Then I will talk about a Graphics
1806000	1808000	which is included in today's topic.
1808000	1813000	Use LaTeX to add some elements of scientific drawing.
1813000	1819000	If you search for LaTeX on the Internet,
1819000	1822000	most of the files will tell you
1822000	1826000	that there is an instruction called Include Graphics.
1826000	1829000	This instruction tells us that
1829000	1833000	this instruction needs a package called GraphicsX
1833000	1836000	to be used.
1836000	1838000	Simply put,
1838000	1841000	it will extract the file from your computer.
1841000	1844000	For example, there is a JPEG file at this time.
1844000	1847000	This JPEG file will be extracted
1847000	1854000	and placed in the proper place in your PDF file.
1854000	1856000	So I have an example here.
1856000	1858000	So he grabbed two pictures.
1858000	1863000	One is JPEG and the other is PNG.
1863000	1867000	He grabbed these two pictures to make a layout.
1867000	1871000	In fact, the left one is JPEG,
1871000	1876000	and the right one is PNG.
1876000	1883000	So now you have two pictures.
1883000	1884000	Because of time constraints,
1884000	1887000	I may not be able to explain each instruction.
1887000	1890000	If you have any questions later,
1890000	1894000	you are welcome to ask.
1894000	1896000	So this is basically an instruction
1896000	1900000	to insert two pictures.
1900000	1902000	When you draw a picture,
1902000	1904000	you need to pay attention to
1904000	1909000	that the picture is divided into Raster Scan.
1909000	1911000	You take a picture.
1911000	1914000	Suppose you have a picture on your hand.
1914000	1916000	Raster Graphics is a bit like
1916000	1920000	it takes a lot of different pixels in this picture
1920000	1926000	and records the color of each pixel.
1926000	1928000	So, for example, JPEG or PNG,
1928000	1931000	it basically stores the data behind
1931000	1935000	what the information of each pixel is.
1935000	1937000	Of course, it does some image processing
1937000	1939000	and some other processing.
1939000	1941000	But its basic spirit is
1941000	1947000	to store the contents of different colors.
1947000	1949000	But this kind of storage method
1949000	1951000	will have a disadvantage.
1951000	1952000	That is,
1952000	1959000	suppose you put this picture very large.
1959000	1962000	I may not be able to see it clearly here.
1962000	1966000	If you have JPEG or PNG on your hand,
1966000	1969000	you can try to put these pictures.
1969000	1970000	If you can't,
1970000	1971000	you can, for example,
1971000	1973000	zoom in on a place.
1973000	1975000	Keep zooming in, zooming in, zooming in.
1975000	1976000	At the end of the zoom,
1976000	1980000	you will see some blurry images on the edge.
1980000	1983000	The text may also become more blurry
1983000	1985000	and may not be able to be read.
1985000	1989000	In terms of academic documents,
1989000	1991000	this is actually a bad thing.
1991000	1992000	Because it may affect
1992000	1994000	our understanding of a concept
1994000	1997000	or judgment.
1997000	1999000	In fact, in academic documents,
1999000	2000000	it is more preferable to use
2000000	2002000	so-called vector graphics.
2002000	2004000	That is, when you are storing a picture,
2004000	2007000	you should actually use the so-called pixel picture.
2007000	2012000	When you describe these documents,
2012000	2013000	you should use,
2013000	2016000	now there is a picture.
2016000	2019000	What is its length and width?
2019000	2022000	Where is its location?
2022000	2027000	The coordinates of these points in it.
2027000	2028000	Or these lines,
2028000	2032000	are they round, square,
2032000	2035000	straight, or triangle?
2035000	2038000	Use these methods to describe a picture.
2038000	2040000	Academic documents are actually
2040000	2042000	more preferable to do this.
2042000	2043000	The commonly used vector graphics
2043000	2045000	is actually called an EPS file.
2045000	2047000	It is a commonly used vector graphics
2047000	2051000	file format.
2051000	2054000	So here you might think,
2054000	2056000	so if I use LaTeX,
2056000	2057000	I will just,
2057000	2059000	like the files generated by your program,
2059000	2062000	I will just save it as an EPS file
2062000	2065000	and insert it into it.
2065000	2068000	Theoretically, you can do this.
2068000	2072000	But have you ever thought about
2072000	2075000	some situations?
2075000	2077000	I will give you an example here.
2077000	2078000	These situations are actually
2078000	2081000	encountered in writing paper.
2081000	2083000	Suppose there are two pictures now,
2083000	2089000	the picture on the left and the picture on the right.
2089000	2091000	I will give you an example.
2091000	2093000	Suppose you want to present
2093000	2095000	a picture like this.
2095000	2096000	Then there may be a curve here,
2096000	2099000	and another curve here.
2099000	2101000	Then there may be some
2101000	2103000	corresponding legend,
2103000	2105000	that is,
2106000	2110000	what is number one and what is number two?
2110000	2112000	Number one may be one of the lines,
2112000	2115000	and number two may be one of the lines.
2115000	2117000	Have you ever encountered a situation
2117000	2121000	that when you print these pictures,
2121000	2124000	some parts of the picture,
2124000	2127000	such as some corresponding labels here,
2127000	2129000	it happens to be related to
2129000	2132000	some square numbers in your paper.
2132000	2135000	Suppose one of the curves
2135000	2138000	is generated by your source code number 1,
2138000	2140000	and the other one may be generated
2140000	2142000	by the source code number 3.
2142000	2144000	Suppose you need to encounter
2144000	2145000	a picture like this.
2145000	2147000	What about a picture like this?
2147000	2149000	If you first save it
2149000	2152000	to the EPS file in the city,
2152000	2154000	this number 1 and number 3
2154000	2158000	are actually already written in this file.
2158000	2160000	At that time, if you are editing the paper,
2160000	2163000	when this number 1 and number 3 change,
2163000	2166000	your picture will not do the corresponding update.
2166000	2168000	So this is actually a situation
2168000	2171000	that I had encountered when I was writing paper.
2171000	2175000	Then I tried to figure out
2175000	2177000	if there was a more systematic way
2177000	2179000	to deal with this problem.
2179000	2181000	This is what I'm going to talk about later,
2181000	2185000	a method of pgftikz.
2185000	2189000	It's my personal experience.
2189000	2193000	Do you have any questions here?
2193000	2195000	If you have any questions,
2195000	2204000	you can ask me by voice.
2204000	2205000	If not,
2205000	2209000	let me talk about the tool pgftikz.
2209000	2211000	First of all, when we talk about this tool,
2211000	2217000	let's go back to the picture thing.
2217000	2219000	In the field that is more related to me,
2219000	2221000	the pictures that are usually involved
2221000	2224000	are probably these two types.
2224000	2226000	One is called a system architecture picture.
2226000	2228000	It will describe
2228000	2231000	how your information is processed.
2231000	2233000	For example, you have done some add-ons,
2233000	2235000	do some processing of different systems,
2235000	2237000	and then put some relative information
2237000	2241000	to make some different connections.
2241000	2244000	The following picture is in my field of research,
2244000	2249000	which is a relatively common picture.
2249000	2253000	This is called a system architecture picture.
2253000	2255000	When you look at this picture,
2255000	2259000	it's actually quite simple.
2259000	2262000	It is mainly composed of several elements,
2262000	2267000	which are text, some lines,
2267000	2271000	and some different squares,
2271000	2274000	such as a rectangle or a circle.
2274000	2277000	It's probably just these elements.
2277000	2280000	It's not very complicated to describe.
2280000	2285000	So how to effectively produce this kind of relative picture
2285000	2288000	is actually a very interesting topic.
2288000	2291000	This is a system diagram.
2291000	2293000	The other one is the one I just mentioned,
2293000	2294000	which is a diagram.
2294000	2297000	For example, the one on my right is also a diagram.
2297000	2299000	Let's say it has two curves.
2299000	2301000	These two curves may have their own
2301000	2303000	horizontal and vertical axes,
2303000	2305000	and then there will be relative information points.
2305000	2307000	I'm just drawing a diagram here.
2307000	2309000	These information points may be represented
2309000	2315000	by a circle and a rectangle.
2315000	2317000	These two pictures
2317000	2320000	can actually be used with Lattice,
2320000	2325000	which is Lattice coupled with TIKZ or PGF plots,
2325000	2327000	which is a relative command,
2327000	2332000	to produce two such pictures directly in Lattice.
2332000	2334000	So next I'm going to explain to you
2334000	2336000	that if you want to produce these pictures,
2336000	2341000	you may need some relevant content.
2341000	2345000	Okay, let me show you the program.
2345000	2347000	TIKZ is mainly like this.
2347000	2350000	You can imagine it as a language
2350000	2353000	that describes the shape of the picture.
2353000	2356000	This language, as I just mentioned,
2356000	2360000	is a picture of a quantity.
2360000	2362000	So if you recall some of the concepts
2362000	2365000	of quantity that you may have learned before,
2365000	2366000	to describe a quantity,
2366000	2369000	it may be to describe its starting point and ending point,
2369000	2371000	and then connect them together.
2371000	2374000	Then I know how to describe different shapes.
2374000	2376000	This is to describe this triangle,
2376000	2379000	which is to mark the end point.
2379000	2381000	Or if it's a circle,
2381000	2384000	it may be to describe its circumference and radius.
2384000	2388000	So it's actually a combination of
2388000	2392000	describing the shape you produce.
2392000	2394000	So here's an example.
2394000	2398000	For example, if you want to draw a line,
2398000	2401000	its relative command is actually quite direct.
2401000	2408000	You just need to determine the relative coordinates.
2409000	2412000	The relative command is that you draw a straight line
2412000	2415000	and then draw it from the coordinate point 00
2415000	2418000	to the coordinate point 10.
2418000	2421000	So when you run the fourth line,
2421000	2426000	it will produce this line.
2426000	2428000	From 00 to 10,
2428000	2431000	it draws this line.
2431000	2433000	There are also some commands that say
2433000	2436000	you can decorate this line.
2436000	2439000	For example, you can draw a arrow.
2439000	2441000	Its relative command is that
2441000	2443000	you draw a shape like an arrow.
2443000	2446000	Draw a line and then a triangle.
2446000	2450000	The shape of this arrow starts from 00.
2450000	2452000	You can think of it as drawing an arrow
2452000	2455000	from 00 to 01.
2455000	2458000	So it's the arrow above.
2458000	2464000	So it's actually a pretty intuitive description language
2464000	2467000	to describe some geometric shapes.
2467000	2470000	For example, if you want to draw a triangle,
2470000	2475000	it's actually the relative coordinate point.
2475000	2477000	It's actually this point.
2477000	2480000	This point is our 11 coordinate point.
2480000	2483000	Then this point is 22.
2483000	2488000	Then this is 2.
2488000	2491000	So you draw these lines
2491000	2493000	and connect them.
2493000	2495000	There are some additional commands.
2495000	2498000	For example, you can adjust the thickness of the line,
2498000	2500000	adjust the format of the line,
2500000	2502000	or adjust the color of the line.
2502000	2505000	This is a demo for you.
2505000	2510000	Of course, it can draw something like a circle.
2510000	2514000	This means that the center of the circle is 1-1.
2514000	2516000	The center of the circle is 1-1,
2516000	2519000	and the radius is 0.5.
2519000	2521000	So it draws this.
2521000	2523000	You can also draw something relative.
2523000	2526000	For example, it draws a rectangle.
2526000	2528000	This rectangle,
2528000	2530000	its command is
2530000	2535000	to draw from one corner of this rectangle
2535000	2538000	to another corner.
2538000	2543000	So the upper left corner is 3-1,
2543000	2547000	and the lower right corner is 4-2.
2547000	2549000	So it's actually
2549000	2551000	as long as you determine the coordinate system,
2551000	2553000	and then determine some coordinate numbers,
2553000	2557000	it actually has some pretty intuitive language
2557000	2560000	to draw these pictures.
2560000	2564000	So this is basically the function of TIKZ drawing.
2564000	2566000	You can actually go back to
2566000	2569000	suppose you need to draw a picture.
2569000	2571000	If it's something like
2571000	2574000	some of the architecture pictures mentioned earlier,
2574000	2578000	it's actually nothing more than some lines, shapes,
2578000	2582000	and some combinations of text blocks.
2582000	2586000	So if you want to draw a text block,
2586000	2590000	it can use a command called node.
2590000	2592000	This node command,
2592000	2594000	you can think of it as
2594000	2596000	insert a text block,
2596000	2599000	and then insert it in which position.
2599000	2602000	For example, the command 22 is
2602000	2604000	inserted in 00.
2604000	2607000	Insert a text block in 00.
2607000	2613000	Then its text content is 00.
2613000	2615000	One thing that's special is that
2615000	2616000	in this place,
2616000	2619000	it's actually
2619000	2621000	the place where I marked in green,
2621000	2625000	it's actually in harmony with the lattice.
2625000	2627000	Simply put,
2627000	2631000	the grammar you can use in the lattice,
2631000	2633000	including the mathematical formula you use,
2633000	2636000	or the formula you want to quote,
2636000	2638000	or the reference number you want to quote,
2638000	2640000	can all be written directly here.
2640000	2642000	Then when the lattice is compiled,
2642000	2647000	it will automatically update this part.
2647000	2648000	Because of the time factor,
2648000	2650000	I may not go into detail about these commands.
2650000	2655000	Basically, you can create some text blocks.
2655000	2659000	Then I will tell you another concept.
2659000	2663000	What I personally like about TIK is that
2663000	2670000	it can make a very precise description of your chart.
2670000	2671000	What's the reason?
2671000	2673000	The reason is that it uses some
2673000	2675000	coordinate numbers behind it
2675000	2679000	to describe the shape of the chart.
2679000	2680000	So for example,
2680000	2683000	let's say I draw this picture on the right.
2683000	2685000	This picture on the right,
2685000	2689000	I have listed the corresponding commands.
2689000	2693000	Basically, it is inserted into a text block.
2693000	2695000	What I want to do is to insert a text block.
2695000	2698000	Then its content is this text box.
2698000	2702000	Then some corresponding styles.
2702000	2706000	Then its location is 0, 0 in the coordinate system.
2706000	2708000	Then a more special thing is that
2708000	2711000	you can take a name for this text block.
2711000	2715000	Take a name like this with a small quotation mark.
2715000	2717000	Then when you draw something else,
2717000	2720000	you can compare this name,
2720000	2722000	the name of the text box,
2722000	2727000	to describe its different locations.
2727000	2731000	For example, it's like 6 to 8 here.
2731000	2735000	It can target the north-west of the text box,
2735000	2737000	this top left point.
2737000	2743000	Draw a circle at this point on the left of the text box.
2743000	2747000	Then the radius of this circle is 0.05.
2747000	2749000	So you get this circle.
2749000	2753000	It is very accurately pasted on the top left corner of this text box.
2753000	2756000	You can draw it like the north side
2756000	2759000	or other places like this.
2759000	2762000	So you can draw these corresponding locations.
2762000	2765000	These locations can also be called anchor points.
2765000	2769000	That is, when you connect the lines,
2769000	2773000	you can directly force the specified line to connect to this point,
2773000	2776000	or this point, this point.
2776000	2780000	So this is the one for TIKZ.
2780000	2784000	Then I will explain a little bit about
2784000	2786000	some of my personal experience
2786000	2790000	and some of the experience of drawing this system architecture.
2790000	2792000	One of my personal favorites is that
2792000	2797000	it is actually quite compatible with Lattice.
2797000	2801000	For example, you are in this place of this text,
2801000	2804000	it is actually the direct input of the corresponding Lattice command.
2804000	2806000	So when you have a square number,
2806000	2808000	or some numbers,
2808000	2812000	or some special mathematical characters,
2812000	2814000	for example,
2814000	2817000	like you need a special character in this picture,
2817000	2820000	it can be presented perfectly.
2820000	2823000	Another one is the relative size.
2823000	2827000	These sizes are actually all described in numbers,
2827000	2831000	so it can describe the relative position very accurately.
2831000	2836000	So these two text boxes are actually the same size.
2836000	2841000	That is, the size of this square and this square is the same.
2841000	2845000	And they are actually completely aligned.
2845000	2848000	If you put the picture carefully,
2848000	2851000	you can see that the left half and the right half are curved,
2851000	2854000	and they are precisely aligned.
2854000	2856000	Why is that?
2856000	2858000	In fact, when you are writing,
2858000	2861000	you have already described this thing accurately.
2861000	2863000	So the picture he made
2863000	2868000	can be very precise in size and position.
2868000	2869000	Another one is that
2869000	2873000	I think this kind of picture is easier to maintain.
2873000	2874000	Simply put,
2874000	2876000	because there are these text boxes behind it,
2876000	2878000	so if you want to maintain it,
2878000	2884000	if you want to make all the circles bigger in this text box,
2884000	2886000	I don't want to use 0.05,
2886000	2889000	I want to make all these circles bigger.
2889000	2892000	In fact, it is to make some search replacements in the text box,
2892000	2895000	and replace all these 0.05.
2895000	2899000	Another one is my personal opinion.
2899000	2901000	Because it is a text box,
2901000	2903000	so if you have some software
2903000	2905000	that allows you to control the interface,
2905000	2907000	and if you have experience in using it,
2907000	2909000	it can be used in a way like git
2909000	2912000	to maintain your file or image,
2912000	2915000	how to make changes.
2915000	2921000	So this is what I think about drawing some pictures with TIKZ.
2921000	2924000	Next, let's talk about some plots.
2924000	2925000	This plot,
2925000	2927000	you can look at it as
2927000	2932000	some of the pictures we just drew in some experiments.
2932000	2933000	Some of the pictures presented in some experiments,
2933000	2941000	and then there may be some horizontal and vertical descriptions.
2941000	2942000	To produce this picture,
2942000	2944000	you can think about
2944000	2946000	what you actually did
2946000	2948000	when you produced this picture.
2948000	2949000	In fact, it doesn't matter,
2949000	2953000	you probably did three things.
2953000	2954000	The first thing is that
2954000	2956000	you worked very hard to do some experiments,
2956000	2958000	write some cities,
2958000	2960000	produce some experimental data,
2960000	2962000	or collect some experimental data.
2962000	2965000	So this should be a stage for you to do research,
2965000	2969000	which is to produce some experimental data.
2969000	2971000	The other stage is that
2971000	2973000	according to your experimental data,
2973000	2976000	you want to produce some more beautiful pictures,
2976000	2977000	and then maybe clearer,
2977000	2980000	some pictures that are more visible,
2980000	2983000	so this may be the second stage.
2983000	2985000	The third stage is that
2985000	2987000	when you produce the picture,
2987000	2989000	you need to present it in,
2989000	2990000	for example, your paper,
2990000	2992000	or your video,
2992000	2994000	or on your poster.
2994000	2997000	So there may be these three stages.
2997000	2999000	The stage that people use more often
2999000	3001000	may be that
3001000	3004000	they tend to use the same software
3004000	3007000	for stage 1 and stage 2.
3007000	3008000	For example,
3008000	3011000	what I use more often is MATLAB.
3011000	3013000	You can do some calculations in MATLAB,
3013000	3017000	and then it has some functions that can produce pictures.
3017000	3020000	After the picture, you can save it like this,
3020000	3022000	and then save it,
3022000	3024000	and then paste it on,
3024000	3026000	for example, your paper or slides.
3026000	3028000	This is a method.
3028000	3030000	If you have some other languages,
3030000	3032000	such as Python or R,
3032000	3034000	or GNU Plot,
3034000	3038000	it actually has a lot of different choices.
3038000	3042000	This is a method.
3042000	3045000	It's a more common method.
3045000	3049000	Here, I'd like to ask you a few situations.
3049000	3051000	These situations are actually
3051000	3054000	what you encounter when you do research.
3054000	3059000	If you encounter the following three situations,
3059000	3063000	the above methods may become a little bit
3063000	3065000	more cumbersome.
3065000	3067000	The first situation is that
3067000	3072000	if you have produced your picture,
3072000	3074000	and you have shown it to other people,
3074000	3077000	to your partner or advisor,
3077000	3079000	he thinks this picture
3079000	3082000	may need to add one more curve,
3082000	3084000	or compare it in one more way,
3084000	3086000	or add some more data points.
3086000	3089000	If you use a method like MATLAB,
3089000	3091000	you may have to go back to the original city,
3091000	3093000	and run the city again.
3093000	3095000	But think about it,
3095000	3097000	this seems to be a little bit,
3097000	3099000	some places are repeated.
3099000	3102000	In fact, in this picture,
3102000	3104000	there are some curves and some data
3104000	3106000	that you have dealt with before.
3106000	3111000	So you don't need to deal with it again.
3111000	3113000	What you need to do
3113000	3115000	is to deal with
3115000	3117000	what you haven't done yet.
3117000	3120000	So, is there anything
3120000	3123000	that can separate this thing?
3123000	3126000	It's like the first thing,
3126000	3128000	produce data and draw a picture.
3128000	3131000	Can these two things be handled separately?
3131000	3133000	When you have a new experiment,
3133000	3135000	you should focus on
3135000	3137000	producing new data.
3137000	3139000	Drawing a picture,
3139000	3141000	you should have a common interface
3141000	3145000	to update the picture.
3145000	3147000	Another situation is that
3147000	3149000	maybe when you are writing a paper,
3149000	3152000	suppose you change the mathematical symbol.
3152000	3154000	In the process of changing the paper,
3154000	3156000	maybe there are some mathematical symbols
3157000	3159000	Then you may change it to B.
3159000	3161000	It becomes that in this article,
3161000	3163000	everything with the symbol A
3163000	3165000	has to be changed to the symbol B.
3165000	3167000	If unfortunately,
3167000	3169000	this symbol B appears in one of the small places
3169000	3171000	in your picture,
3171000	3174000	then you have to go back and open the method
3174000	3178000	and manually change the place of A to B.
3178000	3179000	When there are a lot of things,
3179000	3182000	this thing is actually a little bit,
3182000	3185000	it's a little bit cumbersome.
3185000	3186000	Then there is another one,
3186000	3189000	which is the relative mathematical symbol.
3189000	3191000	If you have some drawing experience,
3191000	3193000	the picture produced by MATLAB,
3193000	3197000	the text below it is actually a certain symbol.
3197000	3200000	But if you use LaTeX to write a paper,
3200000	3202000	the shape of the symbol required by the paper
3202000	3205000	is actually sometimes another one.
3205000	3208000	It may not be the same as the MATLAB symbol.
3208000	3209000	So is there a way to say
3209000	3212000	that all the symbols are unified?
3212000	3213000	In addition,
3213000	3216000	if there is a mathematical shape here,
3216000	3219000	suppose some more special mathematical symbols,
3219000	3222000	can they appear in this picture
3222000	3225000	with the same shape?
3225000	3228000	In fact, I encountered some relative situations
3228000	3232000	in the drawing before.
3232000	3234000	After a little research,
3234000	3238000	I think I personally
3238000	3241000	use this method of PGF plot.
3241000	3244000	It is actually a drawing tool,
3244000	3247000	and it is based on TIKZ as a drawing function.
3247000	3251000	It is compatible with LaTeX.
3251000	3253000	It is a new drawing tool,
3253000	3255000	but its spirit of drawing
3255000	3261000	is actually similar to most drawing software.
3261000	3264000	You will need to produce relative labels,
3264000	3268000	legend, or some different line format.
3268000	3272000	This part of the spirit is close.
3272000	3273000	Because of time constraints,
3273000	3275000	I may quickly mention that
3275000	3276000	although this is a new tool,
3276000	3280000	but there are some ready-made conversion tools.
3280000	3282000	Suppose the picture produced by MATLAB
3282000	3284000	can have some converters
3284000	3287000	that can be converted to TIKZ language.
3287000	3290000	This is what I found when I was making the video,
3290000	3294000	that is, some pictures produced by Python
3294000	3296000	also have some related packages
3296000	3301000	that can be converted to the language of TIKZ.
3301000	3304000	Another experience I would like to mention is
3304000	3309000	that suppose you need to update your data.
3309000	3310000	As mentioned earlier,
3310000	3312000	suppose you have three experimental pictures,
3312000	3316000	and you may be asked to add another curve.
3316000	3319000	At this time,
3319000	3322000	you don't need to create a new picture.
3322000	3324000	My own approach is
3324000	3327000	that you should maintain a text file.
3327000	3330000	This text file describes the data
3330000	3334000	of the relative data points in the green one.
3334000	3337000	There may be a blue text file
3337000	3340000	that describes the numbers on the blue lines,
3340000	3343000	the numbers on these pictures.
3343000	3345000	At that time,
3345000	3348000	the pgfplot can directly use the input file method
3348000	3351000	to update these pictures at the same time.
3351000	3353000	I want to use the time later
3353000	3356000	to quickly tell you what its philosophy is.
3356000	3358000	If you are interested in these instructions,
3358000	3360000	we can discuss it later.
3360000	3364000	This is a pgfplot spirit.
3364000	3366000	You can notice that it is actually
3366000	3369000	compatible with the latest.
3369000	3374000	It is actually wrapped in the environment of TIKZ.
3374000	3376000	What it does is
3376000	3381000	there is an environment called begin and end access.
3381000	3382000	In this environment,
3382000	3385000	you will need to have a range to explain
3385000	3387000	some of the coordinates,
3387000	3391000	such as its width, its x-level,
3391000	3394000	what is the value, and then what is the y-level value.
3394000	3396000	Notice that this place
3396000	3398000	you can put the latest definition.
3398000	3402000	So you can make sure that its font is the same.
3402000	3405000	So if you look closely at this picture,
3405000	3407000	the font of this place
3407000	3410000	is the same as the font of my first video.
3411000	3413000	So if you update it like this,
3413000	3415000	it will automatically process these two
3415000	3417000	with the same font.
3417000	3420000	The addplot is a bit like
3420000	3423000	you have a curve, so it will produce
3423000	3425000	a curve of data1 here
3425000	3427000	and a curve of data2.
3427000	3429000	Here it is another
3429000	3431000	from an external text file.
3431000	3433000	This is an external text file.
3433000	3435000	It will define all the numbers
3435000	3437000	of these data points.
3438000	3440000	Grab these data
3440000	3444000	and paste it into this picture.
3444000	3447000	I want to tell you quickly.
3447000	3449000	Finally, let me tell you
3449000	3452000	what I think of Latex.
3452000	3455000	If you are new to Latex,
3455000	3458000	DIKZ, PJ Plot,
3458000	3460000	maybe you have never touched it
3460000	3463000	or maybe you don't have much experience,
3463000	3466000	I personally recommend Overleaf.
3466000	3468000	Overleaf is a platform
3468000	3471000	where you can write Latex online.
3471000	3474000	Basically,
3474000	3478000	some of the layout settings
3478000	3480000	have been set for you.
3480000	3485000	So it will be easier to write.
3485000	3487000	I will list some
3487000	3489000	relative reference resources later.
3489000	3490000	If you use Overleaf,
3490000	3492000	it actually has some
3492000	3494000	related instructions
3494000	3496000	and some documents
3496000	3498000	that you can learn Latex
3498000	3500000	in 30 minutes.
3500000	3502000	I also found some
3502000	3504000	if you want to do
3504000	3505000	a more detailed reference,
3505000	3507000	there are some like Wikibook
3507000	3509000	for reference.
3509000	3511000	If you are interested
3511000	3512000	in this kind of drawing,
3512000	3514000	there is a PGF manual.
3514000	3516000	You can click on it.
3516000	3519000	It has a pretty detailed
3519000	3522000	document
3522000	3523000	like this.
3523000	3526000	Let me show you.
3526000	3528000	It has a document
3528000	3531000	for DIKZ, PJ Plot
3531000	3534000	with more than 1,000 pages.
3534000	3535000	In fact, many of my instructions
3535000	3536000	are found from it.
3536000	3538000	The concept is also
3538000	3541000	taken from it.
3541000	3542000	Some websites,
3542000	3544000	like this website,
3544000	3546000	I think it's pretty good.
3546000	3548000	It has some examples of
3548000	3549000	drawing with PJ Plot.
3549000	3551000	So if you go in and have a look,
3551000	3553000	there are some pretty
3553000	3554000	maps.
3554000	3556000	It also lists the relevant instructions.
3556000	3558000	You can have a look.
3558000	3560000	Another one is that
3560000	3563000	there are also some online discussions on the Internet.
3563000	3565000	If you have any questions about this kind of text,
3565000	3567000	you can post it on it.
3567000	3568000	What's next?
3568000	3569000	I mainly list some
3569000	3572000	editors I mentioned earlier.
3572000	3574000	There are some relative websites
3574000	3576000	with relative editors.
3576000	3578000	Basically,
3578000	3579000	these editors should all be
3579000	3581000	downloaded from the website
3581000	3583000	and installed.
3583000	3584000	It's also like
3584000	3585000	if you want to set up
3585000	3587000	this editor environment
3587000	3589000	on your own computer,
3589000	3591000	there are actually several more common ones.
3591000	3595000	I also list the relevant information.
3595000	3597000	If you are interested in
3597000	3598000	this kind of map conversion, DIKZ,
3598000	3600000	I also list the relevant
3600000	3602000	websites here.
3602000	3604000	You can use it as a reference.
3604000	3606000	Okay, I think it's about time.
3607000	3609000	Finally, thank you for listening.
3609000	3611000	I hope you can
3611000	3613000	use LaTeX
3613000	3615000	in your research
3615000	3617000	and successfully express
3617000	3620000	the results you want to express.
3620000	3622000	Okay, I think
3622000	3624000	we'll stop here.
3628000	3630000	Thank you, Mr. Liu, for your wonderful sharing.
3630000	3632000	I just saw
3632000	3634000	in the chat
3634000	3636000	a few questions.
3636000	3638000	If you have any questions,
3638000	3640000	you're welcome to
3640000	3642000	open the microphone
3642000	3644000	and ask your question.
3652000	3654000	Or if your microphone is not convenient,
3654000	3656000	I can quickly go through
3656000	3658000	the comments.
3658000	3660000	There are a few comments
3660000	3662000	I saw,
3662000	3664000	for example, Yan
3664000	3666000	wants to know
3666000	3668000	how similar
3668000	3670000	LaTeX and HTML are.
3670000	3672000	Do you recommend using
3672000	3674000	text editor software?
3680000	3682000	Okay, thank you very much
3682000	3684000	for Yan's question.
3684000	3686000	I'll start with
3686000	3688000	the degree of similarity between
3688000	3690000	the two languages.
3690000	3692000	Here is a
3692000	3694000	user interface
3694000	3696000	for your reference.
3696000	3698000	In fact, if you
3698000	3700000	have a little research
3700000	3702000	on HTML,
3702000	3704000	HTML seems to
3704000	3706000	have something
3706000	3708000	at the beginning of a label
3708000	3710000	and something
3710000	3712000	at the end.
3712000	3714000	In LaTeX,
3714000	3716000	it's more like
3716000	3718000	using a line
3718000	3720000	and then a command,
3720000	3722000	and then put this thing
3722000	3724000	inside with this big quotation mark.
3724000	3726000	I feel
3726000	3728000	that its spirit is close.
3728000	3730000	For example,
3730000	3732000	if the thing you put in the back
3732000	3734000	is more complicated,
3734000	3736000	it will use some
3736000	3738000	begin-end environment
3738000	3740000	to wrap
3740000	3742000	the things here.
3742000	3744000	So
3744000	3746000	I think the spirit is
3746000	3748000	quite similar to
3748000	3750000	HTML.
3750000	3752000	It's
3752000	3754000	also close to what I mentioned earlier.
3754000	3756000	Its spirit is a bit like
3756000	3758000	writing
3758000	3760000	mathematics
3760000	3762000	or
3762000	3764000	a layout for
3764000	3766000	academic articles.
3766000	3768000	It may have more functions.
3770000	3772000	Let's see
3776000	3778000	the next one.
3778000	3780000	LaTeX.
3780000	3782000	Use
3782000	3784000	the source code
3784000	3786000	control software
3786000	3788000	to pursue
3788000	3790000	the editing problem.
3790000	3792000	Thank you.
3792000	3794000	I seem to have forgotten to answer a question.
3794000	3796000	Do you recommend using
3796000	3798000	text editor software
3798000	3800000	to understand text grammar?
3800000	3802000	I didn't seem to answer this one.
3802000	3804000	I can go back to
3804000	3806000	the previous one.
3810000	3812000	In my opinion,
3812000	3814000	as long as it's easy to use.
3816000	3818000	In fact,
3818000	3820000	these can be recognized.
3824000	3826000	The red ones
3826000	3828000	should be able to recognize text grammar.
3828000	3830000	Then
3830000	3832000	the right ones
3832000	3834000	may need to install some special
3834000	3836000	kits.
3836000	3838000	The last one is a
3838000	3840000	notebook in Windows.
3840000	3842000	So it may
3842000	3844000	not be able to have other kits.
3844000	3846000	The first few editors
3846000	3848000	actually have corresponding kits.
3848000	3850000	I can
3850000	3852000	demo it for you.
3852000	3854000	I use Visual Studio Code here.
3854000	3856000	Then it has a
3856000	3858000	package called
3858000	3860000	LaTeX Workshop.
3862000	3864000	It actually
3864000	3866000	writes a little bit like
3866000	3868000	what you see here with
3868000	3880000	relative
3880000	3882000	conforming
3882000	3884000	instructions.
3886000	3888000	Good.
3888000	3890000	I don't know if I can turn on the setting.
3890000	3892000	Well,
3892000	3894000	I usually
3894000	3896000	change it directly.
3896000	3898000	Well,
3898000	3900000	if you are interested,
3900000	3902000	you can actually study it a little bit,
3902000	3904000	that is,
3904000	3906000	I usually
3906000	3908000	change it directly.
3908000	3910000	Well,
3910000	3912000	if you are interested,
3912000	3914000	you can actually study it a little bit,
3914000	3916000	that is,
3916000	3918000	you can actually study it a little bit,
3918000	3920000	that is,
3920000	3922000	Visual Studio Code with
3922000	3924000	Latest Workshop.
3924000	3926000	In fact,
3926000	3928000	this kit will help you
3928000	3930000	set things up.
3930000	3932000	So when you type directly,
3932000	3934000	you can begin,
3934000	3936000	and then it will be generated directly.
3938000	3940000	So,
3940000	3942000	although it is a text editor,
3942000	3944000	it is suitable for
3944000	3946000	when you want to use it,
3946000	3948000	sometimes
3948000	3950000	it seems that
3950000	3952000	some environments can be selected.
3954000	3956000	Well,
3956000	3958000	I believe that
3958000	3960000	these I marked can actually
3960000	3962000	do similar functions.
3962000	3964000	If it is on the left,
3964000	3966000	it should be preset,
3966000	3968000	and there are some relatively
3968000	3970000	grammatical instructions.
3970000	3972000	Then I go back to
3972000	3974000	the third question.
3976000	3978000	Well,
3978000	3980000	if you need more people to edit a document,
3980000	3982000	that is,
3982000	3984000	directly using the source code control software to track
3984000	3986000	or there is a test dedicated maintenance platform.
3986000	3988000	Well,
3988000	3990000	if you want to be
3990000	3992000	simple and easy to use,
3992000	3994000	that is, you don't need to do any settings,
3994000	3996000	I personally recommend Overleaf.
3996000	3998000	It is that you
3998000	4000000	open an account in Overleaf,
4000000	4002000	you can open a project
4002000	4004000	under this account,
4004000	4006000	and then you can share it with others.
4006000	4008000	If other people are editing,
4008000	4010000	in fact,
4010000	4012000	I remember that there are some on the right,
4012000	4014000	you can do some discussions,
4014000	4016000	you can do some comments.
4016000	4018000	So personally, I think Overleaf
4018000	4020000	is actually a relatively
4020000	4022000	friendly interface
4022000	4024000	for beginners.
4024000	4026000	Well,
4026000	4028000	if you use the source code control software
4028000	4030000	to edit documents,
4030000	4032000	that's fine.
4032000	4034000	If you have,
4034000	4036000	I just mentioned Git,
4036000	4038000	it should be mentioned in Overleaf.
4046000	4048000	Here I mentioned Git,
4048000	4050000	that is, it is actually a version control software.
4050000	4052000	You can imagine it
4052000	4054000	as controlling
4054000	4056000	a group of text files,
4056000	4058000	which changes it made.
4058000	4060000	If you do
4060000	4062000	the right maintenance,
4062000	4064000	these changes can be
4064000	4066000	shared between multiple users.
4070000	4072000	I am using
4072000	4074000	Git,
4074000	4076000	but after I write a paragraph,
4076000	4078000	I will commit it to
4078000	4080000	Git,
4080000	4082000	that is, I am now drawing to this extent,
4082000	4084000	and then save it first.
4084000	4086000	If there are more users,
4086000	4088000	I believe that Git
4088000	4090000	can also do it.
4094000	4096000	The dedicated maintenance platform
4096000	4098000	may be Overleaf.
4098000	4100000	So it is more like
4100000	4102000	it depends on
4102000	4104000	which interface
4104000	4106000	users like to use.
4108000	4110000	I don't know if I have answered
4110000	4112000	Ian's question.
4112000	4114000	At this stage,
4114000	4116000	I would like to
4116000	4118000	stop the recording.
4118000	4120000	If you still have time
4120000	4122000	and have questions,
4122000	4124000	you are welcome to
4124000	4126000	discuss freely.
4126000	4128000	Thank you for your sharing.
