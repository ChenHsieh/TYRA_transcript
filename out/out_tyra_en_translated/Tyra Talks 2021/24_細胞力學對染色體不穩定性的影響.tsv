0	11000	Hello everyone, thank you all for participating in this speech from different cities around the world.
11000	16000	Thank you very much for the detailed introduction just now.
16000	21000	What I want to introduce today is what I want to talk about my research and what I did in the past.
21000	26000	Then there are one or two slides to bring a little bit about how I plan to do this topic in the future.
26000	33000	For the overview part, I will try to use the Chinese slides and the Chinese way to do the speech.
33000	39000	For the more detailed research part, I will try to speak in Chinese, but I will use English slides.
39000	43000	Because I'm not so confident in Chinese translation.
43000	47000	But I will try to introduce it to you in Chinese.
47000	52000	I also know that the background of the speakers and the audience is not the same.
52000	55000	So if you have any questions, you are welcome to interrupt me.
55000	58000	Then we can go back and forth once or twice.
58000	65000	If you find that there are still some problems that cannot be solved, then we can do some more in-depth discussions at the end.
65000	69000	What I want to discuss today is the impact of mechanics on the instability of dyeing.
69000	72000	Especially when looking at this problem from the perspective of cell division.
72000	78000	We know that we learn a lot of loss division from high school and high school biology.
78000	87000	Loss division usually means that when a cell produces a tissue, both sides of the cell will have the same number of dyes.
87000	92000	Let me quickly go through the process of loss division.
92000	97000	In the process of cell division, the dye will become this shape.
97000	99000	It's a bit like a sausage.
100000	110000	If you fix it in the way of dyeing and look at it with a microscope, you will find that it looks a bit like two sausages.
110000	114000	In the process, the membrane will begin to decompose.
114000	122000	In the process of decomposition, the dye will begin to form the so-called epithelium.
122000	126000	This epithelium will try to form the shape of this epithelium.
126000	134000	In the process, the dye will interact with the epithelium.
134000	138000	The dye will be brought to the center by the epithelium.
138000	140000	Let's call it neutralization.
140000	145000	There is a very important component called the connective core.
145000	152000	Connective core means that the dye will react with the epithelium at this point.
152000	158000	When the dye is well arranged in the middle, the cells will enter the so-called anaphase.
158000	161000	At this time, the dye will be divided into two sides.
161000	164000	This process is actually very difficult.
164000	170000	Many people are discussing why this process can be so perfect.
170000	173000	There are two things that I must highlight.
173000	176000	The so-called spindle assembly checkpoint.
176000	178000	This checkpoint is a checkpoint signal.
178000	185000	When the dye is not connected to the spindle, the checkpoint will be turned on.
185000	188000	When this signal is turned on, the cells will not be able to go down.
188000	190000	This is the concept of a checkerboard.
190000	196000	If the checkerboard finds that the system is a little problematic, it will try not to let this happen.
196000	199000	There is another system called error correction.
199000	203000	Let's call it the error correction mechanism.
203000	207000	This error correction mechanism is that when it finds that the dye is not arranged like this,
207000	212000	There is a set of error correction mechanisms in our cells that try to arrange it correctly.
212000	218000	In this way, when it enters the process of cell division, there will be no errors.
218000	221000	But in fact, there are many times when there are so-called errors.
221000	226000	Let's call it abnormal division.
226000	230000	In the process of abnormal division, the dye will be unstable.
231000	232000	Let me give you an example.
232000	235000	I have two sets of dyes here.
235000	237000	I color-coded them.
237000	242000	You can see that these two sets of dyes are all connected to the same side.
242000	243000	The other side is not connected.
243000	245000	So you can imagine this process.
245000	249000	If it passes through the post-division and then divides into two cells,
249000	252000	The dye of the two cells will have different numbers.
252000	254000	We call it aneuploidy in English.
254000	255000	Let me check it out.
255000	257000	It's called aneuploidy.
257000	258000	It's quite strange.
259000	260000	This is a problem.
260000	261000	There are some problems with aneuploidy.
261000	267000	For example, if the number of dyes is increasing, it may be able to express more things.
267000	269000	If there is one more or one less dye,
269000	274000	Is there no way for some proteins to increase or decrease?
274000	275000	This will cause some problems.
275000	277000	In recent years, some people have been discussing this problem.
277000	279000	This is the so-called homeostasis problem.
280000	284000	Another problem is that the dye is labeled in red.
284000	285000	In fact, this problem is more serious.
286000	289000	In this case, this aneuploidy will connect two different cells.
289000	293000	By the way, this aneuploidy is not only one-to-one.
293000	295000	Because there are hundreds of proteins on the aneuploidy.
295000	302000	It also has dozens of proteins that can interact with the aneuploid.
302000	305000	So some aneuploid proteins may be connected to the aneuploid on the other side.
305000	308000	Some will be connected to the aneuploid on the left.
309000	313000	If this aneuploid is connected to this red situation,
313000	315000	In the process of separation, you can imagine that
315000	321000	Because the aneuploid usually has a pull force to pull the two aneuploids apart.
321000	324000	If this red one is not eliminated,
324000	327000	In other words, if the error correction is not done well,
327000	333000	Then this red aneuploid can't run normally to this group.
333000	336000	Then it is incorporated into a homo.
336000	339000	So at this time we call it a lagging chromosome.
339000	340000	Because it runs slower.
341000	343000	What's special about this lagging chromosome?
343000	346000	In fact, many people have been studying this problem in the past ten years.
346000	350000	Because this lagging chromosome can't get into the main homo.
350000	354000	So the cells will automatically produce a small homo around it.
354000	355000	We call it a micronucleotide.
356000	359000	If you really look at some of its biochemical properties,
359000	360000	Or the properties of cell biology,
360000	365000	You will find that it is very different from the original homo.
365000	368000	It has a lot of holes.
369000	373000	It has a lot of holes, which means that many enzymes in many cells
373000	376000	Or these messages can run into this homo.
376000	377000	Then go to decompose this protein.
377000	381000	This is actually a very typical immune response in our cells.
381000	384000	If we encounter this problem, we can find a way to...
386000	388000	You know, our cells may have some...
388000	390000	Because usually if you look at the cell membrane,
390000	394000	If you see some double-stranded DNA in the cell tissue,
394000	397000	Then we all think that it may be a virus.
397000	399000	So some of our cells will have some reactions,
399000	401000	Will try to cut these abnormal double-stranded DNA.
401000	404000	So in theory, this cell will be cleared.
404000	406000	But if this cell survives,
406000	410000	Those cut off oxidants may be regrouped.
410000	413000	Then there will be a lot of mutations.
413000	416000	So the people in this field feel that
416000	419000	If this cell survives, there will be serious mutations.
419000	424000	Is the cancer cell going to use this method to increase its genetic diversity?
424000	427000	This is a big topic in the field at present.
428000	432000	Okay, let me talk about some of the classic problems of cell division.
432000	437000	First, how does the instability of the cancer cell affect the occurrence of cancer?
437000	439000	I said last time that
439000	443000	The instability of the cancer cell can make some cancer cells regroup.
443000	446000	It can promote the genetic diversity of tumor cells.
446000	449000	It sounds like the instability of the cancer cell is good.
449000	452000	But we found out again that it's not us.
452000	454000	The research field found that
454000	456000	If your cancer cell is too unstable,
456000	460000	It will lead to some signal of cell division.
460000	462000	The cancer cell can't increase its genetic diversity.
462000	464000	Because it's all dead.
464000	467000	So there are some ideas in this field.
467000	469000	Is there a so-called Achilles heel?
469000	471000	It's the heel of Achilles.
471000	474000	Cancer cells can use CIN to increase its genetic diversity.
474000	477000	But if you give it too much CIN,
477000	479000	Cancer cells are not so happy.
479000	481000	Does this tell us some
481000	484000	Potential therapeutic strategies?
484000	487000	If we can make the entire baseline
487000	491000	If the cancer cell becomes very unstable,
491000	496000	Is there a chance to find a way to kill this cancer?
496000	498000	Give a very typical example.
498000	502000	For example, we now know that the acupuncture point is a chemotherapy drug.
502000	504000	Acupuncture point
504000	506000	Cells may feel that
506000	508000	It may cause these so-called
508000	510000	A bunch of
510000	512000	The problem of cancer cell division
512000	514000	So there will be some instability of the cancer cell.
514000	516000	Of course, this is the current idea of ​​the cellist.
516000	518000	So true or false
518000	520000	There are still a lot of hypotheses to verify.
520000	522000	But I'm probably talking to you today.
522000	524000	The idea is probably like this.
524000	525000	The second question is
525000	529000	How do cancer cells produce unstable cancer cells?
529000	532000	If you look at the ACS or AAC website,
532000	534000	You will find that those cancer cells
534000	537000	Or tumor cells, that is, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
537000	542000	In fact, it seems that they are mainly not in the process of cell division.
542000	544000	If it is not in the process of cell division,
544000	548000	How does it cause cell division?
548000	553000	This is very paradoxical.
553000	557000	So our idea is
557000	560000	Will there be other ways besides genes?
560000	563000	Will it lead to the instability of the cancer cell?
563000	565000	After my doctor,
565000	567000	What I'm doing next
567000	569000	Mainly discussing
569000	572000	Does chemistry affect the instability of the cancer cell?
572000	575000	If you have any questions, you can interrupt me at any time.
575000	577000	First give an overview
577000	580000	There will be a lot of changes in chemistry during the tumor.
580000	583000	I have listed four possible points of change here.
583000	586000	I can't talk too much because this is what I'm doing.
586000	589000	But I will try to connect what I used to do.
589000	592000	For example, in the process of cancer cells,
592000	594000	In fact, it is with its neighbor,
594000	600000	The force of contact with the cell next to it will begin to decrease.
600000	606000	Then, the tumor will begin to accumulate some so-called cells near it.
606000	608000	So the tumor will begin to mutate.
608000	610000	Then, in the process of cell division,
610000	612000	This cell will also begin to mutate.
613000	619000	There are three obvious chemical changes in the process of tumor development.
619000	623000	In addition, for example, like the liver cell.
623000	625000	Let's change the system a little bit.
625000	628000	In addition to the process of tumor development,
628000	630000	In addition to the mutation of cells,
630000	635000	Sometimes a lot of liver cells accumulate some fat.
635000	637000	This fat is obvious.
637000	639000	For example, in the process of fatty liver,
639000	641000	The liver will accumulate some fat.
642000	643000	Then we want to say,
643000	647000	For example, some so-called changes in the nature of cells,
647000	652000	Will it cause some changes in the chemistry of the entire cell?
652000	654000	And thus cause an unstable cancer cell.
656000	658000	How do I think about this problem?
658000	663000	I use this New York magazine cover as a comparison.
663000	665000	We know that cell division,
665000	669000	I just talked about a lot of processes that are related to the body.
669000	671000	How do we think about this problem?
671000	673000	Because we study cell division.
673000	675000	Our perspective is the same as this New Yorker.
675000	677000	This is New York 40 years ago,
677000	679000	New York 45 years ago.
679000	681000	The New Yorker's idea is like this.
681000	683000	I live in the egg yolk area.
683000	686000	Many buildings near the egg yolk area,
686000	688000	Many sell some desserts,
688000	690000	Of course I know.
690000	691000	After a while,
691000	694000	Maybe it's a little bit of a little bit of a place.
694000	695000	Then go a little further,
695000	696000	Passing the Hudson River,
696000	698000	I don't seem to care about other places in the United States.
698000	701000	Especially after the Pacific Ocean,
701000	703000	There are still many strange countries.
703000	705000	It has nothing to do with my life.
705000	708000	I'm not talking about New York.
708000	709000	I mean,
709000	711000	Our cell biology is also like this.
711000	714000	I am now studying the process of cell division.
714000	716000	Of course I care about the oxidant.
716000	717000	It's related to the oxidant.
717000	718000	For example, the point of interference,
718000	720000	Those things.
720000	721000	It may be very important.
721000	723000	I may know him a little bit.
723000	725000	This spindle pole seems to be a little bit important.
725000	726000	It's a little bit less important.
726000	727000	Then I...
727000	729000	Okay, let's take a look at it.
729000	730000	Like Cortex,
730000	731000	Extracellular Matrix,
731000	732000	Far away,
732000	734000	Maybe I don't have to look at it at all.
734000	735000	At least in the past few years,
735000	738000	Everyone is not so serious about this thing.
738000	739000	One of the reasons is because it's too far away.
739000	741000	Another point is because this system is in
741000	744000	Ah, the area below this area is already complicated enough.
744000	745000	You have to add these things.
745000	747000	Maybe this system can't go either.
747000	749000	Ah, you can't get one either.
749000	752000	Some conclusions.
752000	754000	But now the technology has advanced.
754000	755000	I'm starting to know that
755000	766000	In fact, the
766000	767000	That's what I'm going to talk about next.
767000	769000	In order to make this
769000	770000	Cellular matrix,
770000	772000	What about the matrix?
772000	774000	Hey, I especially want to focus on this so-called
774000	777000	Because there are a lot of proteins on the spindle itself.
777000	780000	Spindle itself will also produce force.
780000	781000	So we want to say,
781000	782000	Hey, if there's a force here,
782000	785000	Will it be a very interesting and efficient system?
785000	786000	Can let
786000	788000	Do some communication between the cells and the cells.
788000	790000	As a result, it affects the split of the protein.
790000	793000	Okay, now I'm going to start talking.
793000	795000	I'm really studying the subject.
795000	797000	Ah, start with the English title.
797000	800000	So I want to introduce the so-called
800000	801000	Ah.
801000	803000	The intersection point.
803000	804000	Between the two intersections.
804000	806000	In fact, there is a so-called tension between it.
806000	807000	What about this tension?
807000	808000	We call it Interconnection Tension.
808000	810000	It is a very important signal.
810000	811000	What about this signal?
811000	813000	Ah, you can tell the cells.
813000	816000	Hey, is this dyeing body correct?
816000	817000	Align.
817000	818000	Or is it aligned?
818000	821000	Is it aligned with a block?
821000	822000	So,
822000	823000	Ah,
823000	824000	Cells,
824000	825000	Ah,
825000	826000	So,
826000	828000	You can imagine it as a dyeing body.
828000	829000	It's a kind of spring.
829000	831000	There is a kind of spring between the two.
831000	832000	Between these two intersections.
832000	834000	That's because the matrix is pulling it.
834000	836000	So if it's lined up very well,
836000	838000	It will pull more.
838000	839000	What if it's him?
839000	840000	If it's not lined up,
840000	841000	That's because he.
841000	842000	For example, like this one.
842000	843000	The matrix is all on the same side.
843000	844000	Then he might be on both sides.
844000	846000	It will be closer.
846000	848000	What about this one that is closer to the distance?
848000	849000	Hey, or is this force bigger?
849000	850000	Or is it smaller?
850000	852000	You can tell us the cells.
852000	854000	Hey, is this dyeing body the correct arrangement?
854000	855000	Or is it a wrong arrangement?
855000	856000	Ah, this is from the cells.
856000	857000	Know that this is right.
857000	858000	This is wrong.
858000	859000	What about it?
859000	860000	Then he will use a system.
860000	862000	Ah, there are actually many systems.
862000	865000	But the main system is the so-called Aurora B.
865000	866000	Kines.
866000	867000	This system.
867000	868000	What about Kines?
868000	870000	Kines is a phosphatidylmethane.
870000	872000	That is, it can be added to the protein.
872000	874000	Phosphatidylmethane.
874000	875000	Phosphatidylmethane.
875000	877000	What about this?
877000	879000	If you add phosphatidylmethane to it,
879000	881000	Hey, you'll find that this is the point.
881000	884000	The interaction between that matrix seems to be weak.
884000	885000	So the idea.
885000	886000	So the whole.
886000	888000	Ah, the so-called spirit of the error correction.
888000	889000	It's like this.
889000	890000	That is to say.
890000	892000	Hey, this place is wrong.
892000	893000	Then I'll try to get it out.
893000	894000	After that?
894000	896000	This dye system can be rearranged again.
896000	897000	Ah, if there is still a problem.
897000	898000	Let's do it again.
898000	900000	That until the whole system is well arranged.
900000	901000	After that, the cells can say.
901000	903000	Hey, let's keep going.
903000	907000	Okay, that's the so-called regulation.
907000	910000	Let's just call it upstream regulation model.
910000	911000	That is.
911000	912000	Li Li?
912000	914000	Become a upstream control mechanism.
914000	918000	Tell the cells that this place should be corrected.
918000	920000	This place may be good.
920000	921000	Then we don't have to correct it.
921000	923000	Okay, of course, behind this area.
923000	924000	In the past 20 years.
924000	926000	A lot of people have been thinking about this issue.
926000	927000	That is to say.
927000	928000	Hey, why is that?
928000	930000	This force will cause.
930000	931000	It can be a signal.
931000	933000	Then tell the cells that this is right or wrong.
933000	934000	For example.
934000	936000	Hey, maybe after you pull it away.
936000	937000	What's that?
937000	939000	Because the original B is in the middle.
939000	941000	So it's not easy to follow.
941000	942000	Pulled away from the dye.
942000	944000	Pulled away from the left point to do some interaction.
944000	946000	Or maybe after you pull it away.
946000	948000	There is a force, and then the force changes some protein structures.
948000	950000	So I can't do it.
950000	952000	This left point is a lot, a lot, a lot.
952000	953000	In the past 20 years.
953000	954000	A lot of reviews.
954000	955000	A lot of research articles.
955000	957000	They're all looking at this mechanism.
957000	958000	Ah, if you're interested.
958000	960000	You can refer to me.
960000	962000	I wrote a review with my post-doc mentor.
962000	965000	Ah, this review is mainly summarized.
965000	966000	Let me advertise.
966000	967000	This review is mainly summarized.
967000	968000	That is.
968000	970000	How do we use some chemical methods.
970000	972000	To understand the process of cell division.
972000	974000	Ah, there are some interesting ones.
974000	977000	The use is from a lot of different research.
977000	980000	They have some very insightful uses.
980000	981000	So you can refer to it.
981000	982000	Good.
982000	985000	Of course, the Austrian Regulation Model is great.
985000	987000	But he also has some problems that can't be solved.
987000	988000	For example.
988000	989000	Hey.
989000	991000	Like this at the beginning.
991000	993000	You have to say, hey, if he opens this.
993000	995000	Ah.
995000	996000	He has some problems that can't be solved.
996000	998000	For example, hey, how does he dye.
998000	1000000	If he doesn't have no interest.
1000000	1001000	It will fall off.
1001000	1003000	How did he go?
1003000	1004000	Ah.
1004000	1006000	How did he start to do interaction with the anti-water?
1006000	1008000	Because at the beginning of the interaction, the force was also very small.
1009000	1010000	So the force is also very small.
1010000	1012000	That is, by definition, this should also fall off.
1012000	1013000	So.
1013000	1016000	So there will be a so-called paradox like this.
1016000	1020000	The other point is that there is another mistake.
1020000	1022000	Like I said at the beginning of the time.
1022000	1025000	This focus point will be connected to different levels on both sides.
1025000	1026000	That.
1026000	1027000	Ah.
1027000	1029000	We don't know if this interest is.
1029000	1031000	How to deal with this problem.
1031000	1032000	Good.
1032000	1033000	So there are a lot of problems.
1033000	1035000	Austrian Regulation Model will have some problems.
1035000	1037000	Of course, he solved a big problem.
1037000	1038000	That.
1038000	1039000	So we put forward a hypothesis at this time.
1039000	1040000	That is to say, hey.
1040000	1043000	Will it be a downstream control signal?
1043000	1045000	Because the whole field is looking at his upstream control signal.
1045000	1046000	Then we say, hey.
1046000	1049000	Is it possible to become a downstream control signal?
1049000	1052000	To affect the function of Aurora B?
1052000	1053000	Good.
1053000	1054000	Then we have to know the function of Aurora B.
1054000	1055000	We have to know first.
1055000	1056000	Is he a downstream signal?
1056000	1058000	We have to know what the Aurora B function is.
1058000	1060000	There are currently two models being proposed.
1060000	1062000	This is what Aurora B can do.
1062000	1063000	The first model.
1063000	1064000	Everyone is.
1064000	1066000	Conceptually, everyone thinks he is right.
1066000	1068000	Is the so-called Release Model.
1068000	1070000	This Release Model tells us.
1070000	1071000	If Aurora B.
1071000	1073000	After the loss point is optimized.
1073000	1075000	This hammer will fall off.
1075000	1076000	So after he fell off.
1076000	1077000	Hey, look at this.
1077000	1079000	The loss point is empty, right?
1079000	1080000	What if it's empty?
1080000	1081000	That.
1081000	1082000	He can connect.
1082000	1083000	Have the opportunity to connect.
1083000	1085000	The hammer that came out on the other side.
1085000	1086000	Hey.
1086000	1088000	If this system is effective.
1088000	1089000	Then he can.
1089000	1091000	Quickly become a symmetrical array.
1091000	1094000	This model is very powerful.
1094000	1096000	The biggest problem is that there is no direct.
1096000	1098000	The evidence of cellular biology.
1098000	1100000	Confirm that this release model exists.
1100000	1102000	So, uh.
1102000	1104000	Since there is no evidence, let's just say it.
1104000	1106000	That a lot of.
1106000	1107000	Uh.
1107000	1108000	Protein storage system.
1108000	1109000	Invisible system.
1109000	1111000	In fact, it tells me that there is a hint that this should be right.
1111000	1112000	But.
1112000	1114000	Cellular biology has not really made it yet.
1114000	1115000	This.
1115000	1116000	This model.
1116000	1117000	What about cellular biology?
1117000	1118000	There are different models of life.
1118000	1121000	It has been proven that there are diplomacy models.
1121000	1123000	This is a bit special.
1123000	1124000	It's a bit complicated.
1124000	1126000	This model is to say.
1126000	1127000	Hey, if this.
1127000	1129000	What happens after the left point is oxidized?
1129000	1130000	This.
1130000	1132000	B, he will lower this.
1132000	1134000	The so-called lowering of this hammer.
1134000	1135000	In the process of lowering.
1135000	1138000	This dye will also move to spinopo.
1138000	1141000	When he moves to spinopo.
1141000	1142000	What about this spinopo?
1142000	1143000	There are some enzymes near spinopo.
1143000	1145000	For example, A is a good brother of B.
1145000	1147000	He will be responsible for it.
1147000	1148000	That is.
1148000	1149000	Is to find a way to put.
1149000	1150000	Uh.
1150000	1151000	This is the point of contact with the water.
1151000	1153000	The interaction is eliminated.
1153000	1154000	So in this model.
1154000	1155000	It's also very complicated.
1155000	1157000	This model basically tells us.
1157000	1158000	What about the Aurora B?
1158000	1159000	Mainly let.
1159000	1160000	The dye is moving.
1160000	1163000	It's not used to do error correction.
1163000	1165000	So the Aurora A is the error correction.
1165000	1166000	This.
1166000	1167000	With the beginning.
1167000	1168000	It's just that everyone's idea is not very good.
1168000	1170000	Because everyone knows that the Aurora B is the same.
1170000	1172000	There should be a problem in theory.
1172000	1173000	Because otherwise.
1173000	1174000	This is the reason.
1174000	1175000	I think.
1175000	1176000	The Aurora B is to do error correction.
1176000	1177000	But.
1177000	1179000	This is the model.
1179000	1180000	This model.
1180000	1181000	More.
1181000	1182000	Uh.
1182000	1184000	Some evidence in cell biology.
1184000	1186000	Okay, so what about our project?
1186000	1188000	There are two models.
1188000	1189000	Then we want to know.
1189000	1191000	The first model.
1191000	1193000	Does this release model exist?
1193000	1195000	The second.
1195000	1196000	Physics is.
1196000	1200000	Is it possible to control these two different.
1200000	1201000	Uh, function.
1201000	1203000	In order to do this.
1203000	1205000	Our most direct idea is.
1205000	1206000	Then we put the Aurora B.
1206000	1208000	See if you can stick it to the point of contact.
1208000	1209000	Then see how it works.
1209000	1211000	How does this cell deal with this problem?
1211000	1215000	How to connect the Aurora B directly to the point of contact?
1215000	1218000	We have this chemical optogenetic system.
1218000	1220000	This system has three components.
1220000	1222000	The first one is.
1222000	1224000	This probe has three components.
1224000	1226000	The first one is that it has a halo ligand.
1226000	1228000	It can interact with halo tag protein.
1228000	1231000	It has another TMP ligand.
1231000	1235000	It can interact with DHFR tag.
1235000	1237000	So in theory.
1237000	1239000	After these two probes are added.
1239000	1242000	This DHFR protein will be connected to the halo tag protein.
1242000	1244000	Then the two of them can do something.
1244000	1247000	In order to increase the time and space of special temporal control.
1247000	1250000	We added a cage on this TMP.
1250000	1252000	So the reason for this cage is.
1252000	1253000	Hey, look at the cage.
1253000	1255000	So this pink can't bite this pink.
1255000	1257000	Uh, peanuts.
1257000	1258000	Then.
1258000	1261000	When I use light to put it on this cage.
1261000	1262000	This one.
1262000	1263000	He can go to him.
1263000	1265000	Then at this time we can use light to control.
1265000	1267000	Interaction with this protein.
1267000	1269000	Then I just said that my main job.
1269000	1272000	The job is to connect that Aura B to the core.
1272000	1274000	So of course I hope to put this piece on Aura B.
1274000	1276000	This piece is connected to the core.
1276000	1278000	So I use this system.
1278000	1281000	Ah, we put this so-called.
1281000	1283000	Ah, this tag.
1283000	1286000	This so-called Aura B activator is called INBOX.
1286000	1287000	He is a.
1287000	1290000	He is an Aura B activator anyway.
1291000	1293000	Then in order to put this Aura B.
1293000	1294000	Aura B is connected to this.
1294000	1295000	Ah.
1295000	1296000	Outside the point.
1296000	1298000	Then we put this point on top of it.
1298000	1299000	We chose this.
1299000	1301000	We put HaloTag on this so-called.
1301000	1302000	Ah.
1302000	1303000	SPC25.
1303000	1305000	He is a point of contact protein.
1305000	1306000	What about doing this?
1306000	1307000	We can do it in a short time.
1307000	1309000	In about a few ten seconds.
1309000	1311000	Aura B is connected to the so-called.
1311000	1312000	Ah, the point of contact.
1312000	1313000	Then we can see.
1313000	1315000	Hey, how do the cells deal with this problem?
1315000	1316000	We.
1316000	1319000	Okay, so the first one I'm doing is.
1319000	1320000	Then let's take a look at Aura B.
1320000	1322000	If we connect to the point of contact.
1322000	1324000	Let's take a look at that.
1324000	1326000	Ah, if the point of contact is selected.
1326000	1327000	If the force is very.
1327000	1329000	If the force is very low.
1329000	1330000	Let's see.
1330000	1332000	How do the cells deal with this problem?
1332000	1333000	What about this reflector?
1333000	1335000	It's actually a dynamic balance.
1335000	1336000	The.
1336000	1337000	In this case.
1337000	1338000	He is a dynamic balance.
1338000	1339000	The process.
1339000	1340000	Ah.
1340000	1341000	I should introduce this system.
1341000	1342000	This system.
1342000	1343000	I put this.
1343000	1344000	Ah, this.
1344000	1345000	Ah.
1345000	1346000	Separated cells.
1346000	1347000	Add a so-called.
1347000	1348000	This.
1348000	1350000	Ah, this is a very powerful inhibitor.
1350000	1351000	This is a very powerful inhibitor.
1351000	1352000	After this inhibitor is added.
1352000	1353000	This cell will form these two.
1353000	1354000	The two will not be separated again.
1354000	1355000	It will form.
1355000	1357000	A very star-shaped.
1357000	1358000	A reflector.
1358000	1359000	What about this reflector?
1359000	1361000	Ah, this dye is on top of it.
1361000	1362000	He will.
1362000	1363000	He is his position.
1363000	1365000	It is a dynamic.
1365000	1366000	His.
1366000	1368000	The connection of the reflector.
1368000	1369000	He will pull him.
1369000	1372000	But there are some proteins on his dye.
1372000	1373000	For example.
1373000	1375000	These motor proteins.
1375000	1376000	He will pull him out.
1376000	1377000	So in theory.
1377000	1378000	Ah.
1378000	1379000	This dye is a.
1379000	1380000	Ah.
1380000	1381000	A reflector process.
1381000	1383000	That's why he's going to be here.
1383000	1385000	So if I put this Aurora B thing.
1385000	1386000	Stick to.
1386000	1387000	This place.
1387000	1389000	If Aurora B Trigger.
1389000	1390000	Ah.
1390000	1391000	This.
1391000	1392000	Ah.
1392000	1393000	The point of focus and the reflector.
1393000	1394000	That is, if he falls off.
1394000	1395000	What about this time?
1395000	1396000	You will win.
1396000	1397000	So he will.
1397000	1398000	This.
1398000	1399000	You will find out.
1399000	1400000	Hey.
1400000	1401000	Is the entire dye running out?
1401000	1402000	Relative.
1402000	1403000	If he triggers a decay.
1403000	1404000	That's it.
1404000	1405000	Because we know that the reflector decays.
1405000	1406000	Will produce a lot of pull.
1406000	1407000	That.
1407000	1408000	So.
1408000	1409000	If he triggers a decay.
1409000	1410000	That.
1410000	1411000	At this time.
1411000	1412000	This dye should pull inwards.
1412000	1413000	So we can start.
1413000	1414000	Ah.
1414000	1415000	The dye is going out.
1415000	1416000	Or go inside.
1416000	1417000	To explore.
1417000	1418000	Which model is right.
1418000	1419000	Ah.
1419000	1420000	This is our experiment process.
1420000	1421000	Is.
1421000	1422000	Hey.
1422000	1423000	This is.
1423000	1424000	For example.
1424000	1425000	This channel on the left.
1425000	1426000	Is a.
1426000	1427000	Ah.
1427000	1428000	Is.
1428000	1429000	The so-called.
1429000	1430000	Point of focus and.
1430000	1431000	I.
1431000	1432000	I also labeled.
1432000	1433000	That spindle pole.
1433000	1434000	On the right.
1434000	1435000	Is.
1435000	1436000	He can activate.
1436000	1437000	That.
1437000	1438000	At the time equal to zero.
1438000	1439000	You will find that.
1439000	1440000	Hey.
1440000	1441000	This one.
1441000	1442000	The system.
1442000	1443000	That he.
1443000	1444000	In the signal inside.
1444000	1445000	In fact, it is quite uniform.
1445000	1446000	But after t equals zero.
1446000	1447000	If you activate this.
1447000	1448000	Cell.
1448000	1449000	You will find that.
1449000	1450000	Hey.
1450000	1451000	This.
1451000	1452000	Aurora B or Inbox.
1452000	1453000	He.
1453000	1454000	Inbox or Aurora B.
1454000	1455000	He will stick directly to this point of focus.
1455000	1456000	In a minute.
1456000	1457000	This phenomenon can be completed.
1457000	1458000	That.
1458000	1459000	You find that.
1459000	1460000	Hey.
1460000	1461000	After he stuck it up.
1461000	1462000	The whole point of focus.
1462000	1463000	Go inside.
1463000	1464000	Okay.
1464000	1465000	So.
1465000	1466000	Hey.
1466000	1467000	We put.
1467000	1468000	We.
1468000	1469000	Uh.
1469000	1470000	Collect a lot of data.
1470000	1471000	Data.
1471000	1472000	Data.
1472000	1473000	Then we found that.
1473000	1474000	Hey.
1474000	1475000	In fact.
1475000	1476000	Most of the cells.
1476000	1477000	In fact, they all run inwards.
1477000	1478000	Ah.
1478000	1479000	Here.
1479000	1480000	Uh.
1480000	1481000	Coordinate.
1481000	1482000	A little change.
1482000	1483000	It means going up.
1483000	1484000	Ah.
1484000	1485000	In a minute.
1485000	1486000	Because.
1486000	1487000	In order to match the data afterwards.
1487000	1488000	So.
1488000	1489000	You will find that.
1489000	1490000	Hey.
1490000	1491000	Aurora B.
1491000	1492000	He will let the cells.
1493000	1494000	Ah.
1494000	1495000	This mk14.
1495000	1496000	mk14.
1496000	1497000	He is a.
1497000	1498000	Ah.
1498000	1499000	It will decouple.
1499000	1500000	One of the anti-Claustrophobic enzymes.
1500000	1501000	So I put.
1501000	1502000	I recoup mk.
1502000	1503000	Because he is.
1503000	1504000	Then he.
1504000	1505000	Also.
1505000	1506000	Also run inwards.
1506000	1507000	So.
1507000	1508000	If recoup Aurora B.
1508000	1509000	With recoup mk.
1509000	1510000	Tell us.
1510000	1511000	Similar.
1511000	1512000	If the phenomenon.
1512000	1513000	Then I can say.
1513000	1514000	Hey.
1514000	1515000	Aurora B.
1515000	1516000	Is not it.
1516000	1517000	Is caused.
1517000	1518000	Anti-Claustrophobic decoupling.
1518000	1519000	So.
1519000	1520000	It seems to be more correct.
1520000	1521000	At least in this.
1521000	1522000	He can also.
1522000	1523000	Be born.
1523000	1524000	Because he can decouple anti-Claustrophobic.
1524000	1525000	In fact, he can also be used.
1525000	1526000	To control some anti-Claustrophobic.
1526000	1527000	That.
1527000	1528000	This is also my future.
1528000	1529000	I plan to use this system.
1529000	1530000	To.
1530000	1531000	To explore some cells.
1531000	1532000	This is anti-Claustrophobic.
1532000	1533000	Some problems in mechanics.
1533000	1534000	But anyway.
1534000	1535000	This is our current.
1535000	1536000	No need to discuss this mk problem.
1536000	1537000	Okay.
1537000	1538000	So.
1538000	1539000	The second.
1539000	1540000	I want to say.
1540000	1541000	Hey.
1541000	1542000	Then I know.
1542000	1543000	Aurora B.
1543000	1544000	Will deploy.
1544000	1545000	Then.
1545000	1546000	If.
1546000	1547000	My second question is.
1547000	1548000	Hey.
1548000	1549000	If in.
1549000	1550000	Ah.
1550000	1551000	Aurora B.
1551000	1552000	Will do the same thing?
1552000	1553000	That.
1553000	1554000	In order to explore this problem.
1554000	1555000	I want to put Aurora B.
1555000	1556000	Stick to.
1556000	1557000	A.
1557000	1558000	Hammer.
1558000	1559000	Ah.
1559000	1560000	Stick to a.
1560000	1561000	On the point.
1561000	1562000	Another point.
1562000	1563000	I don't want to stick to it.
1563000	1564000	Then you can imagine.
1564000	1565000	If Aurora B.
1565000	1566000	Trigger.
1566000	1567000	Release.
1567000	1568000	Then.
1568000	1569000	At this time.
1569000	1570000	The other side of the.
1570000	1571000	That.
1571000	1572000	The anti-Claustrophobic.
1572000	1573000	Will pull the entire dye body to the other side.
1573000	1574000	That.
1574000	1575000	Relative.
1575000	1576000	If.
1576000	1577000	He triggered.
1577000	1578000	Deformation.
1578000	1579000	Then.
1579000	1580000	It's the same.
1580000	1581000	From the direction.
1581000	1582000	We can.
1582000	1583000	To explore.
1583000	1584000	Which model.
1584000	1585000	Is right.
1585000	1586000	Okay.
1586000	1587000	This is our example.
1587000	1589000	You can also look at this video.
1589000	1590000	So it's the same.
1590000	1591000	At the same time.
1591000	1592000	Hey.
1592000	1593000	This.
1593000	1594000	Aurora B.
1594000	1595000	It's a.
1595000	1596000	Ah.
1596000	1597000	Even distribution.
1597000	1598000	At the same time.
1598000	1599000	I'm going to figure out a way to.
1599000	1600000	Stick Aurora B.
1600000	1601000	To this one.
1601000	1602000	You.
1602000	1603000	You should be able to see this.
1603000	1604000	There are two.
1604000	1605000	This is possible.
1605000	1606000	Then I'll figure out a way to stick this one.
1606000	1607000	The point.
1607000	1608000	That.
1608000	1609000	Hey.
1609000	1610000	About.
1610000	1611000	A minute.
1611000	1612000	Less than a minute.
1612000	1613000	The signal is saturated.
1613000	1614000	After that, you'll find out.
1614000	1615000	Hey.
1615000	1616000	In fact, this.
1616000	1617000	Uh.
1617000	1618000	The dye.
1618000	1619000	He didn't run away right away.
1619000	1620000	He's still there.
1620000	1621000	After two or three minutes.
1621000	1622000	Slowly.
1622000	1623000	Run over.
1623000	1624000	Hey.
1624000	1625000	So tell us.
1625000	1626000	Hey.
1626000	1627000	It seems to be released.
1627000	1628000	It seems to fit better.
1628000	1629000	Is.
1629000	1630000	After you hit it.
1630000	1631000	It seems that he ran to the other side.
1631000	1632000	So it seems to be released.
1632000	1633000	More correct.
1633000	1634000	That.
1634000	1635000	I put it.
1635000	1636000	I.
1636000	1637000	We.
1637000	1638000	Let's take a look at 1m.
1638000	1639000	When this.
1639000	1640000	The dye.
1640000	1641000	After leaving this middle plate.
1641000	1642000	Let's fix this cell.
1642000	1643000	Then we take it to 1m.
1643000	1644000	Let's take a look at the bottom.
1644000	1645000	Hey.
1645000	1646000	Is it.
1646000	1647000	On both sides.
1647000	1648000	Is it.
1648000	1649000	Uh.
1649000	1650000	Is it.
1650000	1651000	Is it.
1651000	1652000	Uh.
1652000	1653000	Is it.
1653000	1654000	Is it.
1654000	1655000	Is it.
1655000	1656000	Is it.
1656000	1657000	Is it.
1657000	1658000	Is it.
1658000	1659000	Is it.
1659000	1660000	Is it.
1660000	1661000	Is it.
1661000	1662000	Is it.
1662000	1663000	Is it.
1663000	1664000	Is it.
1664000	1665000	Is it.
1665000	1666000	Is it.
1666000	1667000	Is it.
1667000	1669000	Is there a waterproofing on both sides of the magnetic point?
1669000	1671000	Then we found that if this.
1671000	1672000	Magnetism.
1672000	1673000	Ah.
1673000	1675000	If this magnetic point is connected to Aurora B.
1675000	1676000	Hey.
1676000	1677000	There is no magnetism above.
1677000	1679000	But if the other side, I did not activate it.
1679000	1680000	That.
1680000	1681000	So he doesn't have it up there.
1681000	1682000	Aurora B.
1682000	1683000	There are more than a dozen.
1683000	1684000	Several.
1684000	1685000	There are more than a dozen.
1685000	1686000	Ah.
1686000	1687000	Ah.
1687000	1688000	The so-called magnetism.
1688000	1689000	That.
1689000	1690000	Here is only one slide.
1690000	1691000	As it is only about 5.
1691000	1692000	But there are other times.
1692000	1693000	There are other.
1693000	1694000	The.
1694000	1695000	The.
1695000	1696000	So hey.
1696000	1697000	So Aurora B.
1697000	1698000	Activation.
1698000	1699000	It will really cause release.
1699000	1700000	At least in this case.
1700000	1701000	Okay.
1701000	1702000	Then you may find out.
1702000	1703000	Hey.
1703000	1704000	It seems that I found two different.
1704000	1705000	Ah.
1705000	1706000	Mouth to mouth.
1706000	1707000	Is.
1707000	1708000	Found two different.
1708000	1709000	Function.
1709000	1710000	So how do we discuss.
1710000	1711000	You see in the monopole spindle.
1711000	1712000	It seems to be a trigger.
1712000	1713000	Deprecation.
1713000	1714000	But in.
1714000	1715000	High tension or bipolar spindle.
1715000	1716000	It triggers release.
1716000	1717000	So we started to think.
1717000	1718000	Hey.
1718000	1719000	Is it.
1719000	1720000	Magnetism.
1720000	1721000	Ah.
1721000	1722000	What about the magnetic force on the magnetic point?
1722000	1723000	Will tell Aurora B.
1723000	1724000	To do this.
1724000	1725000	I'll explain to you guys later.
1725000	1726000	Ah.
1726000	1727000	Okay.
1727000	1728000	For.
1728000	1729000	Explore this.
1729000	1730000	Is this the problem of tension?
1730000	1731000	Then I just wanted to say.
1731000	1732000	Hey.
1732000	1733000	Let's use a.
1733000	1734000	Use some chemical drugs to go.
1734000	1735000	Ah.
1735000	1736000	To change his.
1736000	1737000	Ah.
1737000	1738000	Tension.
1738000	1739000	So let's use these two.
1739000	1740000	Inhibitor.
1740000	1741000	These two.
1741000	1742000	For.
1742000	1743000	You'll find out.
1743000	1744000	The distance from his defective point.
1744000	1745000	Lower.
1745000	1746000	OK, tell me.
1746000	1747000	That's what tells me that the tension is getting smaller.
1747000	1748000	Then we want to say.
1748000	1749000	When he was small, we sat on the same.
1749000	1750000	Do it again at the same time.
1750000	1751000	See if it gets the same different result.
1751000	1752000	Then our idea is to say.
1753000	1754000	Hey, I'm going to make this tension smaller.
1754000	1755000	Is that not.
1755000	1756000	This release.
1756000	1757000	Will be.
1757000	1758000	It's not easy to happen.
1758000	1759000	Ah.
1759000	1760000	What about here?
1760000	1761000	I did some tricks.
1761000	1762000	Because we.
1762000	1763000	We know that this inhibitor.
1763000	1764000	He.
1764000	1765000	It may also affect the department.
1765000	1766000	It's just two at the same time.
1766000	1767000	So we want to see.
1767000	1768000	Ah.
1768000	1769000	Explore a little more detailed.
1769000	1770000	It's just that we look directly at the release.
1770000	1771000	This.
1771000	1772000	Condition.
1772000	1773000	So we want to measure directly.
1773000	1774000	Release.
1774000	1775000	Some kinetics.
1775000	1776000	So how do we measure release?
1776000	1777000	Kinetics?
1777000	1778000	We know that.
1778000	1779000	This.
1779000	1780000	Like I just said.
1780000	1781000	That is, if I hit the dot.
1781000	1782000	After that.
1782000	1783000	This dot will be here.
1783000	1784000	Stop here.
1784000	1785000	Stop for a while.
1785000	1786000	Then start to go in the other direction.
1786000	1787000	So I just put this.
1787000	1788000	Ah.
1788000	1789000	This.
1789000	1790000	Trace it.
1790000	1791000	Record it.
1791000	1792000	You will find that it is probably like this.
1792000	1793000	What about the beginning?
1793000	1794000	When there is no fire.
1794000	1795000	The two sides are symmetrical.
1795000	1796000	But in the process of the process.
1796000	1797000	Hey.
1797000	1798000	The other side is gone.
1798000	1799000	So he's on the other side of the sea.
1799000	1800000	Go.
1800000	1801000	Then go to the end.
1801000	1802000	He will be near the extreme.
1802000	1803000	Stop near the back.
1803000	1804000	This waiting time.
1804000	1805000	Here.
1805000	1806000	Tell us.
1806000	1807000	Hey.
1807000	1808000	This waiting time.
1808000	1809000	Here.
1809000	1810000	Tell us.
1810000	1811000	Very useful information.
1811000	1812000	Because.
1812000	1813000	If this waiting time.
1813000	1814000	If it's too long.
1814000	1815000	It means that the effect of Orabi.
1815000	1816000	The efficiency is not very strong.
1816000	1817000	Hey.
1817000	1818000	That waiting time is short.
1818000	1819000	It means that the effect of Orabi.
1819000	1820000	The efficiency is very strong.
1820000	1821000	Then I just put this waiting time.
1821000	1822000	After collecting it.
1822000	1823000	Then I took a look.
1823000	1824000	Is there a case of medicine?
1824000	1825000	There is medicine.
1825000	1826000	Is.
1826000	1827000	The force is relatively low.
1827000	1828000	No medicine.
1828000	1829000	When the force is stronger.
1829000	1830000	Then we found out.
1830000	1831000	Hey.
1831000	1832000	Add medicine.
1832000	1833000	This is.
1833000	1834000	Or.
1834000	1835000	When the force is lower.
1835000	1836000	Ah.
1836000	1837000	The effect of Orabi is worse.
1837000	1838000	When there is no medicine.
1838000	1839000	Is.
1839000	1840000	When the force is stronger.
1840000	1841000	Hey.
1841000	1842000	His waiting time is shorter.
1842000	1843000	Tell me.
1843000	1844000	He is faster.
1844000	1845000	So we know that.
1845000	1846000	Hey.
1846000	1847000	If the force becomes smaller.
1847000	1848000	He will let.
1848000	1849000	The release.
1849000	1850000	The kinetics becomes slower.
1850000	1851000	Okay.
1851000	1852000	Today.
1852000	1853000	Give you a summary.
1853000	1854000	That is to say.
1854000	1855000	Hey.
1855000	1856000	We.
1856000	1857000	This.
1857000	1858000	Work.
1858000	1859000	Get a.
1859000	1860000	Result.
1860000	1861000	That is to say.
1861000	1862000	We think that.
1862000	1863000	The dye makes the force.
1863000	1864000	In addition to becoming an upstream signal.
1864000	1865000	It can also become a downstream signal.
1865000	1866000	He will release the microchip.
1866000	1867000	Just try to find a way.
1867000	1868000	The left point will leave with the anti-slip.
1868000	1869000	In addition.
1869000	1870000	He will also reduce.
1870000	1871000	Ah.
1871000	1872000	Anti-slip.
1872000	1873000	Then we found that.
1873000	1874000	In a situation where the force is very strong.
1874000	1875000	Hey.
1875000	1876000	Orabi will let the left point go.
1876000	1877000	Ah.
1877000	1878000	Go with the anti-slip.
1878000	1879000	Leave.
1879000	1880000	Go.
1880000	1881000	Combine.
1881000	1882000	That in.
1882000	1883000	In a situation where the force is very low.
1883000	1884000	Orabi will be more inclined to go.
1884000	1885000	Ah.
1885000	1886000	Go.
1886000	1887000	Reduce this anti-slip.
1887000	1888000	Ah.
1888000	1889000	Then we.
1889000	1890000	From a cell biology perspective.
1890000	1891000	How do we explain this phenomenon?
1891000	1892000	We know that.
1892000	1894000	There are two wrong ways in the cell.
1895000	1896000	The same.
1896000	1897000	The left point can be connected.
1897000	1898000	Ah.
1898000	1899000	These two left points can be connected to the same.
1899000	1900000	Ah.
1900000	1901000	Binopole.
1901000	1902000	Ah.
1902000	1903000	What if.
1903000	1904000	Orabi.
1904000	1905000	At this time, the cell has a problem.
1905000	1906000	The cell found that there was a problem with this dye.
1906000	1907000	Hey.
1907000	1908000	He will recruit Orabi.
1908000	1909000	Then at this time.
1909000	1910000	He will deploy microtubules.
1910000	1911000	At this time.
1911000	1912000	The dye can run to the pore.
1912000	1913000	In this case.
1913000	1914000	It can be immediately.
1914000	1915000	Directly.
1915000	1916000	Transmitted to.
1916000	1917000	In the middle of the cell.
1917000	1918000	So it will be arranged.
1918000	1919000	A little faster.
1919000	1920000	This is on the kinetic.
1920000	1921000	There will be some advantages.
1921000	1922000	That is, the cell biology.
1923000	1924000	But.
1924000	1925000	Another wrong way is like this.
1925000	1926000	This is a more serious mistake.
1926000	1927000	It is a left point to connect two.
1927000	1928000	Ah.
1928000	1929000	Binopoles.
1929000	1930000	This.
1930000	1931000	What about this situation?
1931000	1932000	We found that.
1932000	1933000	Hey.
1933000	1934000	In fact.
1934000	1935000	It seems like.
1935000	1936000	If you buy these three.
1936000	1937000	If it's the same thing.
1937000	1938000	In fact, it seems that there is no way to solve this problem.
1938000	1939000	What about in this system?
1939000	1940000	Because we think.
1940000	1941000	Hey.
1941000	1942000	Is it.
1942000	1943000	His tension is higher.
1943000	1944000	So, in fact, this.
1944000	1945000	Mistake.
1945000	1946000	Attachment.
1946000	1947000	In fact, it is in the way of release.
1947000	1948000	To relax.
1948000	1949000	You can also do this.
1949000	1950000	You can do this.
1950000	1951000	You can do this.
1951000	1952000	The wrong way.
1952000	1953000	Cut it off.
1953000	1954000	After?
1954000	1955000	He.
1955000	1956000	This system can become.
1956000	1957000	The normal.
1957000	1958000	Uh.
1958000	1959000	Process.
1959000	1960000	So, we think that zhang li.
1960000	1961000	Ah.
1961000	1962000	A very important.
1962000	1963000	A signal of downstream control.
1963000	1964000	Tell the cell.
1964000	1965000	To do this.
1965000	1966000	Or do this.
1966000	1967000	Ah.
1967000	1968000	In addition.
1968000	1969000	We can also explain.
1969000	1971000	Other problems that can not be explained.
1971000	1972000	Like I just said.
1972000	1973000	Hey.
1973000	1974000	I want to dye.
1974000	1975000	How did it start?
1975000	1976000	Connect.
1976000	1977000	Connect the.
1977000	1978000	The.
1978000	1979000	That according to the past.
1980000	1981000	The idea is to say.
1981000	1982000	Hey.
1982000	1983000	If he.
1983000	1984000	Orabi.
1984000	1985000	When the fire is very high.
1985000	1986000	He should fall off.
1986000	1987000	But we.
1987000	1988000	We can find out.
1988000	1989000	Hey.
1989000	1990000	In fact, he may not fall.
1990000	1991000	Because at this time.
1991000	1992000	You can also know that he is very low.
1992000	1993000	He.
1993000	1994000	He doesn't have any tension.
1994000	1995000	So.
1995000	1996000	After he connected.
1996000	1997000	In fact, he is not so easy to fall off.
1997000	1998000	So.
1998000	1999000	This.
1999000	2000000	We just.
2000000	2001000	Somehow.
2001000	2002000	That is.
2002000	2003000	Resolve this problem.
2003000	2004000	Hey.
2004000	2005000	I just talked about this.
2005000	2006000	If you have this.
2006000	2007000	Cell.
2007000	2008000	Uh.
2008000	2009000	If you are interested in the micro-surgery.
2009000	2010000	Hey.
2010000	2011000	You are welcome to refer to my article.
2011000	2012000	Yeah.
2012000	2013000	Just released today.
2013000	2014000	Okay.
2014000	2015000	So.
2015000	2018000	We know that the changes in the mechanics of the cells.
2018000	2020000	It will affect the instability of the dye.
2020000	2022000	So my main topic now.
2022000	2023000	It is to discuss that the skin.
2023000	2024000	Uh.
2024000	2025000	Just like I just said.
2025000	2026000	That is.
2026000	2028000	The cancerous process of the skin cell.
2028000	2029000	In the process of cancer cells.
2029000	2032000	In fact, there are some changes in the mechanics.
2032000	2033000	Then we think.
2033000	2034000	Hey.
2034000	2035000	For example.
2035000	2036000	Cell.
2036000	2037000	I just said.
2037000	2039000	Or the tension between the cell and the tissue becomes smaller.
2039000	2041000	Then everyone already knows that this process.
2041000	2043000	It may cause an instability of the dye.
2043000	2044000	Then let's think about it.
2044000	2045000	Hey.
2045000	2046000	I just explained it.
2046000	2047000	That is.
2047000	2048000	Cell.
2048000	2049000	The tension in the micro-surgery will also cause problems.
2049000	2050000	The tension outside the cell will also cause problems.
2050000	2051000	Then we think.
2051000	2052000	Hey.
2052000	2053000	The tension inside the cell and outside the cell.
2053000	2056000	Is there a certain degree of coupling?
2056000	2057000	The so-called connection.
2057000	2058000	Okay.
2058000	2059000	The other question is.
2059000	2060000	Hey.
2060000	2061000	What about the division cell?
2061000	2062000	I said.
2062000	2063000	It.
2063000	2064000	It usually becomes harder.
2064000	2065000	What about the cell tissue?
2065000	2066000	It also becomes more.
2066000	2067000	The cell tissue also becomes harder.
2067000	2068000	Then we want to say.
2068000	2069000	Is this process?
2069000	2071000	The hardening process of cell division.
2071000	2073000	It can help this cancer cell.
2073000	2074000	In.
2074000	2075000	In this harder environment.
2075000	2076000	You can go.
2076000	2077000	To split.
2077000	2078000	Because we also know that.
2078000	2080000	If you go to suppress this cell.
2080000	2081000	You find out that he.
2081000	2082000	It's like.
2082000	2083000	The dye can't be arranged in the middle plate.
2083000	2084000	So.
2084000	2085000	It will cause some split problems.
2085000	2086000	So.
2086000	2087000	Let's talk about this.
2087000	2088000	Hardening.
2088000	2089000	The hardening process of split cells.
2089000	2090000	From whether or not.
2090000	2093000	Let the cells grow in this harder environment.
2093000	2095000	This question is more like.
2095000	2096000	The problem of fatty liver.
2096000	2097000	That is to say.
2097000	2098000	We hope to know that.
2098000	2099000	Uh.
2099000	2101000	In the process of fatty liver or liver hardening.
2101000	2102000	Uh.
2102000	2104000	The inside of the liver cell will produce a UTI accumulation.
2104000	2107000	It will also produce some hardening accumulation on the outside.
2107000	2108000	Then we want to say.
2108000	2110000	These so-called constraints inside.
2110000	2111000	The outside of this.
2111000	2113000	Constraints of cell division.
2113000	2114000	Is it possible?
2114000	2115000	Is there some interaction?
2115000	2116000	Then it leads to the whole.
2116000	2118000	The cancer cell becomes the cancer process.
2118000	2120000	Of course, there is no so-called.
2120000	2121000	The study of the mouth.
2121000	2122000	Now I just feel that.
2122000	2123000	Hey.
2123000	2124000	Uh.
2124000	2125000	Fat liver.
2125000	2126000	Liver hardening liver cancer.
2126000	2128000	It seems to be a high-level mouth.
2128000	2129000	That.
2129000	2131000	So this part is still a bit like open question.
2131000	2132000	Uh.
2132000	2133000	Ah.
2133000	2134000	Then I want to be now.
2134000	2135000	That is.
2135000	2136000	This process.
2136000	2138000	In fact, there are a lot of people helping me.
2138000	2139000	Like, for example.
2139000	2140000	Ah.
2140000	2141000	Our lab.
2141000	2142000	There are two of these.
2142000	2143000	In fact, at the beginning.
2143000	2144000	Uh.
2144000	2145000	Helped me build a lot of systems.
2145000	2146000	So.
2146000	2147000	I'm just a human.
2147000	2148000	Will put.
2148000	2149000	Put these things in the end.
2149000	2150000	A process.
2150000	2151000	Just put it together.
2151000	2152000	So.
2152000	2153000	I have a lot of credit for this.
2153000	2154000	He.
2154000	2155000	He.
2155000	2156000	At least do a lot of work.
2156000	2157000	So I.
2157000	2158000	Save a lot of time.
2158000	2160000	Of course, I also have some work.
2160000	2161000	There are some people.
2161000	2162000	For example.
2162000	2163000	He is.
2163000	2164000	Do some organic chemistry synthesis.
2164000	2166000	He can synthesize those light.
2166000	2167000	Some of the light chemistry.
2167000	2168000	Uh.
2168000	2169000	Materials.
2169000	2170000	It can be used to make light.
2170000	2171000	Can be used to control.
2171000	2172000	That.
2172000	2173000	Because I can't do this myself.
2173000	2175000	So I have to give them a little credit.
2175000	2176000	What about the other one?
2176000	2177000	He is in a university in New York.
2177000	2178000	Ah.
2178000	2179000	Then they.
2179000	2180000	This lab.
2180000	2181000	It's amazing.
2181000	2182000	What about, uh.
2182000	2183000	It's amazing to do that.
2183000	2184000	It's amazing to do that.
2184000	2185000	Then we just put our sample.
2185000	2186000	After fixing it.
2186000	2187000	And then send it directly to them.
2187000	2188000	They can watch em.
2188000	2189000	Then, uh.
2189000	2190000	There's always going to be some beautiful results.
2190000	2191000	So I have to.
2191000	2192000	Thank them.
2192000	2193000	Of course, this.
2193000	2194000	The dust has a very strong.
2194000	2195000	Comma members.
2195000	2196000	He.
2196000	2197000	This.
2197000	2198000	Comma has five levels.
2198000	2199000	Including our level.
2199000	2200000	So these labs.
2200000	2201000	Some are doing cell biology.
2201000	2202000	Some are doing.
2202000	2203000	Ah.
2203000	2204000	Some do biochemistry, computer physics.
2204000	2205000	He has done bioengineering.
2205000	2206000	Then.
2206000	2207000	Let's discuss the problem of cell division together.
2207000	2208000	So I think these teams.
2208000	2209000	It's.
2209000	2210000	It's.
2210000	2211000	It's really strong.
2211000	2212000	So I, I highly recommend that if you're looking for a blog post.
2212000	2213000	You can go to these labs.
2213000	2214000	If you're interested in cell division.
2214000	2215000	You can come and have a look at the background.
2215000	2216000	And of course, there are some so-called, uh.
2216000	2217000	That's probably what I'm talking about today.
2217000	2218000	Thank you.
2218000	2219000	OK.
2219000	2220000	Thank you.
2220000	2221000	Uh, that.
2221000	2222000	What's the problem?
2222000	2223000	Uh, you still.
2223000	2224000	Hey.
2224000	2225000	I'm sorry.
2225000	2226000	I'm sorry.
2226000	2227000	I'm sorry.
2227000	2228000	I'm sorry.
2228000	2229000	I'm sorry.
2229000	2230000	I'm sorry.
2230000	2231000	I'm sorry.
2231000	2232000	I'm sorry.
2232000	2233000	I'm sorry.

2239000	2240000	I'm sorry.
2240000	2241000	I'm sorry.
2241000	2242000	I'm sorry.
2242000	2243000	I'm sorry.
2243000	2244000	I'm sorry.
2244000	2245000	I'm sorry.
2245000	2246000	I'm so sorry.
2246000	2247000	I'm so sorry.
2247000	2248000	I'm so sorry.
2248000	2249000	I'm sorry.
2249000	2250000	I'm sorry.
2250000	2251000	I'm sorry.
2251000	2252000	I'm so sorry.
2252000	2253000	I'm sorry.
2253000	2254000	I'm sorry.
2254000	2255000	I'm sorry.
2255000	2256000	I'm sorry.
2256000	2257000	I'm sorry.
2257000	2258000	Thank you, thank you.
2258000	2259000	Thank you, thank you.
2259000	2260000	Thank you.
2260000	2261000	Thank you.
2261000	2262000	Thank you, thank you.
2262000	2263000	Thank you.
2263000	2264000	Thank you.
2264000	2265000	Thank you.
2265000	2266000	Thank you.
2266000	2267000	Thank you.
2267000	2268000	Thank you.
2328000	2329000	So, I wanted to ask this question
2329000	2332000	because, around four or five years ago,
2332000	2333000	we saw this phenomenon,
2333000	2334000	especially in myosis.
2334000	2335000	It's...
2335000	2336000	or, I should say,
2336000	2338000	in ogenesis,
2338000	2340000	it only has one chromosome
2340000	2343000	that goes all the way to the next generation.
2343000	2344000	Then the rest three are omitted.
2344000	2345000	So, you'll drive, right?
2345000	2346000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2346000	2348000	Only one will remain.
2348000	2350000	So, when they're shown in rows,
2350000	2354000	some genes will sense that
2354000	2356000	it's arranged in the wrong place,
2356000	2358000	and then it will loosen up the whole process
2358000	2359000	and start over.
2359000	2361000	So, eventually,
2361000	2363000	it has a higher chance
2363000	2364000	to reach the next generation.
2364000	2365000	Yeah, yeah, that's right.
2365000	2366000	So, I'm curious,
2366000	2368000	in myosis,
2368000	2370000	is there another layer
2370000	2372000	to control it?
2372000	2374000	Or is it a very different thing?
2374000	2375000	Yes, there is.
2375000	2376000	We first...
2376000	2377000	About three or four years ago,
2377000	2379000	there was an article in Science.
2379000	2381000	It was written by another Japanese.
2381000	2383000	He mentioned that
2383000	2385000	he used mouse eggs to make the system.
2385000	2387000	You know, eggs are also used for myosis.
2387000	2388000	In M1,
2388000	2389000	after myosis,
2389000	2390000	it will be divided into four cells.
2390000	2392000	He found that some components
2392000	2394000	will make some of its genes...
2394000	2395000	will make some of the colored cells
2395000	2396000	more flat,
2396000	2398000	or the dead spot is more likely
2398000	2400000	to stay in the egg.
2400000	2401000	Yeah.
2401000	2403000	Then he found some phenomena.
2403000	2404000	For example,
2404000	2405000	for example, the iris
2405000	2406000	will actually have an asymmetry.
2406000	2408000	But this may just be the mouse.
2408000	2409000	I don't know if there is
2409000	2410000	such a phenomenon in the opposite color.
2410000	2412000	But I know the mouse has this.
2412000	2414000	Myosis will have additional controls.
2414000	2416000	For example, the iris will have an asymmetry.
2416000	2418000	Then its size...
2418000	2420000	The size of the left eye
2420000	2421000	will also affect its problem.
2421000	2422000	Because the size of the left eye
2422000	2423000	is like what we just talked about.
2423000	2424000	MKEG, Deployment,
2424000	2426000	will also have different activities.
2426000	2428000	So myosis is indeed more complicated.
2428000	2429000	So now everyone in this field
2429000	2430000	is actually mainly going that way.
2430000	2432000	Ah, I can't be a mouse.
2432000	2433000	I don't want to be a mouse.
2433000	2434000	So I didn't go that way.
2434000	2436000	I went the other way.
2436000	2437000	But your question is very...
2437000	2438000	On the point.
2438000	2439000	I have to say.
2440000	2441000	Thank you.
2444000	2445000	OK.
2447000	2448000	Questions?
2449000	2451000	Before asking questions,
2451000	2453000	please introduce yourself.
2453000	2455000	Everyone knows you.
2459000	2461000	I want to ask a question.
2461000	2462000	OK, please say.
2462000	2463000	I am an outsider.
2463000	2464000	But I still want to ask a question.
2464000	2465000	Oh, OK.
2465000	2467000	You just mentioned
2467000	2469000	the intercellular and
2469000	2471000	external cells.
2471000	2474000	According to my understanding of intercellular biology,
2474000	2476000	there will be a cell membrane.
2477000	2481000	The cell membrane is actually quite strong.
2481000	2484000	What is the mechanism for coupling?
2484000	2485000	I know that
2485000	2486000	there will be some holes on the surface.
2486000	2487000	It will allow some things
2487000	2488000	to enter the cells.
2488000	2489000	But I don't know
2489000	2490000	if this thing
2490000	2491000	may be some...
2491000	2493000	There may be substances in it.
2493000	2494000	But I don't know
2494000	2496000	the coupling of tension.
2496000	2498000	What is the possible mechanism?
2498000	2500000	This question is really great.
2500000	2501000	I have to say this question.
2501000	2503000	In fact, people in this field
2503000	2505000	are thinking very seriously.
2505000	2506000	But they have never thought of a way.
2506000	2507000	There is no good mechanism
2507000	2508000	to solve this problem.
2508000	2509000	Let me tell you
2509000	2510000	a few possibilities.
2511000	2513000	If you look at it from the perspective of mechanics.
2514000	2515000	Let's say this.
2515000	2516000	Someone in my class is doing this.
2516000	2517000	That is to say, you know.
2517000	2519000	In fact, the magnet will move.
2519000	2521000	And it will swing.
2521000	2523000	This process is because
2523000	2525000	there are some proteins on the cell membrane
2525000	2526000	that will pull it.
2527000	2529000	In fact, there are many groups
2529000	2531000	that have been doing this for more than ten years.
2531000	2532000	Many engineers have done this.
2532000	2533000	They found that
2533000	2535000	if you change the cell tissue on the outside.
2535000	2536000	For example, integrin
2536000	2538000	or those adhesion molecules.
2539000	2541000	In fact, the direction of the magnet
2541000	2543000	will change with the distance.
2544000	2546000	Of course, you can ask a question.
2546000	2547000	How did this happen?
2547000	2549000	It may happen
2549000	2550000	because these molecules
2550000	2552000	may cause some
2552000	2553000	small molecules to gather.
2553000	2555000	The small molecules are not actually magnets.
2555000	2557000	It's the cortex around it.
2557000	2558000	There is another cytoskeleton on the cortex.
2558000	2559000	It's called actin.
2559000	2561000	It may be in the process of gathering.
2561000	2564000	It also gathers those things that will connect to the magnet.
2564000	2566000	So it will relatively
2566000	2567000	zoom in on this path.
2567000	2568000	This is one possibility.
2569000	2570000	Another possibility is
2570000	2572000	some regulations like biochemistry.
2572000	2573000	For example, those molecules
2573000	2574000	will actually induce some
2574000	2575000	message transmission.
2575000	2577000	Those message transmissions may make
2577000	2581000	some signals of the entire cell.
2581000	2582000	For example,
2583000	2584000	it may make some
2584000	2586000	places easier to decompose.
2586000	2587000	At this time, the tension will increase.
2587000	2589000	So there are some
2589000	2590000	of these two models.
2590000	2591000	In fact, everyone doesn't quite understand.
2591000	2593000	But I already know that there is such a phenomenon.
2593000	2594000	That is to say,
2594000	2595000	what did you change outside?
2595000	2597000	In fact, the spindle pole will change.
2597000	2598000	Now our question
2598000	2599000	Actually, my question is not very
2599000	2600000	so-called
2600000	2601000	very
2601000	2602000	deep.
2602000	2603000	Everyone already knows this process.
2603000	2604000	I already know that
2604000	2605000	the spindle pole and
2605000	2607000	the magnetic core will be connected.
2607000	2608000	I just want to say
2608000	2609000	that these two pieces
2609000	2610000	are not
2610000	2611000	so-called interaction.
2611000	2612000	I'm just
2612000	2614000	adding another layer on that question.
2615000	2616000	I hope I have answered your question.
2618000	2619000	It seems a bit complicated.
2619000	2621000	I'm not a very good presenter.
2621000	2623000	So I try my best.
2625000	2626000	OK.
2626000	2628000	Actually, I have another question.
2628000	2629000	But
2629000	2632000	let the audience ask first.
2632000	2637000	Is there any other questions from the audience on the spot?
2637000	2639000	Hello.
2639000	2641000	Please say hello.
2641000	2642000	I am Zhou Jia.
2642000	2643000	I am Zhou Jia.
2643000	2645000	I am from Bristol University in the UK.
2645000	2648000	I also do cell biology.
2648000	2651000	My own research has touched on some active parts.
2651000	2652000	So I'm curious.
2652000	2654000	Because in your project,
2654000	2655000	you mentioned that
2655000	2657000	the tension between cells
2657000	2658000	will affect
2658000	2659000	the performance of magnetism.
2659000	2661000	So when you train cells,
2661000	2663000	will you particularly consider using
2663000	2664000	some different software?
2664000	2665000	Or
2665000	2667000	will you specifically set
2667000	2670000	the confluence of specific cells?
2670000	2672000	In fact, maybe cell contact or no contact
2672000	2674000	may affect the performance of some cells.
2674000	2676000	Because when I do experiments myself,
2676000	2678000	I seem to encounter this kind of trouble.
2678000	2679000	Yes. OK.
2679000	2680000	I have to say that
2680000	2682000	when you were doing cell experiments in the past,
2682000	2683000	let me tell you first.
2683000	2685000	There are several points to discuss.
2685000	2686000	The first point
2686000	2688000	is what cells are different and what cells are not different.
2688000	2690000	I believe that different cells will have different differences.
2690000	2692000	Because what we use is
2692000	2693000	what I just said
2693000	2694000	outside will affect inside
2694000	2695000	that cell
2695000	2697000	is actually the primary cell.
2697000	2698000	This is the mouse's membrane cell.
2698000	2700000	Then it is raised in 3D culture.
2700000	2702000	So I believe that they feel that
2702000	2704000	there is such a coupling.
2704000	2705000	If you are studying
2705000	2707000	the so-called general cell line,
2707000	2708000	you know that the cell line has been isolated
2708000	2709000	and raised for several generations.
2709000	2710000	Basically, we think that
2710000	2712000	it should be adapted.
2712000	2714000	It has adapted to this environment.
2714000	2715000	So at this time,
2715000	2716000	the coupling may not be so strong.
2716000	2718000	Because it can split itself.
2718000	2719000	Because if it can't go through that,
2719000	2721000	it can't survive.
2721000	2723000	So there are some selection processes.
2723000	2724000	So
2724000	2725000	I think
2725000	2726000	but recently
2726000	2728000	someone started to discuss this issue.
2728000	2730000	For example,
2730000	2732000	I know that Sample has a group.
2732000	2734000	I just started the lab recently.
2734000	2735000	He is discussing that
2735000	2736000	cells will become longer
2736000	2738000	in the process of classification.
2738000	2739000	As I just said,
2739000	2740000	Anaphase will actually become longer.
2740000	2741000	This process
2741000	2742000	is actually very important.
2742000	2743000	Then he did a
2743000	2744000	more harsh approach.
2744000	2746000	He just tried to make the cell
2746000	2747000	become super hard.
2747000	2748000	So hard that
2748000	2749000	cells can't do
2749000	2751000	the work of prostitution.
2751000	2752000	You will find that
2752000	2754000	there is also a strange phenomenon in the mouse.
2754000	2755000	I think this is quite abnormal.
2755000	2757000	But I think it's quite interesting.
2757000	2758000	So actually
2758000	2759000	the direction you just mentioned
2759000	2760000	is exactly
2760000	2761000	what people have been doing
2761000	2762000	in the past five years.
2762000	2763000	After technology has matured,
2763000	2764000	people started to study.
2764000	2765000	But it's mainly
2765000	2766000	about
2766000	2767000	cells
2767000	2768000	and the so-called
2768000	2770000	3D culture.
2770000	2772000	I hope I answered your question.
2772000	2773000	Yes, thank you.
2773000	2774000	Sorry.
2774000	2776000	I want to follow up on a question.
2776000	2777000	Because
2777000	2778000	what we just talked about
2778000	2779000	is like
2779000	2780000	white blood cells.
2780000	2781000	Especially like cancer.
2781000	2782000	If you look at it,
2782000	2783000	will it have
2783000	2785000	a very different mechanism on it?
2785000	2786000	Good question.
2786000	2787000	Yes.
2787000	2788000	So according to
2788000	2789000	the article I just mentioned,
2789000	2790000	what you just said is
2790000	2791000	I use breast cells, right?
2791000	2793000	That work is actually
2793000	2795000	a group from MIT.
2795000	2796000	But that PI
2796000	2798000	seems to have died
2798000	2799000	in the past year or two.
2799000	2800000	But this is a bit unfortunate.
2800000	2801000	That group
2801000	2802000	made a lot of cells.
2802000	2803000	It found that
2803000	2804000	what you said is right.
2804000	2806000	If it was originally in the blood,
2806000	2807000	it doesn't need
2807000	2808000	cell proliferation.
2808000	2810000	Then it won't have this phenomenon.
2810000	2812000	But if it's breast or liver,
2812000	2814000	it has this phenomenon.
2814000	2816000	So it looks like different cells
2816000	2818000	live in different environments.
2818000	2820000	Indeed, there will be different responses.
2820000	2822000	You have a good intuition.
2822000	2823000	Thank you, thank you.
2827000	2828000	OK.
2828000	2829000	My friends didn't ask any questions.
2829000	2830000	Strange.
2833000	2835000	Do you have any more questions?
2836000	2838000	If not,
2838000	2840000	I will turn off the microphone
2840000	2842000	and turn off the video later.
2842000	2843000	Before turning off the video,
2843000	2845000	please turn on the microphone first.
2845000	2847000	Let's give a round of applause
2847000	2849000	to thank Geng Yuan's speech.
2855000	2857000	You should be able to hear
2857000	2859000	the sound of the video being turned off.
2859000	2860000	Thank you.
2860000	2861000	Thank you.
2861000	2862000	Thank you.
2862000	2863000	Thank you.
2864000	2865000	Thank you.
2865000	2866000	Thank you.
2866000	2867000	Thank you.
2876000	2877000	Thank you.
2878000	2879000	Thank you.
2885000	2886000	Thank you.
2887000	2888000	Thank you.
2888000	2889000	Thank you.
2889000	2890000	Thank you.
