00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I am the host of today's Taira Talk on September 18th, Hong Shih-an.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are very happy to invite the Sky in the World comedy science team to share with you the spirit of science communication.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Like Taira, the comedy science team is made up of doctoral students or post-doctoral students.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
They also want to promote the concept of science.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, what is different from Taira is that they are more towards the public,

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and they will share their life from a scientific perspective.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have personally listened to their podcasts several times, and I think what they say is very close to the life of a graduate student.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I highly recommend everyone to listen to their podcasts.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They also run a clubhouse.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Without further ado, let's get into today's topic, the spirit of science communication.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wallace, we'll leave it to you now.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, sure.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The stage is yours.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so I'm going to share my screen now.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Everyone has prepared a video.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let me know if you can see it.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you, Shih-an, for the introduction.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm one of the editors of the comedy science team.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm the screenwriter.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm very happy to have this opportunity to talk to you about science communication.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Seeing today's title, the spirit of science communication,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you may have a question.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What is the difference between science communication and science?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why do we need the title of science communication?

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's share our thoughts with you in the next hour.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Welcome to share your opinions.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, he can't go to the next page.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, here we go.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm Liu Yuru.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm the founder and editor of Sky Interworld.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My nickname is Wall, so you can call me Wall Editor.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My English name is Wallace.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a long name, I know.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sky Interworld started as a podcast and blog in 2006.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's kind of like my personal thing.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was originally alone.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When I went to the UK to study,

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was busy writing my thesis.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's been a while since then.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I came back to Taiwan in 2019.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I joined the overseas talent bridge project called LIFT.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I met a lot of super cool overseas Taiwanese,

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
including Xiao Ji, Dou Dou, CBN, and so on.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So did Adam.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The most important thing is that I found this group of friends.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We are willing to make an impact

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and do something for Taiwan.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's reopen the Sky Interworld podcast.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
For more than a year,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we've been running Facebook, Instagram,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
podcasts, and Clubhouse events on Sky Interworld.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We're very active on these platforms.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We have a lot of articles.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We have a podcast every week.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We also have a book club every month on Clubhouse.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We also have other editors

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
coming to play with us.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We currently have eight permanent editors,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
including myself.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll be sharing with you later

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xiao Ji, CBN, CS, CBN, and Dou Dou.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let me tell you about your locations.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Xiao Ji is in Milan, Italy.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
CS is in the east coast of the United States.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Dou Dou is in Paris, France.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Adam is in the west coast of the United States.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
CBN is in Switzerland.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alan is in the north of Taiwan.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
CBN is in the Czech Republic.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Most of us are postdoctoral researchers

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or teachers at school.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Our articles are also posted

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
on different platforms.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
For example, Science News,

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
National Daily, and World News.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know why World News likes us.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Some of these events

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
have attracted a lot of attention.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Some people are willing to jump in

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and join us.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
For example,

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
a marine biologist

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
at the coast of Maryland.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He is a senior

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in the US marine policy.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He is a senior.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A British citizen

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
will also join us

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
at Clubhouse.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sometimes he will join our recording.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Last week,

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tyra gave a talk.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She is a senior

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
in the Netherlands.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She is a senior in higher education.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
She is also a very important

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
source of advice and help.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The article and podcast

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
published by Sky in the World

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
are all from academic journals.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The content of the podcast

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
includes food and science,

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
interviews with people

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
who care about cancer development,

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
a doctor's seminar

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
for researchers,

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and a fitness seminar

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
for everyone's health.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Adam is the host.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The content of the article

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
includes interesting research,

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
academic work,

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
environmental-related reports,

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and support for cancer development in academia.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The purpose of the article

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is to promote the scientific logic

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and spirit of the article

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
through humor.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The translation of the article

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
will be different.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For example,

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Michael Bonkowski

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
will be translated as

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Michael Collision Driver.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Elizabeth Beak

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
will be translated as

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Elizabeth Beak.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The purpose of the article

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is to promote

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the scientific logic

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and spirit of the article

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
through humor.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
In addition,

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we hope that

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
everyone will pay attention

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to the article.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sometimes it will be dissed,

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
sometimes it will be praised.

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The reaction is a bit two-dimensional,

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but at the same time,

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it also creates a topic.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The purpose of the article

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
is to promote

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the scientific logic

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and spirit of the article

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
through humor.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The purpose of the article

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is to promote

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the scientific logic

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and spirit of the article

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
through humor.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We do not make any profit

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
by doing this.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Of course,

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
those who support us

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
will be very happy.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But we do not make any profit

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
by doing this.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's start with

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the history of science.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In January 1665,

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
the French emperor Louis XIV

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
was called Colbert.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In order to honor

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the Sun King,

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
he published the first

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
academic journal,

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
which you can see

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
in the upper left corner.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Its translation is

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
called The Scholar's Journal.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In March of the same year,

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the Royal Academy of Sciences

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
also began a report on natural science.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was the beginning of

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
scientific dissemination,

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the beginning of scientific journals.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In the scientific field

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
of scientists,

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
they began to communicate

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
with each other.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
At that time,

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in Europe in the 17th century,

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
science was already developed

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
in the Roman era.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There was no need

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to challenge existing knowledge.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Therefore,

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
many scientific experiments

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and new ideas

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
came from science

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
as an entertainment activity

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
for the rich.

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why do we need money?

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Look at the picture

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
below,

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the boy and the girl.

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The girl is his wife.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The experiment equipment

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
on the table in front

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is made of glass.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The glass is so big

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that it blows into

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
various strange shapes.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
At that time,

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it was very expensive,

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
so only the upper class

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
would play with it.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Of course,

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
such scientific dissemination

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
was only limited to

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
the upper class.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
However,

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
with the rapid development of science,

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
science is no longer

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
just an entertainment activity

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
for the rich.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It will become a factor

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that affects life in all aspects.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
From the change of people's lifestyle

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to the formation of public policy,

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
modern people need

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
scientific logic and concepts

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to avoid becoming a bright world

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that leads everyone

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to become scientific journalists.

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In Taiwan,

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
there is no such thing.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When you hear the word

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
science,

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
people think it's nonsense.

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For example,

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
people are waiting

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to hear some useless

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
British research.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I also watched the ad

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
of Vogue magazine.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I was very curious

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
about the science of fashion.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When I was teaching Vogue,

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I thought

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the word science

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
had been misused.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
At that time,

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought I should buy

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
a new dictionary

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
to see if the definition

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
of science had changed.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because science

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
had been distorted,

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
several editors

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
from Sky Inner World

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
decided to disseminate

258
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the concept of scientific life

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
in our lab

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
through various

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
social media platforms

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to attract more

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
listeners.

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
At the same time,

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
we also care about

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
friends in the academic circle

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and hope to share

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the opinions of the editors

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to help more friends

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
who are interested

271
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
in science and want to

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
learn more about

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the science of comedy.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hi, everyone.

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm Xiao-Ji.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
First of all,

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
if we want to make

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
science successful,

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we need to let the general public

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
know what PhD is.

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We need to know

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what PhD is.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is an introduction

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
from a professor in the US,

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
who introduces PhDs

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
every autumn.

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think this picture

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
is very interesting.

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think many people have seen it.

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's recall it.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
First of all,

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you see a circle.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This circle represents

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the knowledge of all humans.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Next.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You see a blue dot in the middle.

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is where we started

298
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to learn about the world

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We are in the middle.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Next.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
As we grow up,

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
we learn more and more knowledge.

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
From elementary school,

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
high school, and university

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to the university,

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
we start to have a specialization.

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Our knowledge starts to go in a certain direction.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
After the specialization,

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
we may have read a master's degree.

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Finally, we decide to

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
get a PhD.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
As our knowledge goes forward,

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
we have to face

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
the unknown.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
As we face the unknown,

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we work hard

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to study

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
what others don't know.

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
After many years of struggle,

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
we finally have a new discovery.

321
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Next.

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
As we move forward,

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the knowledge of all humans

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
takes a small step.

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This small step is

326
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
our life experience.

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Next.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
From our perspective,

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we stand here

330
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and look at

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
where the knowledge of all humans

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think I have made

334
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a big step.

335
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Next.

336
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
When we look back,

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we realize that

338
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the knowledge of all humans

339
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is very small.

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, the PhD is

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
right.

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We may call it

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Psychology.

344
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't like the name.

345
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On the other hand,

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
we are PhDs

347
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
because

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
we learned

349
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
how to

350
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
face the unknown systematically

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
learn new knowledge.

353
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We can apply

354
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
this method

355
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to other areas.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Even if we make a breakthrough,

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we can apply this method

358
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to other areas.

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We must remember this.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If we forget that

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
what we learned is not only professional knowledge,

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but also a whole set of research methods,

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
we will become advanced technicians.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We are just technicians

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
who know how to operate

366
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
strange machines.

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Next.

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
When we do research,

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
we need to face the unknown.

370
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We often say that we need to learn the ivory tower.

371
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It seems that what we do

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
has nothing to do with everyday life.

373
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Of course, we need to learn the ivory tower,

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but why is it there?

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It makes sense.

376
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Next.

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When we face the unknown,

378
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
no one knows the answer.

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
How can we find the answer?

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We can only make assumptions.

381
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We always make assumptions

382
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and try to prove it.

383
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We always end up

384
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
at the bottom of the theory.

385
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Even if we can prove it,

386
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
we still need to apply it in our daily life.

387
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is a big difference between theory and reality.

388
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
For example,

389
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am doing diagnostic research.

390
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We often say that

391
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
early diagnosis means early treatment.

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Early diagnosis is a great topic.

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I made a result.

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This result

395
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is a simple

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
example.

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
A week before a patient caught a cold,

398
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I knew he had a cold.

399
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I went to my boss.

400
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Boss,

401
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I found something.

402
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
A week before a patient caught a cold,

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I knew he would have a cold next week.

404
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can tell him

405
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
if he will have a cold next week.

406
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
My boss is a doctor.

407
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He told me that

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
it is useless.

409
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What if I have a cold next week?

410
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I said yes.

411
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There is a big difference between theory and reality.

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Theoretically, early diagnosis

413
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is a good thing.

414
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But when we apply it,

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
there are more considerations.

416
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Next slide.

417
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Second,

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
we want to quantify science.

419
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In order to quantify science,

420
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
we need a set of tools

421
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to tell us the final result.

422
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This set of tools is statistics.

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Statistics is a very powerful tool.

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But there is a limitation.

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
First,

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
when we do research,

427
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
we can't

428
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
study everyone.

429
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
For example,

430
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
if I want to study a patient,

431
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't study all the patients in the world.

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We may see a scientific article

433
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
about a breakthrough in cancer treatment.

434
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We successfully treated this cancer.

435
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you read that article,

436
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
they successfully treated five patients.

437
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can these five patients

438
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
represent all the cancer patients in the world?

439
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is the sample

440
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
we got today.

441
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Can the sample represent

442
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the entire population?

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Another example is

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
the presidential election.

445
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Before the presidential election,

446
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
there were many polling stations.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Polling is a different

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
example of the same country.

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This is the sample.

450
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If the voters

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
support this candidate,

452
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
the result will be different.

453
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Today,

454
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the first point of statistics

455
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is whether the sample can

456
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
reflect the reality of the society.

457
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The second point of statistics is

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
when we do scientific research,

459
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
we can see the difference in statistics.

460
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
In short,

461
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
it tells you that

462
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the result is very likely to be right.

463
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
In other words,

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
there must be a possibility that the result is wrong.

465
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Even if we

466
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
make a very beautiful result,

467
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
there is no way

468
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to be 100% sure

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
that the result is right.

470
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
In the development stage of science,

471
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
the key point is that

472
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we can't know

473
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
whether we are right or wrong.

474
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So when do we know

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the result is right?

476
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We have to wait

477
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
for different scientists

478
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
from all over the world

479
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
to test the result

480
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
in different ways

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to make sure

482
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that the result is right.

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
At this point,

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
we can apply the results

485
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to our daily lives.

486
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So today,

487
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
when we face the unknown

488
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
in front of the academic circle,

489
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
what we do

490
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
will really make a difference in our lives.

491
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Most of the things

492
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
we do

493
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
cannot be applied

494
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to our daily lives in an instant.

495
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But when we finally

496
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
make a mature decision

497
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to apply it to our daily lives,

498
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
we have to promote it to the public.

499
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's move on to the next slide.

500
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Today, we published an academic article.

501
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you think

502
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
about it?

503
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
First of all,

504
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
academic articles require

505
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
very precise writing.

506
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So today,

507
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the sentence must be clear.

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We can go back and read the paper

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and still can't find the sentence.

510
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The sentence is still in English.

511
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When you translate it into Chinese,

512
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
it's even more difficult to understand.

513
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But academic articles require accuracy.

514
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You really can't delete a single word.

515
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So it's a very painful reading experience

516
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
for most people.

517
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Second,

518
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
academic articles have too many

519
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
special names and are very long.

520
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So we start to abbreviate.

521
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't even know

522
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
whether it's an abbreviation

523
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
or an abbreviation.

524
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So for most people,

525
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it's really hard to remember.

526
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Third,

527
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
as I said,

528
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
when we write an article,

529
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
it may be overturned.

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Even if the probability is very low,

531
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
the probability that I wrote

532
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
1% or 0.1% is not correct.

533
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can't speak slowly.

534
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So we usually end up

535
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
writing that our research results

536
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
support the theory of A very much.

537
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But at the same time,

538
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
B and C may also be correct.

539
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
At the same time,

540
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
we do not rule out the possibility

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that D is also correct.

542
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So basically,

543
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
these three sentences sum up.

544
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In short,

545
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
if you see it,

546
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
you don't understand it.

547
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If we let scholars

548
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
directly talk to the public,

549
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
there will be a second question.

550
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
First,

551
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
when we talk about science,

552
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
we become scholars.

553
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Everything must be very clear.

554
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Everything must be very correct.

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So even the words we say

556
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
are almost the same as

557
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
the paper we wrote.

558
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So the public may not understand

559
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
what they see or hear.

560
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
In fact, the level of understanding

561
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
has not improved.

562
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The second question is

563
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The second question is

564
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Captain

565
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Captain

566
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We have technical issues.

567
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We have technical issues.

568
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The second question is

569
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
because we are learning

570
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
science today,

571
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it teaches us not to criticize.

572
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So as long as we hear something wrong,

573
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we immediately want to point it out.

574
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We are trained to ask questions

575
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
that are very clear and correct.

576
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Just like we talked about

577
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
in a previous podcast,

578
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
many people

579
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
start to get red

580
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
after eating seafood porridge.

581
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Many people say they are allergic.

582
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But in some cases,

583
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
they are actually poisoned, not allergic.

584
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So you can imagine

585
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that a friend came to me and said,

586
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Xiaoxi, I just ate seafood porridge

587
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and I'm allergic to red.

588
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What should I do?

589
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The point of this question is

590
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But when my scholar soul

591
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
came up, I heard this question,

592
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just wanted to tell him that

593
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
you are not allergic, you are poisoned.

594
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is very accurate and important to me.

595
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But this is not helpful

596
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
to the people who are asking for answers today.

597
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So I think

598
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
when we are in contact with ordinary people,

599
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
we must suppress our scholar soul.

600
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We have to be able to accept

601
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that maybe this question is very broad

602
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and not so accurate,

603
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
but it doesn't matter.

604
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If we get the information

605
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
he wants to know today,

606
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
can we give him a simple

607
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
take-home message after the explanation?

608
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
After listening to a bunch of academic analysis,

609
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
he can still have a very clear

610
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
1, 2, 3 to follow.

611
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then

612
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
if we find out today

613
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that he asked this question too broadly

614
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and couldn't answer it,

615
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
this is usually the case.

616
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Can we explain to him

617
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
how complicated this question is

618
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
so that the answer is not so easy?

619
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So next time

620
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
if he encounters any false information,

621
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
just tell him so simply.

622
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Maybe he can understand

623
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
that it's not that easy.

624
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because

625
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
this may not be true.

626
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Because I know this thing is very difficult.

627
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So in the end,

628
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
when we want to pass science to the general public,

629
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the most important thing is

630
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
the skill of speaking and the art of communication.

631
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is actually very lacking

632
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
in our doctoral training.

633
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But in fact,

634
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
in the future,

635
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
it is very important in life.

636
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This kind of communication is not just internal.

637
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We communicate with people in our lab,

638
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
with scholars in our field,

639
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
with scholars in other fields,

640
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and even with the general public.

641
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We all have different skills of communication.

642
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There are even those above and those below.

643
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I found something today.

644
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
How do I convince my boss?

645
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He must support me.

646
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
In addition to my professional skills,

647
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I also need to learn

648
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
the rules of science.

649
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
How do I pass this spirit

650
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to the next generation?

651
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So in the end, the most important thing is communication.

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Speaking of communication,

653
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
let's give the floor to CS.

654
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Have you heard my voice?

655
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes.

656
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't know how.

657
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

658
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CS can't come today.

659
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He has a recording.

660
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'll play it here.

661
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm going to share

662
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
with you

663
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the starting point

664
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
of Sky in the World.

665
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll share with you

666
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
the starting point of Sky in the World.

667
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sky in the World

668
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
has many hosts.

669
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Everyone is in

670
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
almost different countries,

671
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
even different time zones.

672
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Everyone has a different background.

673
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
In the interview

674
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
we invited,

675
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
in the interview

676
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we invited

677
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
very experienced

678
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
professors

679
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
who are about

680
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the same age as us,

681
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
but very good at teaching.

682
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We also found a position

683
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
for seniors

684
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
who are

685
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
older than us.

686
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Sometimes

687
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
through

688
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Facebook fan page,

689
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
we also met

690
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
people who asked

691
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
if they should study in a PhD program.

692
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Things like that.

693
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This kind of

694
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
horizontal communication

695
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
between peers

696
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and seniors

697
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
is a kind of

698
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
horizontal communication.

699
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
How do we

700
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
coordinate?

701
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
At the beginning of the sharing,

702
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going to ask

703
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
this question first.

704
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's on PowerPoint.

705
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
1 plus 1.

706
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What's the answer

707
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to this 1 plus 1?

708
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Some people might think it's 2,

709
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
a very simple number.

710
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Some people might think it's 2.

711
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Or some people might think

712
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
1 drop of water plus 1 drop of water

713
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
is a big number.

714
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Or 1 mouse plus 1 mouse

715
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
is a bunch of mice.

716
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
There are many answers.

717
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
When I first

718
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
joined Sky and World,

719
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
when faced with some questions,

720
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
my reaction was

721
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
2.

722
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's very certain.

723
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
There's no room for compromise.

724
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
In this world,

725
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
2 is the only standard answer.

726
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Then,

727
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I realized

728
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that other hosts

729
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
have a different

730
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
reaction from me.

731
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Why can they

732
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
ask questions

733
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
to so many people?

734
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Today,

735
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I started to

736
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
see how they

737
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
ask questions.

738
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I found one thing

739
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
different from my experience.

740
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What they think

741
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
is the connection

742
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
between their profession

743
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and the question.

744
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Or,

745
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
what's the connection

746
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
between their life

747
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and the question

748
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
we're going to discuss?

749
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a very special way.

750
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When I started

751
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to think in this direction,

752
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
when I removed

753
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the standard answer frame

754
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
to the scientific question,

755
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I also removed

756
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
the frame

757
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
from myself.

758
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I stopped thinking

759
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
about the standard answer

760
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
or the pathway

761
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
or mechanism

762
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
it should follow.

763
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I stopped

764
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
thinking

765
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
in a certain way.

766
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I also removed

767
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the frame

768
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
from others.

769
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think

770
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
they should

771
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
think in the same way.

772
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But I started

773
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
to accept,

774
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to discover,

775
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to feel

776
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
their way of thinking.

777
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I found that

778
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the question became so interesting.

779
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The question became so interesting.

780
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
In all sciences,

781
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
we introduce

782
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
history,

783
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
chemistry,

784
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
immunology,

785
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
or brain science.

786
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We often introduce

787
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
very special foods

788
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
that people have never thought of.

789
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We want

790
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the audience

791
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
to feel

792
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the same connection

793
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
between

794
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
their favorite

795
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
history,

796
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
science,

797
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or

798
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the life

799
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
they have never thought of.

800
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Some people

801
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
like

802
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
special things.

803
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It sounds

804
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
like

805
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
we can't find the answer.

806
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But if we

807
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
find it,

808
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it will be very rich.

809
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This is what I want to say.

810
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We should remove the frame.

811
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We should remove

812
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
the frame

813
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
that has been

814
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
in the academic circle

815
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
for a long time.

816
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We should think

817
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
how to connect

818
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the theme.

819
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We should

820
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
think through

821
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
other people's questions

822
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and thoughts.

823
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Why don't I have

824
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
other thoughts?

825
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This kind of thought

826
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
is very good.

827
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But science is a

828
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
subject that

829
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
we can think about

830
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
from various angles.

831
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We should

832
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
communicate with each other

833
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and

834
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
remove the frame.

835
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What about the audience?

836
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
When we face

837
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
many seniors

838
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
or

839
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
when we become

840
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
their seniors,

841
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
do we

842
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
remove the frame?

843
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Of course we do.

844
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We remove the frame

845
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
because

846
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
there is

847
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
a gap between us.

848
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Some people are up, some people are down.

849
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Sometimes we are down, others are up.

850
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sometimes we become

851
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
other people's seniors.

852
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Some people are up, some people are down.

853
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
In this case,

854
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
how should we

855
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
face the audience?

856
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Do we

857
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
have to listen to

858
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the seniors?

859
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Do we have to

860
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ask questions

861
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
or

862
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
ask our questions?

863
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
If we keep doing this,

864
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we can't do the program.

865
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We can't record the program.

866
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We can't give a speech,

867
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but we can't interview.

868
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What we did

869
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
was

870
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to remove

871
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the focus

872
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
from the position

873
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and

874
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
move to

875
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the topic we wanted to discuss.

876
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Whether it's a

877
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
science or

878
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
an interview,

879
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the topic is neutral.

880
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
When we focus

881
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
on these issues,

882
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
we can jump

883
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
out of the

884
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
top-to-bottom

885
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and

886
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
discuss a topic,

887
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
instead of

888
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
looking at what the elders

889
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
want to say to us.

890
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's not the same.

891
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We can still learn

892
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
from the elders

893
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
in the interview.

894
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
When we discuss

895
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
with the elders,

896
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
we can

897
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
also learn from them.

898
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
However,

899
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
learning is not

900
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
about who

901
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
should learn, who should listen,

902
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
who should share, who should listen.

903
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Instead,

904
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
this topic

905
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is very interesting.

906
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Let's think about

907
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
the starting point

908
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
for different people.

909
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What would it look like?

910
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In the interview,

911
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
we often

912
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
discuss

913
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
the topic

914
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
as

915
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
it sounds

916
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
neutral.

917
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
However,

918
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it can be

919
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
exciting.

920
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
In this case,

921
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
we can learn

922
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
how to

923
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
understand

924
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the atmosphere

925
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and the process.

926
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The most important thing

927
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is that

928
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
we can

929
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
discuss

930
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the topic

931
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
first.

932
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Then,

933
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we can

934
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
focus on

935
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the topic.

936
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This is what I want to share

937
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
with you today.

938
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Actually,

939
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
we have heard about

940
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
frameworks.

941
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Frameworks often

942
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
appear in our life.

943
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I want to

944
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
remind you

945
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
that

946
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
we should

947
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
learn from

948
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
the elders.

949
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Now,

950
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
let's welcome

951
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Ren.

952
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I want to

953
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
remind you

954
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that

955
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
we should

956
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
learn from

957
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
the elders.

958
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I want to

959
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
remind you

960
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
that

961
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
we should

962
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
learn from

963
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the elders.

964
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I am a health-related

965
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
scientist.

966
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I am doing research

967
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
on sports.

968
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We all know

969
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that

970
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
it is not

971
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
a matter of

972
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
one or two days.

973
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Many scholars

974
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000

01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
remind you

1775
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
that

1776
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
it is not

1777
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
a matter of

1778
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
one or two days.

1779
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I want to

1780
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
remind you

1781
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
that

1782
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
it is not

1783
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
a matter of

1784
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
one or two days.

1785
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I want to

1786
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
remind you

1787
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
that

1788
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
it is not

1789
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
a matter of

1790
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
one or two days.

1791
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I want to

1792
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
remind you

1793
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
that

1794
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
it is not

1795
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
a matter of

1796
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
one or two days.

1797
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I want to

1798
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
remind you

1799
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
that

1800
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
it is not

1801
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
a matter of

1802
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
one or two days.

1803
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I want to

1804
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
remind you

1805
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
that

1806
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it is not

1807
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
a matter of

1808
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
one or two days.

1809
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I want to

1810
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
remind you

1811
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
that

1812
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
it is not

1813
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
a matter of

1814
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
one or two days.

1815
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I want to

1816
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
remind you

1817
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
that

1818
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
it is not

1819
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
a matter of

1820
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
one or two days.

1821
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I want to

1822
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
remind you

1823
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
that

1824
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
it is not

1825
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
a matter of

1826
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
one or two days.

1827
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I want to

1828
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
remind you

1829
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
that

1830
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it is not

1831
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
a matter of

1832
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
one or two days.

1833
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I want to

1834
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
remind you

1835
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
that

1836
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
it is not

1837
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
a matter of

1838
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
one or two days.

1839
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I want to

1840
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
remind you

1841
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
that

1842
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
it is not

1843
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
a matter of

1844
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
one or two days.

1845
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I want to remind you

1846
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
that

1847
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
it is not

1848
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
a matter of

1849
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
one or two days.

1850
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I want to

1851
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
remind you

1852
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
that

1853
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
it is not

1854
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
a matter of

1855
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
one or two days.

1856
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Before we look into

1857
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
some of the

1858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
previous experiences,

1859
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
we hope

1860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
that we can

1861
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
invite

1862
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
more

1863
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
seniors

1864
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
to share

1865
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
their experiences

1866
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and thoughts.

1867
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Later, our audience

1868
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
may gradually shift to

1869
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
doctors or researchers,

1870
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
researchers and employees.

1871
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
However,

1872
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
we hope that

1873
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
the public

1874
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
will be able to

1875
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
see and understand

1876
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
what scientific debate

1877
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
looks like.

1878
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I know that

1879
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
a lot of people

1880
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
who study literature

1881
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
or sociology

1882
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
think that

1883
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
scientific debates are

1884
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
a bit deep,

1885
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but the jokes are funny.

1886
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I think that's enough.

1887
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I don't know if that answers

1888
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
your question.

1889
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Is Alan speaking?

1890
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I just want to

1891
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
add something.

1892
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Our team discussed

1893
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
that we need people

1894
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
with a literary background

1895
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
or an artistic background

1896
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
to discuss with us.

1897
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So,

1898
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
we don't mean

1899
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
to attack the literary community.

1900
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
They can understand

1901
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
these scientific things.

1902
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Absolutely.

1903
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Some of the people

1904
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
we often collaborate with,

1905
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
such as Clubhouse,

1906
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
we have invited professors

1907
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
from the Department of Philosophy

1908
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
at the University of Miami.

1909
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
This is a wonderful

1910
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
field of study.

1911
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
We can get to know

1912
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
a lot of wonderful fields

1913
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
through this platform.

1914
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
We've never thought about

1915
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
biotechnology or biophysics.

1916
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
We've never heard of them,

1917
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
but we've invited them

1918
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
so that we can get to know

1919
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
these different fields.

1920
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
This is a part of cross-communication.

1921
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Scholars from different fields

1922
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
communicate with each other

1923
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
through this platform.

1924
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
This is one of the things

1925
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
we want to do.

1926
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
This platform is very free.

1927
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
In today's presentation,

1928
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
the content is very free.

1929
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You can choose a topic

1930
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and go home to prepare.

1931
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You don't have to say

1932
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
what you want to say.

1933
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It's a platform

1934
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
you can use.

1935
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Any other questions?

1936
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'd like to ask

1937
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
a question about

1938
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
what makes you feel

1939
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
connected to the

1940
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Department of Philosophy.

1941
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I think it's about

1942
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
choosing a boss.

1943
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I've been thinking

1944
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
about

1945
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
choosing a boss.

1946
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
There was a talk

1947
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
by Tara

1948
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
from the Department of Chemistry

1949
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
in Houston.

1950
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
She said

1951
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
she had prepared

1952
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
a talk

1953
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
about choosing a boss.

1954
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I talked to her

1955
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
about it.

1956
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I think

1957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
we all have a common conclusion

1958
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that choosing a boss

1959
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
is more than 50% by luck.

1960
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
You've made

1961
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
a lot of decisions

1962
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
along the way,

1963
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
but sometimes

1964
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
by luck is a good decision.

1965
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I think

1966
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
it's okay.

1967
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I feel the same way.

1968
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I think

1969
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
the benefits of this platform

1970
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
are quite interesting.

1971
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
First,

1972
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I want to share

1973
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
these things

1974
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
so that people

1975
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
on the same path

1976
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
can have a better reference.

1977
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I also want to tell them

1978
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
that if you make a decision,

1979
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
it turns out that it's not a good decision

1980
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
and it's not your problem.

1981
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It seems like

1982
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
you have a lot of stories

1983
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
to share.

1984
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You're welcome to join us.

1985
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Actually,

1986
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Sky in the World

1987
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
has a good thing.

1988
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
These people

1989
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
have a lot of connections

1990
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
in their interpersonal relationships.

1991
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
We have some

1992
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
internal information

1993
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
about some

1994
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
recruits

1995
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
or job positions.

1996
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Editors

1997
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
will share with each other.

1998
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
If you join our team,

1999
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
you'll hear a lot about

2000
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
where to apply.

2001
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
My job now

2002
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
is to introduce.

2003
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Like you said,

2004
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
sometimes you

2005
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
accidentally throw it out.

2006
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Is there anyone

2007
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
you know

2008
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
who thinks it's suitable for this job?

2009
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Maybe some people

2010
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
catch it.

2011
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Yeah.

2012
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Go ahead.

2013
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I just want to say

2014
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
that I heard

2015
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
the podcast

2016
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and I felt very allergic.

2017
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
But there was a episode

2018
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
about the clinical trial

2019
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
and IRB.

2020
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I don't think it's right.

2021
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I really want to oppose it.

2022
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So I want to join this team

2023
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and discuss with you.

2024
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Yeah.

2025
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It's politically correct.

2026
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah.

2027
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Whether it's an article

2028
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
or a podcast,

2029
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
we welcome people

2030
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
to make mistakes.

2031
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
We don't always

2032
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
present our expertise.

2033
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So it might be wrong.

2034
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
If people are willing

2035
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
to make mistakes,

2036
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
it's a discussion.

2037
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I think it's good.

2038
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think science should be like this.

2039
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
You present it

2040
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and we challenge it.

2041
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
We present different opinions.

2042
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I agree with what you said.

2043
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I remember

2044
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
listening to

2045
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
the podcast

2046
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
about how to choose a boss.

2047
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I'm very similar to Sinda.

2048
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It's like

2049
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
a PhD student

2050
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
or someone who

2051
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
used to be a PhD student

2052
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
will have

2053
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
an interest

2054
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
in listening.

2055
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
If you think of

2056
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
a topic you want to listen to,

2057
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
you can throw it away.

2058
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Or you can join

2059
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
our PhD chat.

2060
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I have a lot of

2061
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Facebook fans

2062
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
who comment

2063
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
on the topics

2064
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
they want to hear.

2065
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
We listen to them

2066
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and discuss them.

2067
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
If you have

2068
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
any ideas

2069
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
or topics

2070
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
you think

2071
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
are worth discussing,

2072
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
you're welcome.

2073
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
You can also

2074
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
ask questions

2075
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
about your daily life.

2076
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
For example,

2077
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
what is sashimi?

2078
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Why can it be eaten raw?

2079
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Or what is cooked meat?

2080
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
They can just throw it away

2081
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
and we can

2082
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
make food science for them.

2083
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Sounds great.

2084
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I have some

2085
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
questions.

2086
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
How do you manage the platform?

2087
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It sounds like

2088
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
your audience

2089
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
is the general public.

2090
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But sometimes

2091
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
when it comes to

2092
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
PhD topics,

2093
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
it feels like

2094
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
you have to be a PhD student

2095
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
to want to listen.

2096
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
This audience

2097
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
looks like a PhD student.

2098
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
How do you decide

2099
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
in the middle?

2100
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
For example,

2101
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
what kind of audience

2102
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
do you have?

2103
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Do you have a balance?

2104
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I'd like to know how you manage it.

2105
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The podcast part?

2106
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Allen, do you want to answer?

2107
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I was just kidding.

2108
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Please go ahead.

2109
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
No, I'm just stressed

2110
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and bored.

2111
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You can continue.

2112
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
We're all funny.

2113
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2114
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
For the podcast part,

2115
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
we're quite

2116
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
familiar with

2117
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
the team.

2118
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
We have a LINE group.

2119
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Every week,

2120
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
once a month,

2121
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I'll organize the recording schedule.

2122
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
For example,

2123
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
we'll decide what to record

2124
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
on a certain weekend.

2125
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
We'll decide the topic

2126
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
we want to talk about.

2127
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's very simple.

2128
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
For example, food science.

2129
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
We'll throw the food on the table

2130
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
and cook it into meat.

2131
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Or, for example,

2132
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
we want to talk about

2133
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
academic ghost stories.

2134
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
We'll think about it.

2135
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Then,

2136
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
during the recording session,

2137
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
we'll have a chat

2138
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and talk freely.

2139
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
We'll say what we want

2140
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
to talk about.

2141
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Sometimes, the recording session

2142
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
takes a long time.

2143
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
But it's okay.

2144
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
We can edit it.

2145
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
For the audience,

2146
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
we don't have a specific

2147
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
target audience.

2148
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
But I have

2149
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
a separate target audience

2150
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
for each topic.

2151
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
For example,

2152
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
for food science,

2153
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I'll talk about science.

2154
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
For doctoral studies,

2155
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I'll talk about

2156
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
those who are on the path

2157
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
to become a doctor.

2158
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Or those who are already

2159
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
on the path to become a doctor.

2160
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And so on.

2161
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
For the gym,

2162
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I'll talk about

2163
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
those who are

2164
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
studying science.

2165
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Scientists

2166
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
don't have much time to exercise.

2167
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But Adam will

2168
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
tell everyone to exercise.

2169
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
So, listen to Adam's lecture

2170
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
once a month.

2171
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
He'll tell you to exercise

2172
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
for at least two or three days.

2173
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Just like me.

2174
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So, we'll use the theme

2175
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
to distinguish our audience.

2176
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
What do you think,

2177
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
editors?

2178
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I really

2179
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
don't care about

2180
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
these things.

2181
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I joined the team

2182
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
because I wanted to

2183
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
be a rock band.

2184
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I was very happy

2185
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
to join the team.

2186
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I've learned a lot.

2187
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
We're all from different backgrounds.

2188
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So, for management,

2189
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I'm the leader.

2190
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
For example,

2191
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Adam, Xiao Ji,

2192
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
they all run

2193
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Instagram and Facebook.

2194
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So, they really

2195
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
know

2196
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
the behind-the-scenes

2197
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
of the team.

2198
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Xiao Ji is amazing.

2199
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
She's the big manager

2200
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
of our Instagram.

2201
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I've been lost lately.

2202
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm addicted to mobile games.

2203
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Are you still playing

2204
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
the mobile game?

2205
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yes, I am.

2206
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
We have to be scientific.

2207
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I've been wondering

2208
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
if anyone is still playing

2209
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
the mobile game.

2210
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Xiao Ji said so,

2211
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
but our Instagram

2212
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
has almost 1,000 followers.

2213
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's been a long time.

2214
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
If I'm still playing,

2215
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I should have 1,000 followers

2216
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
last month.

2217
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I've been working lately,

2218
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
so I don't have much time.

2219
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Otherwise, we would have 5,000 followers.

2220
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
At first,

2221
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
some people said

2222
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
their social media

2223
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
would explode

2224
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
and 50 people would die.

2225
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We can't join.

2226
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We don't need to buy

2227
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
anything.

2228
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Only 10 people will come.

2229
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm sorry.

2230
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It's a cold joke.

2231
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Before we started,

2232
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Jason told us

2233
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that Tyra's speech

2234
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
would explode

2235
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
sometimes.

2236
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But we haven't

2237
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
encountered such a situation.

2238
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I saw a few viewers

2239
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
turn on the camera.

2240
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Do you want to ask questions?

2241
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yes.

2242
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Please ask.

2243
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Hello.

2244
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I'm a student

2245
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
at Tsinghua University.

2246
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I've been writing

2247
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
science fiction articles

2248
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and fan magazines.

2249
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I want to ask

2250
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
if you want to write

2251
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
science fiction articles

2252
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
for the public,

2253
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
how do you write

2254
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
so that everyone can understand?

2255
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I think what I write

2256
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
depends on

2257
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
what you've learned.

2258
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I want to write

2259
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
a story,

2260
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
a fable.

2261
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
You don't need

2262
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
to feel burdened

2263
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
to read it.

2264
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
If you don't like science,

2265
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
you'll want to read it.

2266
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What's your topic?

2267
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Which field do you prefer?

2268
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Animal behavior and neuroscience.

2269
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
That's so cool.

2270
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I want to read your fable.

2271
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I can't write it yet.

2272
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I think this topic

2273
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
is easy to use.

2274
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I think we can send

2275
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
CS and V to read it.

2276
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I'm neuroscience too.

2277
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Don't ignore me.

2278
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Xiao Ji is also

2279
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
neuroscience.

2280
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I write more

2281
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
in writing

2282
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
than other editors.

2283
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
But other editors

2284
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
also have free time.

2285
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
How to

2286
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
make a science fiction

2287
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
story more vivid?

2288
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Can everyone

2289
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
say something bad about someone else?

2290
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We're recording.

2291
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Let's cut it out.

2292
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We can't add anything.

2293
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Don't add anything.

2294
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
We're not

2295
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
doing a journal club.

2296
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
If we want to present

2297
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
an article to the general public,

2298
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
the best way

2299
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
is to use as many metaphors

2300
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
as possible.

2301
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Use all kinds of metaphors

2302
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
in everyday life.

2303
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You've already written a fable.

2304
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That's a good metaphor.

2305
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But sometimes

2306
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
when I'm reading a story,

2307
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
sometimes I can't

2308
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
connect with

2309
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
what I want to convey.

2310
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
You have to be smart

2311
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
to read the meaning of

2312
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
self-discipline.

2313
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I can't read poetry.

2314
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's useless

2315
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
to write poetry.

2316
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So I think

2317
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
you can use

2318
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
metaphors in everyday life

2319
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
to describe

2320
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
the scientific facts.

2321
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
For example,

2322
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
DNA and RNA

2323
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
will go through

2324
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
translation and transcription.

2325
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
You can say

2326
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
it's a translation of the past.

2327
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
There are too many

2328
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
metaphors.

2329
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You can say

2330
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
it's a dictionary.

2331
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You can say

2332
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
it's a code.

2333
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
You can say

2334
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
it's a protein.

2335
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You can use

2336
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
all kinds of metaphors.

2337
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Because you're writing

2338
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
about a field

2339
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
that few people write about,

2340
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
you can use

2341
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
innovative metaphors.

2342
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
What do you think, Xiao-jin?

2343
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
You sound like a writer.

2344
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I used to be a writer.

2345
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Maybe until I was 80.

2346
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I think

2347
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
you can use

2348
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
metaphors

2349
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
like Xiao-jin said.

2350
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
We have a lot of metaphors.

2351
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
The second thing I think

2352
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
is that you can

2353
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
use images.

2354
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Xiao-jin is good at

2355
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
animal behavior.

2356
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It's really interesting.

2357
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
He said

2358
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
animal behavior is like

2359
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
two

2360
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
ships

2361
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
mating.

2362
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
When mating,

2363
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
the third mate

2364
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
opened his hand.

2365
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
You might think

2366
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
it's boring.

2367
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
When we observe

2368
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
animals, it's boring.

2369
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
When mating,

2370
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
the third mate

2371
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
might react in a bad way.

2372
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It's boring.

2373
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But if you think about it,

2374
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
it's like a couple

2375
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
fighting in the park.

2376
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
They fought.

2377
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I told you to buy soy sauce,

2378
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
but you went out to date.

2379
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
When you use images,

2380
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
it becomes interesting.

2381
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Everyone can imagine it.

2382
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Everyone can understand

2383
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
what's going on.

2384
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
When you bring it up,

2385
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
you can talk about

2386
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
what we see in biology.

2387
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's interesting

2388
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
and you learn something.

2389
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's cool to share with others.

2390
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I think Xiao-jin is good

2391
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
at using metaphors.

2392
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I run

2393
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Sky's Instagram.

2394
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Many readers leave comments

2395
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
on Instagram.

2396
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
They say,

2397
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
they've never thought

2398
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
they'd understand biology

2399
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
or science.

2400
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But it's so funny.

2401
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
After laughing,

2402
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I realized I understood.

2403
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's touching.

2404
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
It's like

2405
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
a virtual science.

2406
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
It's like

2407
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
electrons,

2408
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
atoms,

2409
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and positrons.

2410
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
It's like chemistry.

2411
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It has to be perfect.

2412
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
When there's a free machine,

2413
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
it's like

2414
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
when there's only one electron,

2415
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
no one holds hands,

2416
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
it becomes a mountain.

2417
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It destroys

2418
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
your DNA.

2419
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It's a good example.

2420
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
A free machine is a mountain.

2421
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
A mountain will destroy a family.

2422
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
A free machine will destroy

2423
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
my body.

2424
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's similar to

2425
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
life.

2426
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It's far from the past.

2427
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
But it's a strong example.

2428
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I think many people

2429
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
can understand and catch up.

2430
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yes.

2431
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
This way

2432
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
can be trained

2433
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
in daily life.

2434
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yesterday,

2435
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
when we were in the LINE group,

2436
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
we attended

2437
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Tara's speech.

2438
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It was a long speech.

2439
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I replied right away.

2440
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Of course not.

2441
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Have you ever seen a steak

2442
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
only served with iron plate

2443
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and three-color beans

2444
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
without steak?

2445
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Iron plate noodles.

2446
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yes, iron plate noodles.

2447
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
There's no main dish.

2448
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
To be a staff member,

2449
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
you have to attend an academic speech.

2450
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I told her,

2451
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
we have a speech.

2452
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
There are some metaphors

2453
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
you can apply

2454
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and learn.

2455
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
You can apply it

2456
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
to your writing.

2457
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
First,

2458
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
visualize

2459
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
something interesting.

2460
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Strengthen it.

2461
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Then,

2462
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
connect your scientific knowledge.

2463
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
There are some connections.

2464
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
When the reader

2465
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
or audience

2466
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
receives a piece of information,

2467
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
they will connect it.

2468
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It's easy to

2469
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
form a memory.

2470
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
How to strengthen the memory

2471
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
is important.

2472
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
My teacher was good at this.

2473
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
She told me,

2474
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
choosing a boss is like choosing a husband.

2475
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
You have to be with him for years.

2476
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It sounds important.

2477
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
She explained to me

2478
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
P-Value.

2479
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
We all have a P-Value

2480
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
like a metaphor.

2481
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
But how much

2482
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
is the P-Value?

2483
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
If you ask her,

2484
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
she'll say,

2485
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
how much is the P-Value?

2486
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
P is 0.9.

2487
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It must be terrible.

2488
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
If she's good at speaking,

2489
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
she'll recommend it.

2490
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
If the noodle is good,

2491
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
you must try it.

2492
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
It must be good.

2493
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
It's different.

2494
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It's different from others.

2495
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
When she said it, I understood.

2496
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
It's not necessarily right.

2497
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
It's right if you follow her.

2498
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That's a great metaphor.

2499
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Everyone said

2500
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
a P-Value at the end.

2501
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You know it very well.

2502
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
You can remember it.

2503
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You can remember it.

2504
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Cool.

2505
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I want to read your article.

2506
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Do you post it on Facebook?

2507
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Or blog?

2508
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I'll put it on the wall

2509
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and post it

2510
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
on Facebook.

2511
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
What's it called?

2512
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
V-Side is

2513
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
the fan page of

2514
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Nervous Pig Tail.

2515
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
She left a message.

2516
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's Wen Qing Guan.

2517
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yes, it's Wen Qing Guan.

2518
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
V-Side is

2519
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
like Tang Feng.

2520
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Anyone can be called.

2521
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Tang Feng likes us.

2522
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Can you share

2523
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
where you

2524
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
share your articles?

2525
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Chen Zhen You.

2526
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I...

2527
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I share it

2528
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
on Facebook.

2529
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I post it

2530
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
on my fan page

2531
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and post it

2532
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
on Nervous Pig Tail

2533
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and

2534
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
V-Side.

2535
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Mainly these two.

2536
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Can you post your fan page?

2537
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Can I?

2538
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Sure.

2539
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
We're a

2540
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
promotion platform.

2541
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
If you want to promote something,

2542
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
you can post your link.

2543
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Tell us your name.

2544
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Let's make a circle.

2545
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
My brain has a mouth.

2546
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I think I've seen it.

2547
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Is it a mouth?

2548
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I thought it was a crime.

2549
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Is it Wen Qing?

2550
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
That's too Wen Qing.

2551
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
My brain is a original crime.

2552
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I have a like.

2553
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Cool.

2554
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
When the fans recognize you,

2555
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
they'll scream.

2556
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I want to ask

2557
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
a similar question.

2558
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Chen Zhen You asked

2559
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
how to

2560
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
attract readers

2561
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
in writing.

2562
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I want to ask

2563
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
how to

2564
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
attract readers

2565
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
in writing.

2566
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I want to share

2567
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
what you want to convey

2568
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
as a scientist.

2569
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
This is the problem

2570
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I'm facing.

2571
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
When I meet someone

2572
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
or want to flirt,

2573
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
you can say

2574
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I'm not good at it.

2575
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It's normal.

2576
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You can describe

2577
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
you're a physicist

2578
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
or a physicist.

2579
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm a laser scientist.

2580
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I study light.

2581
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
They'll say you're so smart.

2582
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Their mind

2583
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
will be strong.

2584
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Don't tell me

2585
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
your major.

2586
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You can feel

2587
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
the wall.

2588
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You can't communicate.

2589
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I want to know...

2590
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Is your brain like this?

2591
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
My wife is interested

2592
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
in my research.

2593
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Wait, you have a wife?

2594
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I want my wife

2595
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
to be interested.

2596
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
His wife is his wife.

2597
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I want to know

2598
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
if there's a way

2599
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
to successfully

2600
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
make

2601
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
the other person

2602
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
convey

2603
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
what we learned

2604
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
in science.

2605
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Is your goal

2606
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
to talk about science?

2607
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Or is your goal...

2608
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I think

2609
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
this is related

2610
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
to your audience.

2611
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You can ask

2612
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
other editors.

2613
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I think

2614
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
my goal is

2615
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
to convey

2616
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
what I learned

2617
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
to other people

2618
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
with the money

2619
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I got from

2620
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
the Nazis.

2621
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Tell your wife?

2622
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
At least my wife

2623
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
should know.

2624
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Or people

2625
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I meet.

2626
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I want to share

2627
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
something.

2628
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
My research

2629
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
focuses on the elderly.

2630
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
They have

2631
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
an impression

2632
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
that they're stubborn.

2633
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
We have a technique

2634
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
called

2635
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
motivation interviewing.

2636
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
You can't

2637
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
directly...

2638
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
If your audience

2639
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
doesn't want to hear you

2640
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
say something,

2641
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
don't say it

2642
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
directly.

2643
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
CS shared

2644
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
that you have to

2645
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
connect to your topic

2646
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
from their perspective.

2647
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
You have to be related

2648
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
to them

2649
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
before they're interested.

2650
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Otherwise,

2651
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it's irrelevant

2652
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
to them.

2653
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So,

2654
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
it depends on

2655
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
your language,

2656
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
your attitude,

2657
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
and your usage.

2658
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
If you're talking to your wife,

2659
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
you can

2660
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
act cute.

2661
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You can tell her

2662
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
that you want to share

2663
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
your research

2664
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
with her.

2665
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
You're the one

2666
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I want to share

2667
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
with her.

2668
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
If you're just a passer-by,

2669
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
you can

2670
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
ask her about her background

2671
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
first.

2672
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
What's the connection

2673
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
between your research and her background?

2674
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
You can discuss it.

2675
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Sometimes, you have to

2676
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
be interested in

2677
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
the other person.

2678
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You have to be interested

2679
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
in their background story

2680
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
so that the conversation

2681
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
can go on.

2682
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Do other editors

2683
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
have their own

2684
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
techniques or ideas?

2685
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Yes.

2686
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I think it's a good technique.

2687
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
You can

2688
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
ask the subject

2689
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
about the field

2690
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
they're interested in

2691
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
and see if there's

2692
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
a connection between

2693
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
their science.

2694
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
You can let them know

2695
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
what they're interested in.

2696
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
From a scientific point of view,

2697
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
they can learn

2698
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
about this field.

2699
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
For example, my partner

2700
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
likes Hermes a lot.

2701
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
She likes the bag.

2702
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Do you know the difference

2703
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
between Hermes' alligator

2704
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
and the crocodile?

2705
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
It's not the same.

2706
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
The animal patterns

2707
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
on the bag

2708
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
are determined

2709
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
by the genes.

2710
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
You can connect

2711
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
the fashion items

2712
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
she likes

2713
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
to the animal genes.

2714
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
She'll understand

2715
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
why there's a color

2716
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
or a pattern on the bag.

2717
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Or she'll understand

2718
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
the distribution of

2719
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
the animals' origins

2720
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
in different regions.

2721
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You can use it like this.

2722
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I think it sounds

2723
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
interesting.

2724
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'll give it a try.

2725
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Or you can

2726
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
use a popular

2727
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
catchphrase.

2728
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It's a scientific catchphrase.

2729
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Like,

2730
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm willing to

2731
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
treat you like a red blood cell.

2732
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Your love is my oxygen.

2733
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
For your love,

2734
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I don't even need my heart.

2735
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Red blood cells don't have cells.

2736
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It's the opposite.

2737
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You can tell her,

2738
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
honey,

2739
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
even if we're

2740
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
the same age...

2741
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Honey, I'll treat your love

2742
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
as if we're the same age.

2743
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
We'll never be apart.

2744
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
We're inseparable.

2745
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
She'll ask,

2746
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
don't you know?

2747
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
These two things

2748
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
are different, but we can't

2749
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
separate them.

2750
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
It's like us.

2751
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It's a scientific fact.

2752
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
But you link it

2753
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
to something interesting.

2754
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I think a lot of things in science

2755
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
are romantic.

2756
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Like receptors.

2757
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I can only connect to you.

2758
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I can't connect to anyone else.

2759
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I want the virus to

2760
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
take the AEC2

2761
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and connect to us.

2762
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It's painful to be

2763
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
connected to the virus.

2764
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It's like being killed.

2765
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
You said we can be separated.

2766
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Xiao Jing, you're being spied on.

2767
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
What?

2768
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
You're being spied on.

2769
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
It's okay.

2770
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
We don't need to get married

2771
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
to the virus.

2772
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Who was talking just now?

2773
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Dou Dou.

2774
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Dou Dou is our immune specialist.

2775
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So,

2776
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
if we talk about immune stuff today,

2777
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'll get infected.

2778
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I was going to say

2779
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
you were talking about being poisoned.

2780
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
It's not like you'll

2781
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
tell him you're poisoned.

2782
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It's just a possibility.

2783
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I'll be more aggressive.

2784
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
When he's in pain,

2785
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I'll say,

2786
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
you might not be poisoned,

2787
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
but it's a possibility.

2788
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Please call an ambulance for me.

2789
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I'm not trying to solve his problem.

2790
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm just being a scientist.

2791
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I agree.

2792
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
That's a good question.

2793
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I don't think I'll

2794
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
really talk to

2795
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
the general public

2796
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
or people who don't

2797
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
study science that much.

2798
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yeah.

2799
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I just heard

2800
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Shilan say

2801
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
you're doing research on physics.

2802
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
That's really...

2803
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Is that how you say it?

2804
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I think

2805
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
it's harder to...

2806
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
That's a weird way to say it.

2807
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
You're the one who thinks it's weird.

2808
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
People think

2809
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
what we do is deep.

2810
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
What we do is...

2811
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
It's just a lab.

2812
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's just

2813
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
putting together

2814
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
capacitors and capacitors.

2815
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You're a welder

2816
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
and a water pipe connector.

2817
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
You connect all kinds of things.

2818
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
That's all you do every day.

2819
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
It's not as complicated

2820
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
as people think.

2821
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I think it's complicated.

2822
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I think it's complicated, too.

2823
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Yeah.

2824
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I think it's because your field

2825
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
sounds complicated.

2826
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
You have to start with

2827
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
simple things.

2828
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
For example,

2829
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
when I talk to people,

2830
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm afraid to answer

2831
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
when people ask me about my background.

2832
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
When I first came to Italy,

2833
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I wanted to make friends,

2834
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
so I talked to people about

2835
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
my background,

2836
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
and they were like,

2837
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
oh, I see.

2838
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
That's usually the case.

2839
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
That's usually the case.

2840
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
When you're at a friend's party,

2841
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
people ask you,

2842
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
what do you do?

2843
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
You answer, I do physics.

2844
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Then people start to change the subject.

2845
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So you have to be prepared.

2846
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Like the welder

2847
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
you mentioned earlier.

2848
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
He's a good guy.

2849
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It's not that it's difficult

2850
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
when you hear physics,

2851
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
but we're like welders.

2852
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
We're all welding.

2853
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'll answer,

2854
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
it's not that it's difficult,

2855
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
but I use my computer to analyze.

2856
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I'm just a nerd.

2857
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm a nerd.

2858
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I'm a nerd.

2859
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I'm a nerd.

2860
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I'm a nerd.

2861
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I'm a nerd.

2862
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I'm a nerd.

2863
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
This know-how,

2864
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
do you have any questions?

2865
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
You're welcome.

2866
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You can ask all kinds of questions.

2867
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Yeah, because podcast

2868
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
is about all kinds of things.

2869
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It's not like we'll answer

2870
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
all the right questions.

2871
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
If you listen to our podcast,

2872
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
you'll know that every time something comes up,

2873
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
we all have different opinions.

2874
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It's a discussion.

2875
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Wang Yiting.

2876
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I don't know how to pronounce it.

2877
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Hi, I'm Yiting.

2878
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm a part of today's speaker.

2879
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I'm happy to be here

2880
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
to teach everyone.

2881
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Is it Yiting?

2882
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Yes, that's me.

2883
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Yiting I met at a science activity.

2884
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Yes, that's me.

2885
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I'm just curious

2886
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
that I've been

2887
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
listening to everyone

2888
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
from the perspective of a spectator

2889
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
and thought that

2890
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
everyone's background is more

2891
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
in the field of natural science.

2892
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
As far as I know,

2893
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
my field was

2894
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
traditional natural science

2895
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
in medical school.

2896
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Then I slowly

2897
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
got closer to social science.

2898
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
For example, social science

2899
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
or some other

2900
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
philosophical people

2901
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
might have a chance to collaborate.

2902
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Of course, I can't claim

2903
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
that I'm the only one.

2904
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
From the perspective of social science,

2905
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
they often do

2906
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
so-called knowledge promotion.

2907
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
In fact,

2908
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
there are a lot of

2909
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
social science-related things on the market.

2910
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
For example, legal white paper.

2911
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Because everyone feels

2912
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
that when we hear about

2913
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
the problems of natural science,

2914
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
for example,

2915
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
everyone is quiet.

2916
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
But in fact,

2917
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
they also have similar problems.

2918
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Oh, I study social science,

2919
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and everyone is quiet.

2920
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
In fact, I have seen

2921
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
a lot of fans

2922
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
who want to do

2923
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
knowledge promotion

2924
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
of social science.

2925
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I want to explain

2926
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
some more complicated concepts to you.

2927
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I don't know if you

2928
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
have any experience

2929
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
in this knowledge promotion

2930
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
or so-called science promotion

2931
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
that other partners have discussed.

2932
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
In fact, what we want to do is similar,

2933
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
but our subjects are different.

2934
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm just curious about your experience.

2935
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
From their perspective,

2936
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
how does it work?

2937
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Or when you were running

2938
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
a fan page,

2939
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
did you see other examples

2940
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
that they did well?

2941
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I want to take this opportunity

2942
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
to learn more.

2943
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Maybe I haven't revealed it yet,

2944
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
but I want to share it with you.

2945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Do you mean

2946
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
social science?

2947
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Social science,

2948
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
for example,

2949
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
psychology.

2950
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Psychology is actually quite common,

2951
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and I often write articles about it.

2952
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Maybe economics,

2953
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
society, management,

2954
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
law, and politics

2955
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
are all social science.

2956
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
In fact,

2957
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
they also have some

2958
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
demands

2959
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
that they want to share with the public

2960
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
to let people know that

2961
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
what we do professionally

2962
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
is not just in our own ivory tower,

2963
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
but also wants to connect

2964
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
with everyone's daily life.

2965
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I think they may also be looking for

2966
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
a place for them to cut in.

2967
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
As you said,

2968
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I can't think of

2969
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
anything other than

2970
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
legal dialogues.

2971
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
But I know

2972
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
there's a lot of

2973
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
cultural knowledge

2974
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
in the show.

2975
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
For example,

2976
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
linguistics.

2977
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I'm actually

2978
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
inviting a linguist

2979
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
to be the host of

2980
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Knowledge is Fun.

2981
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I hope he'll accept our interview.

2982
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Knowledge is Fun is a podcast

2983
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
about culture and listening.

2984
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
They also

2985
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
worked with

2986
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
the New York Times.

2987
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
It's more natural science.

2988
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
They have a series of

2989
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Knowledge is Fun,

2990
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
including linguistics,

2991
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
criminal psychology,

2992
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and so on.

2993
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Philosophy is also fun.

2994
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
They also do some sharing.

2995
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
What was the name

2996
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
of the show before?

2997
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Philosophy, Philosophy, Egg Cake.

2998
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
They do

2999
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
a lot of philosophy.

3000
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I don't know much

3001
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
about sociology.

3002
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
But Lawyer Lv is good.

3003
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
He talks a lot

3004
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
about everything.

3005
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Do you have

3006
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
any comments

3007
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
or thoughts

3008
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
you'd like to share?

3009
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I like the story.

3010
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I think it's

3011
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
about history.

3012
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yes.

3013
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It's so good.

3014
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
You can see it on iQIYI.

3015
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I'm still watching

3016
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
on Instagram.

3017
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Unless I'm really interested,

3018
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I'll look at the text.

3019
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
But I think they're good.

3020
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
They write about history.

3021
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It's a story.

3022
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
It's interesting.

3023
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
When I was in high school,

3024
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I don't know if you've seen

3025
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
what history textbooks

3026
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I wrote in high school.

3027
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Why did I write

3028
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
literary textbooks in high school?

3029
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And all of my answers

3030
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
were wrong.

3031
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
You're revealing your age.

3032
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I'm revealing my age.

3033
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
The most painful thing

3034
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
was that I thought literary textbooks

3035
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
had a lot of room to explain.

3036
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
It's just two or three words.

3037
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I thought maybe that's what they meant.

3038
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I was like, why would you think that?

3039
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Of course, I didn't have time

3040
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
to discuss this with you in class.

3041
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
But I think that's the way

3042
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
you should learn history.

3043
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
History is what people do.

3044
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
A person may have a lot of reasons

3045
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
to do this.

3046
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Why must it be like this?

3047
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Today, he wrote a non-human disaster.

3048
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Was he happy to write a non-human disaster?

3049
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Did he write a non-human disaster?

3050
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Or did he think he looked ugly?

3051
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Or did he think

3052
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
it was too much to

3053
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
deal with?

3054
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
You don't know.

3055
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Why do you only have one answer?

3056
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Do you have any

3057
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
suggestions?

3058
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Are you doing

3059
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
research on this?

3060
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Do you have any suggestions

3061
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
for us?

3062
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Because I also

3063
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
had more opportunities to

3064
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
get in touch with philosophy on Friday.

3065
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I used to have

3066
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
very unfamiliar discussions.

3067
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
When I started participating,

3068
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I thought that

3069
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
if the mainstream background

3070
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
was more

3071
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
natural science,

3072
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
people would have a way of discussing

3073
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and speaking.

3074
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
But in the mainstream of

3075
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
social science,

3076
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
they would also have a way of speaking.

3077
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
When I first participated,

3078
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I thought it was a new experience.

3079
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
But after a few times,

3080
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I realized that

3081
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
many things are the same.

3082
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's just that

3083
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
how do we make

3084
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
what we think is important

3085
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
but may be complicated

3086
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
more interesting to more people?

3087
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I don't have many

3088
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
suggestions.

3089
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I just think that

3090
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
the experience of

3091
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
exposing each other

3092
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
is helpful to me.

3093
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I may see more opportunities

3094
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
to get closer to each other.

3095
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
So I'm just curious

3096
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
if this is a future direction

3097
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
of Sky in the World.

3098
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
As you just heard,

3099
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
we are now in the industry

3100
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
where people call each other

3101
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
the wall side.

3102
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Through this way of

3103
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
increasing contact,

3104
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I think it can really help us

3105
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
to understand more.

3106
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
In addition to wanting to

3107
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
let others understand our knowledge,

3108
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I think the experience

3109
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
of teaching each other

3110
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
is quite useful to me.

3111
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So I'm just curious

3112
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
if this is also a future direction

3113
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that everyone is interested in.

3114
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
It sounds like there is.

3115
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I just want to share this.

3116
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
This is not the future,

3117
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
this is the progress.

3118
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
In our interview,

3119
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
we will invite people from

3120
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
different fields.

3121
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Of course,

3122
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
we will invite people

3123
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
from different fields.

3124
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
For example,

3125
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
we have interviewed

3126
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
people from education,

3127
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
such as Annie,

3128
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
who was our guest speaker

3129
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
last time,

3130
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
and Dr. Yi Yang,

3131
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
who is a professor of music.

3132
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
He is teaching music history

3133
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
in the US.

3134
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
We will also invite people

3135
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
from language studies,

3136
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
or even people

3137
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
who are not in the scientific field.

3138
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
We have also interviewed

3139
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
people like Maria,

3140
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
who is a Chinese bride.

3141
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
We have always been

3142
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
trying to get in touch

3143
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
with people from different fields.

3144
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
But this is not

3145
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
a scientific conversation.

3146
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Our research field

3147
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
is very different,

3148
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
but we all have to live.

3149
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
So I will put this

3150
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
topic in the interview,

3151
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
because the interview

3152
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
may be a topic

3153
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
on how to plan

3154
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
your life.

3155
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
So when different

3156
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
life plans

3157
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
are shared by people

3158
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
from different fields,

3159
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
there will be different sparks.

3160
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Because we all have to live,

3161
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
but we don't have to be

3162
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
scientific.

3163
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So we use this sense of community

3164
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
in our interviews.

3165
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I hope I have answered your question.

3166
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
You mentioned that

3167
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
if you want to join

3168
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
the self-media

3169
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
or spread the message,

3170
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
the threshold is very low.

3171
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
For example,

3172
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
if we want to do a podcast,

3173
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
we only need a computer

3174
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
and a cell phone.

3175
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
So we don't need

3176
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
any equipment

3177
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
The only difficulty

3178
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
is the adjustment

3179
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
in time.

3180
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
That's because our team is big.

3181
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Sorry, our team is a bit big.

3182
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
We need to adjust.

3183
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
But if

3184
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
we are a single person,

3185
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
we have heard

3186
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
that the podcast is a single person.

3187
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So if you are a person

3188
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
and I want to share something with everyone,

3189
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
you can.

3190
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I just thought that

3191
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
if you are a college student

3192
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
in the architecture department,

3193
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
they also have their own podcast.

3194
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I forgot the name.

3195
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
If you want to know,

3196
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
you can find out.

3197
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I just want to say

3198
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
hi to everyone.

3199
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
You can communicate with Alan.

3200
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
We are good friends.

3201
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
We have a LINE group.

3202
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
We talk every day.

3203
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
We talk a lot every day.

3204
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I think

3205
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
this is a very good direction.

3206
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Because we really

3207
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
lack

3208
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
certain types of scholars.

3209
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
We lack a lot.

3210
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
The physicist, please

3211
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
agree to our interview.

3212
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Otherwise, we won't let you off the hook.

3213
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
This is his.

3214
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Sorry.

3215
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You should

3216
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
invite him to

3217
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
an interview.

3218
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Let's help him discuss

3219
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
how to chat with his wife.

3220
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
After the interview,

3221
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
we will let his wife listen to it.

3222
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
It's very interesting.

3223
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It's very interesting.

3224
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But our audience

3225
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
has a question.

3226
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Let's let the audience ask first.

3227
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I want to ask

3228
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
have you ever thought

3229
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
to promote your podcast

3230
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
to high school or even high school?

3231
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Because you have a lot of skills.

3232
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Like protein

3233
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
or bacteria.

3234
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Those skills

3235
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
made me think

3236
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
this is my high school knowledge.

3237
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
If the school taught like this at that time,

3238
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
it might

3239
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
be more interesting.

3240
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I think

3241
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
this channel is really interesting.

3242
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
If I have a chance to promote

3243
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
to national high school,

3244
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
it might be very interesting.

3245
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Thank you.

3246
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
That's a very good suggestion.

3247
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
But we can't

3248
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
control the audience's level.

3249
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
But

3250
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I have tried my best

3251
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
to find teachers

3252
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
to interview.

3253
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I hope to attract

3254
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
their approval.

3255
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Maybe it can be spread.

3256
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But

3257
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
teaching at national high school

3258
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
really needs to teach

3259
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
the principles

3260
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
or rules.

3261
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Because

3262
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
we talk about

3263
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
academic articles in the program.

3264
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
So it might be

3265
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
something that hasn't been decided yet.

3266
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
It's possible.

3267
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
So

3268
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I don't know

3269
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
if I can understand

3270
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
this program

3271
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
without a solid basic knowledge.

3272
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I'm afraid that

3273
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
they will fight with the teacher

3274
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
after the Sky in the World interview.

3275
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Isn't it good?

3276
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Our education needs this kind of spark.

3277
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I think this is to convey to them

3278
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
that something is not only the right answer.

3279
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Aren't these people doctors?

3280
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I think high school should

3281
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
have a chance.

3282
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Because

3283
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
the basic knowledge

3284
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
like sugar,

3285
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
or protein,

3286
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
or fat,

3287
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I think they should

3288
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
have a chance

3289
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
to interact with the textbook.

3290
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I hope

3291
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
high school students can come.

3292
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Our

3293
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Clubhouse

3294
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
has a

3295
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
host

3296
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
twice in a row.

3297
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's a textbook on Instagram.

3298
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It's three times in a row.

3299
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
So

3300
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
we hope to

3301
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
get to know these people.

3302
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
OK.

3303
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Thank you.

3304
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It's my first time to see you.

3305
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's my first time to see you.

3306
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It's my first time to see you.

3307
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
It's my first time to see you.

3308
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
You look like

3309
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
a grandpa.

3310
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
My white beard.

3311
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
My white beard.

3312
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Do I look like a grandpa?

3313
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Do I look like a grandpa?

3314
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Yes, your glasses.

3315
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
You look like a natural

3316
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
grandpa.

3317
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Mom's dad.

3318
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Adam, do you want to take off your shirt?

3319
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Or he can't recognize you.

3320
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I can recognize you.

3321
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
On Instagram,

3322
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I saw Adam

3323
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
showing off his muscles.

3324
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
It's different from now.

3325
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
It's different from now.

3326
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Too many people. I'm not shy.

3327
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
OK.

3328
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Sorry to interrupt.

3329
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I want to

3330
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
comment from Taira's perspective.

3331
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
You mentioned

3332
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
many platforms.

3333
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I don't know

3334
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
about them.

3335
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I've never seen or heard of them.

3336
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I want to say

3337
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
from Taira's perspective,

3338
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
we might want to

3339
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
collaborate with these organizations.

3340
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
We can try.

3341
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I don't know

3342
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
if we should

3343
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
organize

3344
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
a group

3345
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
to talk about

3346
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
science or

3347
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
knowledge.

3348
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
We can

3349
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
write down

3350
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
the links

3351
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
and see

3352
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
who we can collaborate with.

3353
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
The second comment

3354
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
is

3355
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
from Taira's perspective.

3356
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
We have many PhD students.

3357
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
They have

3358
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
very professional

3359
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
background knowledge.

3360
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I think

3361
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
we should

3362
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
collaborate with them.

3363
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
We can find people

3364
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
to interview.

3365
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I think

3366
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
you can see

3367
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
that Taira's team

3368
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
focuses on natural science.

3369
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
But there are

3370
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
many branches in natural science.

3371
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
And

3372
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
there are many

3373
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
areas I've never heard of

3374
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
before.

3375
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
So I think

3376
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
you can dig

3377
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
and protect them.

3378
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
You can dig for resources.

3379
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I just want to say that.

3380
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
How can we find

3381
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Taira's

3382
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
contacts?

3383
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Are you the window?

3384
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I want to find

3385
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Taira's contacts.

3386
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Taira has a PR team.

3387
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I think our seminar team is too busy.

3388
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
We have a PR team.

3389
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Xinda has a PR team.

3390
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
You are familiar with it.

3391
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Yes.

3392
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I used to be in the PR team.

3393
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Then I

3394
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
became

3395
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
the president.

3396
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
That's it.

3397
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
You can

3398
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
contact us.

3399
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Maybe we can

3400
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
work together.

3401
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I think it's interesting.

3402
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I have an idea.

3403
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I just thought of it.

3404
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I don't have to agree with you.

3405
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Sleep on it.

3406
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Taiwan

3407
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
has interviewed

3408
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Shanae.

3409
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
She is the PI

3410
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
for Taiwan.

3411
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
They are

3412
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
doing the same thing

3413
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
as us.

3414
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
They are also working on

3415
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
scientific communication.

3416
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
They are from the UK.

3417
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
They are distributed in 5 or 6 different countries.
