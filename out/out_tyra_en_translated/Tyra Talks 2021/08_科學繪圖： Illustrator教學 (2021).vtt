00:00.000 --> 00:19.460
Hello everyone, welcome to today's lecture on July 31st, Project HIRA. Today is a special event in the summer, and we would like to invite Professor Tu-Ming Feng, who is now at the University of Westlake.

00:19.460 --> 00:34.460
His main research focuses on the theory of quantum physics. He is interested in low-dimensional materials, transport phenomena, and the topological phase of matter.

00:34.460 --> 00:48.460
Although he is a theorist, he also likes to cooperate with experimentalists to realize his theories.

00:48.460 --> 01:05.460
Another important thing is that he is also very interested in scientific education, so he hopes that today's lecture can bring us some gains.

01:05.460 --> 01:11.460
Today's lecture is mainly about the teaching of the scientific diagram and Illustrator.

01:11.460 --> 01:23.460
I hope that in this lecture, we can learn the importance of the scientific diagram, the thinking process, and how to use Illustrator.

01:23.460 --> 01:29.460
Let's give Professor Tu-Ming Feng the floor.

01:29.460 --> 01:43.460
Hello everyone, this is my first time to give a lecture on Project HIRA, so please bear with me if there are any lags.

01:44.460 --> 01:54.460
Today, I will talk about the scientific diagram and how to use Illustrator to realize the scientific diagram.

01:54.460 --> 02:11.460
The scientific diagram is a very big topic, so I will talk about it in detail, but I will try to make it easy for you to understand.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.460
Illustrator is a bigger topic.

02:14.460 --> 02:24.460
At that time, I studied Illustrator for about two months, and I studied two nights a week and three hours a night.

02:24.460 --> 02:33.460
At that time, I studied Illustrator in a classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional class for advertising students.

02:34.460 --> 02:42.460
At that time, I studied Illustrator in a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University.

02:42.460 --> 02:46.460
Basically, you take a picture and use Illustrator to copy it completely.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.460
So we do this kind of practice every week.

02:49.460 --> 02:53.460
We will practice from a small lamp to an apple.

02:53.460 --> 02:59.460
But when I was studying for my Ph.D., I had to draw a lot of pictures.

02:59.460 --> 03:11.460
Especially when I did a lot of scientific education, I had to talk to the general public about some difficult quantum problems or some difficult physics problems.

03:11.460 --> 03:16.460
At this time, you have to draw a good picture to help them.

03:16.460 --> 03:22.460
But this kind of picture only needs some basic functions of Illustrator.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.460
You don't need advanced functions.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.460
So today I will introduce these basic functions and help you get started.

03:28.460 --> 03:31.460
At the end, I will give you some videos.

03:31.460 --> 03:39.460
If you practice according to these videos, you will probably understand how to use Illustrator by drawing five to ten pictures.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.460
Then you can move on from there.

03:43.460 --> 03:49.460
If you have any questions later, you can leave a message in the chat.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.460
So this is my routine today.

03:55.460 --> 04:00.460
I want to tell you first that the science team is very subjective.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.460
Some people think this picture is beautiful, some people think that picture is beautiful.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.460
What I'm talking about today is mainly my subjective opinion and experience.

04:07.460 --> 04:17.460
It's also my experience of helping people change articles for so many years.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.460
So if you have a different idea, you are welcome to leave it in the comments.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.460
I'm sure a lot of people have the same opinion as you.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.460
Okay, the concept of scientific drawing.

04:29.460 --> 04:33.460
When we start talking about the concept of scientific drawing, I need you to start imagining.

04:33.460 --> 04:39.460
How do you draw a picture based on your recent article or article you just wrote?

04:42.460 --> 04:47.460
Usually, as a scientist, you start with a PhD.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.460
First, you will do a lot of research.

04:49.460 --> 04:53.460
After the research, you may write a paper.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.460
After writing the paper, you have to give a speech everywhere.

04:56.460 --> 05:02.460
So when you want to present to others, you mainly write articles and give speeches.

05:02.460 --> 05:05.460
The purpose of these two parts is also very different.

05:05.460 --> 05:11.460
But whether it's an article or a speech, it basically has some components.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.460
That is, there are words, pictures, and charts.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.460
But every article has words, pictures, and charts.

05:22.460 --> 05:25.460
But what kind of scientific article do you think is good to read?

05:25.460 --> 05:29.460
I believe when you read other people's literature, you read other people's papers.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.460
So sometimes you think, why is this article so difficult to read?

05:31.460 --> 05:34.460
Why did I read this paragraph 10 times and still not understand it?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.460
Or why when I went to listen to the slideshow,

05:36.460 --> 05:42.460
there were people who did experiments for 20 minutes and showed you 100 slides.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.460
Then you don't understand what the slides are talking about.

05:45.460 --> 05:49.460
So sometimes you think a certain article is particularly difficult to read, particularly difficult to understand.

05:49.460 --> 05:54.460
Or some slideshows, some presentations, you may fall asleep after 10 minutes.

05:54.460 --> 05:59.460
This kind of thing means that this article or this is not necessarily your problem.

05:59.460 --> 06:03.460
But a lot of times, this presenter or this author,

06:03.460 --> 06:07.460
his article or his slideshow is a bit problematic.

06:07.460 --> 06:11.460
So his slideshow or this article is not so easy to read.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.460
So what is a good scientific article?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.460
There are basically four concepts.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.460
I'll give you a lot of examples of these four concepts later.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.460
Let you understand what these four concepts mean.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.460
Because I've been talking about this for a long time.

06:26.460 --> 06:30.460
Okay, first of all, this article has to be very clear.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.460
You're writing a scientific article.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.460
What is my experiment?

06:35.460 --> 06:36.460
What is my method?

06:36.460 --> 06:38.460
And how did I do it?

06:38.460 --> 06:39.460
What is my final result?

06:39.460 --> 06:41.460
What does this result mean?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.460
And what does that mean?

06:43.460 --> 06:45.460
And how do I get from this meaning?

06:45.460 --> 06:47.460
Go down and do more discussion.

06:47.460 --> 06:50.460
It should be a very clear, very clear thing.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.460
What about your English sentence?

06:52.460 --> 06:54.460
We usually hope it's a simple sentence.

06:54.460 --> 06:57.460
You don't want to use too many complicated sentences.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.460
And then there's a lot, a lot of words.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.460
That's not good.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.460
The simplest thing is that you have to be very clear.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.460
Write down the whole story of the fact you're doing research.

07:07.460 --> 07:08.460
What about this story?

07:08.460 --> 07:10.460
In addition to writing it down very clearly,

07:10.460 --> 07:15.460
You have to have a very, very strict logic between each component.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.460
That's why this one is going to take this paragraph.

07:17.460 --> 07:21.460
There should be a reason for this.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.460
So when you write an article,

07:24.460 --> 07:27.460
It's not going to make people think, oh, I said A, and then I said B.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.460
But there's a jump between A and B.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.460
I don't know why I'm talking about B.

07:30.460 --> 07:31.460
I don't know what A is.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.460
Transition to B.

07:32.460 --> 07:33.460
I'll just say A and B.

07:33.460 --> 07:34.460
That's not good.

07:34.460 --> 07:38.460
This is what you see a lot in a lot of presentations.

07:38.460 --> 07:41.460
The third one is precise.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.460
What kind of experiment are you telling people?

07:44.460 --> 07:47.460
If it's a paper, if it's a presentation,

07:47.460 --> 07:49.460
You can talk very long and wait for people to ask questions.

07:49.460 --> 07:52.460
But if you're a paper, you have to make it very clear.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.460
For example, what are some of your control variables?

07:55.460 --> 07:57.460
What temperature are you doing?

07:57.460 --> 08:00.460
You just have to find a corner in the paper.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.460
It's all about the narrative.

08:02.460 --> 08:03.460
It's all very precise.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.460
What about your inference?

08:05.460 --> 08:08.460
You have to be very, very precise with your words, especially your verbs.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.460
For example, this thing is what I guess.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.460
Or is this thing going to be like this?

08:13.460 --> 08:16.460
Is this cause and effect relationship very absolute?

08:16.460 --> 08:19.460
Or is it 80%?

08:19.460 --> 08:21.460
Is it possible to have a relationship?

08:21.460 --> 08:22.460
Maybe it doesn't matter.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.460
Or is this completely my guess?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.460
This kind of verb theory,

08:26.460 --> 08:29.460
You have to be very precise with your words.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.460
Okay, and then the fourth one.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.460
The important thing is that this article is easy to read.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.460
You can write it very clearly, very precise.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.460
But sometimes it's just not that easy to read.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.460
Or people don't want to read the first time they see it.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.460
For example, some articles are very well written,

08:45.460 --> 08:47.460
Then people don't want to read it.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.460
So you still have to readability.

08:51.460 --> 08:56.460
The first three are basically the skills you have to tell the story.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.460
This is another topic.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.460
What about the picture?

09:01.460 --> 09:04.460
The main thing is to strengthen the readability.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.460
It's beautiful and easy to read.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.460
This is the biggest use of the picture.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.460
So every time you draw a picture,

09:09.460 --> 09:13.460
This picture must add points to your article.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.460
The bonus part is that it makes people feel attractive and want to read it.

09:16.460 --> 09:19.460
Then you can use very clear materials.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.460
What are you studying?

09:26.460 --> 09:28.460
So let's take a look.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.460
A good scientific article or video.

09:30.460 --> 09:35.460
What kind of pictures do you think will be helpful to the audience?

09:35.460 --> 09:45.460
Then I'll try it.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.460
You can all use the speech function, right?

09:48.460 --> 09:51.460
I want you to give me some examples.

09:51.460 --> 09:59.460
What kind of pictures do you choose to put on your paper?

09:59.460 --> 10:02.460
Any ideas?

10:02.460 --> 10:05.460
Let's ask for three volunteers.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.460
Let's check if everyone is listening.

10:14.460 --> 10:19.460
Do you want to talk about it first?

10:19.460 --> 10:21.460
Me?

10:21.460 --> 10:27.460
I think it's important to have a process.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.460
There's a process, right?

10:30.460 --> 10:32.460
Or push down the process.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.460
Like a process diagram.

10:41.460 --> 10:47.460
I think my first picture will be

10:47.460 --> 10:49.460
In my experiment,

10:49.460 --> 10:53.460
It's a more innovative part.

10:53.460 --> 10:58.460
It's a more innovative part.

10:58.460 --> 11:00.460
Enlarge it and put it there.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.460
Then the second one is the entire experimental framework.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.460
It's innovative, right?

11:07.460 --> 11:10.460
And then put an experimental framework or process diagram.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.460
And then the last one is the data.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.460
The last one is the data.

11:14.460 --> 11:19.460
Anyone else want to add?

11:19.460 --> 11:21.460
We already have three.

11:24.460 --> 11:25.460
Okay.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.460
Today we're talking about these three pictures, right?

11:28.460 --> 11:31.460
I'm going to talk about exactly these three pictures today.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.460
It's a process diagram.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.460
Because we just talked about simple and easy to understand.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.460
Or beautiful and easy to understand.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.460
What is readability?

11:40.460 --> 11:42.460
Readability is that you want people to want to read.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.460
So we're going to have an innovative picture.

11:45.460 --> 11:49.460
What's the most innovative and different idea in your experiment?

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
This picture is usually very beautiful.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.460
And then put it on the first page.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.460
Because if you make this picture beautiful and put it on the first page,

11:54.460 --> 11:56.460
It's easy to be selected as the cover of the magazine.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.460
Okay.

11:57.460 --> 12:01.460
So this innovative picture is not the same as your other data pictures.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.460
I'll show you later.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.460
What is an innovative picture?

12:03.460 --> 12:05.460
And then the second one is.

12:05.460 --> 12:11.460
Almost doing experiments or doing a lot of social studies.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.460
Or the theory will have a process diagram.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.460
How do you do this experiment?

12:15.460 --> 12:17.460
How is your instrument exactly layered?

12:17.460 --> 12:19.460
So this is how we have a process diagram.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.460
The process diagram will make it easy for people to understand.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.460
Because if you want to describe your instrument,

12:25.460 --> 12:27.460
But if you use all the text, you'll say,

12:27.460 --> 12:31.460
Okay, I'm going to put A material on top of this material.

12:31.460 --> 12:36.460
C material, B material, C material, 9 cm, D material, 10 cm.

12:36.460 --> 12:40.460
If you're using text, you might have to be naked.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
I just said that for a whole page.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.460
You can't describe an instrument well.

12:44.460 --> 12:47.460
But you just need to put a little picture.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.460
He can put everything you just said on top of it.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.460
This is the most powerful part of the picture.

12:52.460 --> 12:56.460
So you think if you talk about a page of things, you can use a picture to replace it.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.460
You have to change that picture.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.460
Even if there's no data in that picture.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.460
But he can replace so many words.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.460
It's worth being put on.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
So this is the process diagram.

13:05.460 --> 13:06.460
Okay.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.460
But if you can finish your process in one sentence,

13:08.460 --> 13:10.460
You don't need to put this picture on.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.460
Because it's a waste of space.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.460
And then the last one is the data picture.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.460
You may have been doing experiments for several years.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.460
The most important thing is the data, right?

13:18.460 --> 13:20.460
So we're going to put the data picture in there, too.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.460
So the data picture should be more straightforward.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.460
Okay, so we're going to talk about these three.

13:31.460 --> 13:35.460
So let's take a look at the scientific picture.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.460
Of course, I can tell you what kind of picture it is.

13:37.460 --> 13:40.460
Basically, it's a good picture.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.460
So what kind of picture is a good picture?

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
What kind of picture is a bad picture?

13:45.460 --> 13:49.460
Let's take a look at it first.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.460
What do you think of this picture?

13:54.460 --> 13:58.460
Let's say this is the current situation of Kobe.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.460
And then some people are not infected.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.460
There are so many people who are not infected.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.460
And then some people are infected with no symptoms.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.460
Some people are infected with symptoms.

14:06.460 --> 14:08.460
Let's criticize this picture.

14:08.460 --> 14:12.460
From the criticism, you can slowly increase your beauty.

14:12.460 --> 14:17.460
What do you think is the biggest problem with this picture?

14:19.460 --> 14:21.460
There are too few people who are infected.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.460
There are too few people who are infected with symptoms.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.460
You can't see it on the picture.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.460
Yeah, you can barely see this, right?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.460
So you can barely see this picture.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.460
What's the purpose of this picture?

14:33.460 --> 14:35.460
I want people to compare and see how much this is.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.460
But this is so little.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.460
This original picture is a failure.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.460
You just can't see it.

14:41.460 --> 14:44.460
Let me talk about some suggestions in the chat.

14:44.460 --> 14:47.460
He said there is no main title.

14:47.460 --> 14:51.460
Does that mean there is no title?

14:51.460 --> 14:53.460
No title.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.460
And Ray said there is no value.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.460
No value, that's right.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.460
And Chi-Chi said...

15:01.460 --> 15:03.460
I'm sorry.

15:03.460 --> 15:05.460
It's ugly. Why do you want an original picture?

15:05.460 --> 15:07.460
You can just use this one.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.460
Okay.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.460
So everyone can see the point, right?

15:16.460 --> 15:18.460
This picture doesn't have any bonus points.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.460
This picture only contains three pieces of information.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.460
Basically, I don't know how many people are infected.

15:24.460 --> 15:27.460
And we don't know their numbers.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.460
So basically, this picture tells us only one piece of information.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.460
There are a lot of people who are not infected.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.460
That's it.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.460
And the sentence I just said can literally be used in one sentence.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.460
One sentence is the end.

15:38.460 --> 15:42.460
Why do I have to spend so much time to say one sentence to end it?

15:42.460 --> 15:44.460
So it's not necessary.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.460
This picture can be removed.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.460
I can just write one sentence.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.460
80% of people are not infected.

15:50.460 --> 15:54.460
15% of people are not infected.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.460
I can just finish this sentence.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.460
So the biggest problem with this picture is that

15:58.460 --> 16:02.460
in addition to not precise and no bonus points,

16:02.460 --> 16:04.460
it shouldn't exist at all.

16:04.460 --> 16:07.460
This is a picture I made up.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.460
But the biggest problem with this picture is that

16:09.460 --> 16:11.460
it shouldn't exist at all.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.460
It doesn't make sense at all.

16:13.460 --> 16:14.460
OK.

16:14.460 --> 16:17.460
So everyone actually has some aesthetics.

16:17.460 --> 16:20.460
Let's take a look at this picture.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.460
What do you think is wrong with this picture?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.460
You can also write it in the chat.

16:37.460 --> 16:38.460
OK.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.460
William said the font is too small.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.460
The font is too small.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.460
That's right.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.460
Usually, very experienced scientists

16:46.460 --> 16:48.460
will know the font size

16:48.460 --> 16:51.460
as soon as they see the article.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.460
Then they will know that the font is too small.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.460
It doesn't mark what each line is.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.460
What is the line of different shapes?

17:01.460 --> 17:02.460
What is it?

17:02.460 --> 17:03.460
That's right.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.460
It doesn't have a legend at all, does it?

17:05.460 --> 17:06.460
That's right.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.460
OK.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.460
Did you find that the picture below looks empty?

17:12.460 --> 17:14.460
But there is actually data below.

17:14.460 --> 17:16.460
This data is just very close to zero.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.460
Oh.

17:18.460 --> 17:19.460
Did you find that?

17:22.460 --> 17:23.460
Yes, like this picture,

17:23.460 --> 17:24.460
you either make it log,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.460
that is, semi-log 2,

17:26.460 --> 17:29.460
or you have to zoom out as much as possible.

17:29.460 --> 17:30.460
If it's all zero,

17:30.460 --> 17:31.460
you don't have to draw at all.

17:31.460 --> 17:32.460
Just write it all as zero.

17:32.460 --> 17:33.460
That's it.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.460
Yes, everyone has started to catch a point.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.460
Of course, we will...

17:39.460 --> 17:41.460
I usually...

17:41.460 --> 17:42.460
You'll know later.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.460
I'll tell you more in detail later.

17:44.460 --> 17:48.460
For example, this triangle is too small.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.460
It's too small compared to this one.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.460
And then this title.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.460
This is the X, Y axis.

17:55.460 --> 17:58.460
We usually use text.

17:58.460 --> 18:02.460
Try to avoid using delta P or T.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
Try not to use symbols.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.460
Try to use good things.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.460
OK.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.460
This picture...

18:09.460 --> 18:10.460
Every picture I'm showing now

18:10.460 --> 18:12.460
can be found on paper.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.460
These are all already published papers.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.460
This is also a paper that has already been published.

18:18.460 --> 18:22.460
What do you think of this picture?

18:27.460 --> 18:29.460
Is it not necessary to be three-dimensional?

18:29.460 --> 18:32.460
Does it want to be three-dimensional?

18:33.460 --> 18:34.460
That's right.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.460
Once upon a time,

18:36.460 --> 18:38.460
when people just started to draw three-dimensional pictures,

18:38.460 --> 18:39.460
they thought it was cool.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
So they wanted to draw three-dimensional pictures of everything.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.460
Especially the round cake picture.

18:42.460 --> 18:43.460
Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.460
Then the tree-shaped picture.

18:45.460 --> 18:46.460
Then this kind of picture.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.460
Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.460
But you see, this three-dimensional picture

18:50.460 --> 18:51.460
has no extra points at all.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.460
And it's very ugly.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.460
So everyone must master a trick when drawing pictures.

18:56.460 --> 18:59.460
You have to draw a picture in a simple way.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
This is the best way for everyone to understand.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.460
If you draw a 3D picture,

19:03.460 --> 19:05.460
it often has no extra points.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.460
Even if it's a round cake picture,

19:07.460 --> 19:09.460
we also want it to be a two-dimensional round cake picture.

19:09.460 --> 19:10.460
We don't want it to be a three-dimensional round cake picture.

19:10.460 --> 19:12.460
You can be a very beautiful two-dimensional picture.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.460
That's better than a three-dimensional picture.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.460
Because the three-dimensional picture will be a bit oblique.

19:16.460 --> 19:20.460
So it's hard to compare the size of each sector.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
Then this three-dimensional picture is even more exaggerated.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.460
It's uglier.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.460
This picture, as you can see, is very strange.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.460
This picture has no data points at all.

19:34.460 --> 19:37.460
And it's empty.

19:37.460 --> 19:41.460
This picture is very, very empty.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.460
Then there is no data point.

19:43.460 --> 19:46.460
It looks like a picture with very little information.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.460
This picture either needs to be removed.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.460
Otherwise, you have to add more data.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.460
Or add more information.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.460
This picture is too empty.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.460
What about this picture?

19:57.460 --> 20:00.460
Let's see if you can see it.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.460
Where is the problem with this picture?

20:06.460 --> 20:11.460
This is also a picture that I often see in my students' reports.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.460
I can't see where the problem is.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.460
But I don't know what this picture is talking about.

20:31.460 --> 20:37.460
This picture is more professional.

20:37.460 --> 20:41.460
The biggest problem with this picture is the error bar.

20:44.460 --> 20:48.460
The error bar should be visible from top to bottom.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.460
Especially the black one.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.460
Can you see these two sides?

20:51.460 --> 20:54.460
You can hardly see these four black errors.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.460
Then William said the unit.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
Yes, there is no unit.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.460
They didn't tell you how high this is.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.460
What does it mean to be high?

21:06.460 --> 21:08.460
And what is the unit of this activity?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
This is also a very good point.

21:13.460 --> 21:17.460
So this error bar is a lot of experiments.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.460
Especially social science.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.460
It's a lot of experiments.

21:21.460 --> 21:22.460
There was originally an error bar.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.460
You shouldn't go up.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.460
Because you want to talk about two things.

21:26.460 --> 21:27.460
What does it have to do with?

21:27.460 --> 21:29.460
Or you have to compare two things.

21:29.460 --> 21:30.460
One is high, one is low.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.460
You have to call the error bar.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.460
You can make an effective comparison.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.460
So the error bar is what people do most often.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.460
The point where the tree map is forgotten.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.460
Then the error bar must be very clear.

21:40.460 --> 21:41.460
Be sure to come out.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.460
Don't use it like this.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
You can't even see it in black.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.460
This is a similar problem we just talked about.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
It's a tasteless 3D.

21:49.460 --> 21:50.460
Look at this 3D.

21:50.460 --> 21:51.460
There is no bonus.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.460
There is no bonus at all.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.460
Below this is even worse.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.460
So we've seen a few pictures now.

22:00.460 --> 22:01.460
Everyone has an opinion.

22:01.460 --> 22:04.460
Everyone probably knows how ugly the scientific map is.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.460
When you're drawing.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.460
When you finish the picture.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.460
You have to ask yourself.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.460
Is your picture so ugly?

22:09.460 --> 22:11.460
And then if you think it's ugly.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.460
You have to improve it a little bit.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
How can it be more beautiful?

22:14.460 --> 22:15.460
Is there enough information?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
OK.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.460
There's another big problem.

22:18.460 --> 22:19.460
Some pictures.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.460
After it's done.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.460
It's just that when you zoom in, it's a little bit of a blur.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.460
So this kind of blurred picture.

22:28.460 --> 22:29.460
We'll try to avoid it.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
Because a lot of people now.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
Some people may want to look at the details.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.460
I want to zoom in as much as I can.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
If you blur it.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.460
It's hard for people to look at the details.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.460
So we want all the pictures.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.460
Try to use the amount of pictures.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.460
But this is not absolute.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.460
I can only say that 80 to 90 percent of the pictures.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.460
It could be the amount of pictures.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.460
But.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.460
There are still a lot of pictures.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
They can't make the amount of pictures.

22:51.460 --> 22:52.460
For example, like this picture.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.460
For example, you take your experiment.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.460
Oh, that picture.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.460
You can't make the amount of pictures.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.460
You have to.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.460
It is what it is.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.460
You have to put it on like this.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.460
So you put these pictures in.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.460
It's okay, too.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.460
You just have to make sure it's high enough.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.460
It's more than 300 dpi.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.460
OK.

23:10.460 --> 23:13.460
That's the best thing about illustrator.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
It can make all your ideas.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.460
The amount of pictures.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.460
So.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
Go to the data visualization.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.460
It's just that he has some of these.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
It's basically.

23:25.460 --> 23:26.460
You have a data.

23:26.460 --> 23:28.460
You have to think about this data first.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.460
What story do you want to tell?

23:30.460 --> 23:33.460
And then how do you get this data to attract people?

23:33.460 --> 23:35.460
It's you.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.460
Um, I'm basically a little outlier.

23:37.460 --> 23:39.460
But these are the ones we just talked about.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.460
It's this data.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.460
He must love it.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
It looks beautiful and interesting.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.460
Or a very amazing fact.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.460
Or a very innovative idea.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.460
Or this data.

23:49.460 --> 23:52.460
To be able to tell you what the experiment I did is.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
Show it to you very clearly.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
OK.

23:56.460 --> 23:57.460
Uh, or.

23:57.460 --> 23:59.460
Some people will put some innovative pictures.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.460
Or some.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.460
Pictures that attract people's attention.

24:03.460 --> 24:04.460
Right?

24:04.460 --> 24:07.460
These pictures can reinforce some arguments or opinions.

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
For example, I'm going to talk about a point of view later.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
Uh, that point of view.

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
I might need a picture to support it.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
This picture is not necessarily my data picture.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.460
It's not necessarily my intention.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.460
But I can draw a process picture.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.460
Or go and talk about my more.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.460
More, uh, more profound.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.460
A more powerful one.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.460
A point of view.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.460
OK.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.460
So these are all things you might be able to put on the map.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.460
It's just that you're going to put it on the map.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.460
But this is a very good example.

24:33.460 --> 24:36.460
It's just that NASA is making a beautiful picture.

24:36.460 --> 24:37.460
It's still very good.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
Look at how beautiful this picture is.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
I'm not in this field at all.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.460
But when I look at this picture, I know what it's talking about.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.460
He's talking about the carbon dioxide level before us.

24:48.460 --> 24:50.460
It's been fluctuating all the time.

24:50.460 --> 24:53.460
But it's about less than 100 years from us.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.460
He just rushed up like this.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
So what's the conclusion of this picture?

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
It's about the million years.

24:59.460 --> 25:03.460
It's about the carbon dioxide of our atmosphere that's never been above this line.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.460
Boom.

25:04.460 --> 25:05.460
This picture.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
Just how clear it is.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
He has data.

25:08.460 --> 25:09.460
And then.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.460
It just tells you.

25:12.460 --> 25:16.460
It's just that you don't need to read a single article after you've read it.

25:16.460 --> 25:17.460
You know what it's about.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
This is a great picture.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.460
It's a picture that's perfect for the presentation.

25:21.460 --> 25:26.460
Or if your article is to be published in a magazine or in a school.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.460
This is a picture of what you're going to put in those places.

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
And you just need to put this picture in.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
Yeah, well, look at the background. It's beautiful, too.

25:33.460 --> 25:36.460
It's the background of the earth and the outer space.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.460
The background of the atmosphere.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.460
It's just that it makes you think.

25:40.460 --> 25:43.460
OK.

25:43.460 --> 25:47.460
So, like this picture, it's a very good, very good picture.

25:47.460 --> 25:51.460
This picture is also very good.

25:51.460 --> 25:53.460
This is the year.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.460
This is the year.

25:54.460 --> 25:58.460
And then the center axis is the solar radiation on the left.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.460
The temperature is on the right.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.460
And then you look at it and it's got an average value.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.460
The average value of 11 years.

26:06.460 --> 26:08.460
It's got this one in the hospital.

26:08.460 --> 26:11.460
It's very clear at a glance.

26:11.460 --> 26:12.460
Right?

26:12.460 --> 26:17.460
And then he's got, uh, he's got his, uh, uh, unit, like this.

26:18.460 --> 26:21.460
And then this picture, uh, there's one more thing that's worth it.

26:21.460 --> 26:27.460
What everyone likes is his, uh, the temperature is red.

26:27.460 --> 26:31.460
And then this solar radiation is yellow.

26:31.460 --> 26:33.460
It's the temperature. You'll feel hot.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.460
So you'll instinctively use red.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.460
And then the solar radiation is yellow because it's like the sun.

26:38.460 --> 26:39.460
So I'm going to use yellow.

26:39.460 --> 26:42.460
So, you know, when you're choosing colors, you're going to be able to choose colors.

26:42.460 --> 26:46.460
The easier it is for the reader to think about it, the better it is.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.460
And then you look at these two pictures.

26:48.460 --> 26:51.460
These beautiful pictures are usually black background, right?

26:51.460 --> 26:53.460
This kind of black background picture, you don't usually put it on paper.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.460
But I like it very much.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.460
Because it's just easy to catch.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
It's just catching.

26:57.460 --> 26:58.460
It's your audience's attention.

26:58.460 --> 27:02.460
It's just that when you see black and then there's a bright one, you're going to want to pay attention to it.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.460
It's just that it's psychological.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
It's just that everyone will be like this.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.460
So you're going to see this amazing picture.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
It's usually black background.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.460
And then you're going to think it's cool.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.460
So this is a very good example.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.460
This is also a very good memory picture.

27:16.460 --> 27:20.460
Okay, so this picture looks like it's talking about global warming.

27:20.460 --> 27:24.460
But it's just that this is a picture I picked up from the Internet.

27:24.460 --> 27:27.460
So it's not that he's a little bit of a realist.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.460
So we just talked about these things, right?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.460
What I'm talking about above is more like a sense of beauty.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.460
It's just that you have to keep writing articles.

27:37.460 --> 27:40.460
And then when you're criticized or you criticize someone, you develop a sense of beauty.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.460
So what do you actually do when you're writing a paper?

27:43.460 --> 27:46.460
Basically, you want to use as little ink as possible.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.460
So that the reader can get the most ideas in the shortest time.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.460
So you have to try to make your articles as short as possible.

27:52.460 --> 27:55.460
So at the beginning, you might be the first one to do it.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.460
It's a lot of pictures, a lot of words, a lot of tables.

27:58.460 --> 28:00.460
But you have to shorten it as much as you can.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.460
So you have to shorten it as much as you can.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.460
So you have to shorten it as much as you can.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.460
But you have to shorten it as much as you can.

28:07.460 --> 28:08.460
It's just two or three articles.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.460
It's just that you have to shorten it slowly.

28:10.460 --> 28:12.460
And then every time you review it, you have to look at it.

28:12.460 --> 28:15.460
Can I use a picture as a substitute for this paragraph?

28:15.460 --> 28:17.460
Is this paragraph really necessary?

28:17.460 --> 28:19.460
Or can I move on to the next page?

28:19.460 --> 28:22.460
So you have to keep reviewing this thing.

28:22.460 --> 28:28.460
And then in the end, your very messy ideas will turn into a beautiful paper.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.460
It just looks very clean.

28:30.460 --> 28:37.460
And then every space, every space in your paper will be used in a huge way.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.460
So what's the content?

28:42.460 --> 28:45.460
What content do you use to present when you're writing an article?

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
You might start writing when you're writing an article.

28:47.460 --> 28:48.460
There are some points.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.460
Oh, what's the instrument?

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
You'll make a big bar first.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.460
When you're making your big bar, you'll find that this part.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.460
I want to make it clear in words, but it's very difficult.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.460
I don't know how to make it clear.

28:59.460 --> 29:05.460
If your instrument is like the instrument or the experiment, it's usually hard to make it clear, right?

29:05.460 --> 29:07.460
That kind of thing that's hard to make clear.

29:07.460 --> 29:11.460
You can choose to use a picture as a substitute.

29:11.460 --> 29:14.460
For example, the first picture is like this.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.460
Or the experiment's instrument picture is like this.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.460
But if you have an instrument picture, your instrument is very simple.

29:19.460 --> 29:20.460
It's just a layer of shit.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.460
Then you don't have to.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
You just say, oh, I've got a layer of shit.

29:23.460 --> 29:26.460
You don't have to draw a shit over there.

29:26.460 --> 29:27.460
so

29:28.460 --> 29:33.460
It's got to be important, but it's hard to make it clear in words, and then you get a picture.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.460
So this is the picture.

29:35.460 --> 29:39.460
The second one is an effective and supportive point of view.

29:39.460 --> 29:44.460
You have to write your argument when you're writing an article, right?

29:44.460 --> 29:47.460
Someone says, I'm measuring this, this, this, and I found something, something.

29:47.460 --> 29:51.460
So when you say that, you need something to support your argument.

29:51.460 --> 29:55.460
What supports your argument, supporting your argument, is your data and your experiment.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.460
How do you get your data and your experiment to support your argument?

29:59.460 --> 30:04.460
Basically, you have to tell people your data, but there's a lot of data, a lot of numbers flying around.

30:04.460 --> 30:08.460
At this time, you can also take a picture of the experiment.

30:08.460 --> 30:11.460
That picture can clearly support your argument.

30:11.460 --> 30:16.460
When you first started making the picture, you might have a bunch of different pictures.

30:16.460 --> 30:19.460
You have to pick which pictures will be in the article.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.460
You just put it up.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.460
If you don't talk about it in the article, you don't put it up.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.460
Or you don't put it up at all.

30:25.460 --> 30:33.460
And then the third one is the third picture, which is what Jason just mentioned.

30:33.460 --> 30:38.460
This is an innovative picture, which is what you usually find difficult to make clear.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.460
It has your data arguments.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.460
This is the only two in the general paper.

30:41.460 --> 30:47.460
But when you want to get a better start, or when you want to face a wider audience.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.460
And then when your article is very important.

30:51.460 --> 30:56.460
You need to have a picture that can quickly make people understand what you're best at.

30:56.460 --> 30:58.460
Where's your paper?

30:58.460 --> 31:01.460
Is it a quick read of your conclusion or your logic?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.460
Or is it your most innovative part?

31:03.460 --> 31:07.460
This is an innovative picture.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.460
Like the two NASA pictures I just showed you.

31:13.460 --> 31:16.460
It's the third one, the innovative picture.

31:16.460 --> 31:19.460
It's the innovative picture, or the second one.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.460
But it's a library.

31:21.460 --> 31:24.460
It has a lot of things and a background.

31:24.460 --> 31:28.460
So it's basically a mix of two and three.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.460
Like this picture.

31:36.460 --> 31:41.460
Even if we're not in the same industry, we can see the conclusion right away.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.460
This picture is amazing.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.460
This kind of picture usually takes a long time to change.

31:47.460 --> 31:51.460
Each font, font, even the color and width have to be changed back and forth.

31:51.460 --> 31:53.460
This kind of picture is usually very important.

31:55.460 --> 31:58.460
If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.460
I'm talking a little fast.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.460
If you want me to speak slower, you can talk to me.

32:06.460 --> 32:10.460
These three pictures are also pictures on this Nature.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.460
The first one is data.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.460
The second one is the process.

32:14.460 --> 32:18.460
The third one is the most important conclusion.

32:18.460 --> 32:21.460
For example, what is a neuron cell?

32:21.460 --> 32:24.460
Release to another neuron cell.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.460
What are the receptors?

32:28.460 --> 32:30.460
This is the conclusion picture.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.460
Look at this picture.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
It's not your process, it's not your data.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.460
It's just a story.

32:36.460 --> 32:39.460
But this story, you can actually replace it with a couple of words.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
In the text.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
But he still chose to draw it.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
Because this idea is very important.

32:45.460 --> 32:49.460
You want the audience to catch this idea.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.460
So they draw this picture.

32:51.460 --> 32:53.460
Then the whole piece of paper may only put this picture.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.460
Or put this picture on the first page.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.460
This data picture, Illustrator can help.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.460
The second and third are the strengths of Illustrator.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.460
Draw this beautiful picture.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.460
This is the strength of Illustrator.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.460
This is the drawing process.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.460
We just talked about it a little bit.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.460
Basically, you have to prepare a picture.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.460
Prepare a good picture.

33:22.460 --> 33:24.460
Ask yourself some questions.

33:24.460 --> 33:27.460
I can put the slides up later.

33:27.460 --> 33:30.460
Because the content I prepared today is actually more than an hour.

33:30.460 --> 33:33.460
So I want to talk about something.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.460
I think you might be more interested.

33:35.460 --> 33:38.460
But if you want to slow down in some places.

33:38.460 --> 33:42.460
If you talk a little more, you can write it in the chat.

33:44.460 --> 33:46.460
Then we can go over.

33:46.460 --> 33:48.460
Basically, you have to prepare a picture.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.460
The idea of ​​a picture is the most important.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.460
You make sure what to do with this picture.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.460
Then you use the draft draft first.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
After you are sure to use this picture,

33:59.460 --> 34:02.460
The second thing you should do is to study the journal you want to submit.

34:02.460 --> 34:04.460
The style of this journal.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.460
For example, how big is his file?

34:06.460 --> 34:08.460
How big is the font?

34:08.460 --> 34:10.460
What font?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.460
He might have some regulations.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.460
Then you use your data.

34:14.460 --> 34:16.460
Because you are using MATLAB, Mathematica, or some data processing programs.

34:16.460 --> 34:18.460
Or Excel.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.460
When you use them to export, try to follow the standard output.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.460
The better you export here.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.460
The easier it will be to beautify it in the end.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.460
If you export it badly.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.460
It may take one or two hours to beautify it.

34:30.460 --> 34:32.460
To handle a picture.

34:32.460 --> 34:37.460
So when you export, it's best to try to follow the standard output.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
Then the third is that you get it all done.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
Then we start to draw.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.460
Then we start to beautify.

34:45.460 --> 34:52.460
This is the point of beautification.

34:52.460 --> 34:55.460
For example, how much font do you want to use?

34:55.460 --> 34:58.460
What kind of picture do you want to use?

34:58.460 --> 35:01.460
I probably made a list here.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.460
How to choose the color?

35:05.460 --> 35:08.460
I just made a list here.

35:08.460 --> 35:10.460
Does anyone want to go over?

35:10.460 --> 35:12.460
Or we can start talking about Illustrator.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.460
This table is what I prepared for everyone.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.460
This table is what I prepared for everyone.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.460
When you export this picture.

35:39.460 --> 35:41.460
Try to use the same amount of pictures.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.460
There's nothing you can do.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.460
If it's too big, just use JP.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.460
Just use a normal picture.

35:47.460 --> 35:49.460
Try to use the same amount of pictures.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
Do not mess with the picture.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.460
Do not mess with the picture.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.460
Then the third is that I think the average person may have not noticed.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.460
When do you use the line picture?

35:58.460 --> 36:00.460
When do you use the column picture?

36:00.460 --> 36:02.460
When do you use the column picture?

36:02.460 --> 36:04.460
The line picture is used in.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.460
When your X and Y are continuous.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.460
Then you have to show people a trend.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.460
If you don't want to show people a trend.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.460
You just want to compare some of the paper.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.460
Don't use the line picture.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.460
Don't use a little bit of the line picture.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.460
Don't connect it.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.460
Don't use a little bit.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.460
You have a line picture.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.460
You must be able to tell people.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.460
This thing grows up.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.460
Grow down or have a pit.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.460
You must have a thought like this.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.460
Then you use the line picture.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.460
You have to say.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.460
There are so many people without infection.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.460
There are so many people with infection.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.460
You are a project, a project, a project.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.460
This is the column picture.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.460
Then the opposite is still.

36:44.460 --> 36:46.460
If you want to tell people a trend.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.460
You can say I measure this thing.

36:48.460 --> 36:50.460
Get one measure.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.460
The second one gets two.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.460
The third one gets three.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.460
I want to show a trend.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.460
You may want to say I only measure three points.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.460
Can I use the column picture?

37:00.460 --> 37:02.460
The column picture will let people naturally.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.460
These two things are related to X and Y.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.460
But the column picture won't.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.460
Then a picture is best to convey one to two concepts.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.460
But you have to convey it very clearly.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.460
Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.460
Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.

37:18.460 --> 37:20.460
Four or five pictures or four or five concepts.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.460
There are too many lines.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.460
I don't know what I'm reading.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.460
Then the font size.

37:26.460 --> 37:28.460
You can adjust it yourself.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.460
You can adjust it yourself.

37:30.460 --> 37:32.460
Don't use less than 7pt.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.460
Don't use less than 7pt.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.460
You can't see the printout of the form.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.460
You can't see the printout of the form.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.460
Then I want to talk about the complete.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.460
Some ideas are posed with images.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.460
Some ideas are posed with images.

38:04.460 --> 38:06.460
Don't burn this thing.

38:06.460 --> 38:07.960
Don't burn this thing.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.960
It is necessary to have a data.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
But it's not important enough.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.960
But it's not important enough.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.960
But it's not important enough.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.960
Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
If you really want to show a folder,you can put this into the directory.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.960
But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.960
If you really want to show this big database with a folder.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.960
But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.960
Even if you have been programming better for a few years,

38:35.960 --> 38:38.960
people want to give others aさらを

38:40.960 --> 38:42.960
Try to detoxify.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.960
Humans don't use light yellow or yellow.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.960
Don't use light yellow or yellow.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
The simpler the color, the better.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
The simpler the color, the better.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.960
Red, blue, green are simple colors.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.960
If there is only one color to choose, choose blue.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.960
After you finish this color,

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
After you finish this color,

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
It's best to print it out with a black and white printer.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.960
After printing it out, you may find that

39:04.960 --> 39:06.960
Oh, I might have three lines.

39:06.960 --> 39:07.960
Oh, I might have three lines.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
Then I use different colors.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.960
Then I use different colors.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
This is not good.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
You'd better choose three colors.

39:13.960 --> 39:14.960
Then print it out.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.960
Then print it out.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.960
You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.960
You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.960
Or you can just use different colors for data points.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
Or you can just use different colors for data points.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
Because some people are red and green blind.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.960
So they can't tell the color.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
So if you don't know the color before you die,

39:29.960 --> 39:31.960
You have to use different shapes for data points.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.960
So you see a lot of experimental schools

39:33.960 --> 39:35.960
What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.960
What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
So if you basically make my outline,

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
So if you basically make my outline,

39:43.960 --> 39:45.960
The picture won't be too bad.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.960
If you want to make it very beautiful,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.960
The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.960
The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.960
It follows its style.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
For example, how much size it is, how much you use.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
For example, how much size it is, how much you use.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
How thick the line is.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.960
I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.960
If you like it, you can just take it away.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.960
I have a question here.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.960
Can I ask?

40:13.960 --> 40:15.960
I have a question here.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.960
I see a lot of articles

40:17.960 --> 40:19.960
And there will be insets in the picture.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.960
And there will be insets in the picture.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.960
There may be another example in one corner.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.960
There may be another example in one corner.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
Is this picture good?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
Is this picture good?

40:29.960 --> 40:31.960
Is this picture good?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.960
Or what is the situation?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.960
This is a very good question.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.960
Insets are very difficult to draw.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.960
Insets are very difficult to draw.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.960
So let me draw something simple.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.960
So let me draw something simple.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.960
Okay.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
I can't go forward so much...

41:05.960 --> 41:07.960
What?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
I can't go forward so much...

41:09.960 --> 41:11.960
Did you see it?

41:11.960 --> 41:13.960
I didn't see what I was drawing.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.960
No.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.960
You didn't see it either.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
I'll try again.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.960
I have a picture like this, right?

41:29.960 --> 41:31.960
For example, I want to put a picture on this empty space.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.960
If my line looks like this,

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
if my line looks like this,

41:41.960 --> 41:43.960
I have a blank space here.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.960
I feel, you know,

41:45.960 --> 41:47.960
I have something I want to explain.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.960
That little thing may not be so important

41:49.960 --> 41:51.960
I need to put a picture of myself.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
I just want to mention it a little bit.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.960
I can put it right here.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.960
You can use this picture.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.960
But if your picture

41:59.960 --> 42:01.960
It's not very good, it might look like this.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.960
But you still have a small insert,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.960
You think it could be added points.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.960
What can you do?

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
You can make this picture into a semi-log.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.960
You can make it a log.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.960
Then this will be squeezed over here.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.960
Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.960
Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.960
But don't make it too exaggerated.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.960
But don't make it too exaggerated.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.960
It's a balance.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.960
This is a good little trick.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.960
This is a good little trick.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.960
If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,

42:29.960 --> 42:31.960
If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,

42:31.960 --> 42:33.960
If this picture is important to you,

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.960
You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
I'll delete these two photos.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
I don't need to box.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.960
And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.960
And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.960
But that's not a bad thing.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.960
But that's not a bad thing.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.960
It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.960
My teacher read it first.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.440
The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.440
The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.

43:30.920 --> 43:32.920
You use 11 for the X and Y.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.920
You use 11 for the X and Y.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.920
The convention is 11 for the X and Y.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.920
The convention is 11 for the X and Y.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.920
It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.920
It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.920
Your tick is a smaller two font.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.920
Your tick is a smaller two font.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.920
It will become 9.

43:56.920 --> 43:58.920
It will become 9.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.720
3 is 11, so it's 9.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.220
The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

44:18.220 --> 44:20.220
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

44:20.220 --> 44:22.220
become 7?

44:22.220 --> 44:24.220
Because we follow them.

44:24.220 --> 44:26.220
The smallest ones become 7.

44:26.220 --> 44:28.220
The smallest ones become 7.

44:28.220 --> 44:30.220
So it becomes very crowded

44:30.220 --> 44:32.220
because you have to use the smallest font size.

44:32.220 --> 44:34.220
Sometimes you may want to explain

44:34.220 --> 44:36.220
some things,

44:36.220 --> 44:38.220
but you may find that

44:38.220 --> 44:40.220
you can't fit in your words.

44:40.220 --> 44:42.220
But don't be discouraged.

44:42.220 --> 44:44.220
When you do Incept,

44:44.220 --> 44:46.220
it's very crowded,

44:46.220 --> 44:48.220
so you have to make some space.

44:48.220 --> 44:50.220
But with Incept,

44:50.220 --> 44:52.220
the numbers inside are already 7.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.220
So you have to think about

44:54.220 --> 44:56.220
how to make it

44:56.220 --> 44:58.220
less crowded.

44:58.220 --> 45:00.220
less crowded.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.220
Sorry,

45:02.220 --> 45:04.220
I just thought of another question.

45:04.220 --> 45:06.220
Am I asking too many questions?

45:06.220 --> 45:08.220
No, no.

45:08.220 --> 45:10.220
When I write articles,

45:10.220 --> 45:12.220
I often encounter a problem.

45:12.220 --> 45:14.220
For example,

45:14.220 --> 45:16.220
the editor may tell me

45:16.220 --> 45:18.220
that the order of

45:18.220 --> 45:20.220
reference to figure

45:20.220 --> 45:22.220
in the article is wrong.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.220
For example,

45:24.220 --> 45:26.220
I may write

45:26.220 --> 45:28.220
and reference figure 1,

45:28.220 --> 45:30.220
and then reference figure 2B,

45:30.220 --> 45:32.220
and then reference figure 2A,

45:32.220 --> 45:34.220
and so on.

45:34.220 --> 45:36.220
But sometimes

45:36.220 --> 45:38.220
it's just a problem with the layout.

45:38.220 --> 45:40.220
I think this layout is better.

45:40.220 --> 45:42.220
It's better to show it on the layout.

45:42.220 --> 45:44.220
But when you're writing,

45:44.220 --> 45:46.220
it's better to show it in another direction.

45:46.220 --> 45:48.220
Do you have any suggestions?

45:48.220 --> 45:50.220
Okay.

45:50.220 --> 45:52.220
This problem

45:52.220 --> 45:54.220
is caused by the layout.

45:54.220 --> 45:56.220
When you encounter this problem,

45:56.220 --> 45:58.220
you may be very reluctant

45:58.220 --> 46:00.220
and may not know

46:00.220 --> 46:02.220
how to change the layout.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.220
Or how to move it

46:04.220 --> 46:06.220
to make it better.

46:06.220 --> 46:08.220
This problem

46:08.220 --> 46:10.220
is caused by the layout.

46:10.220 --> 46:12.220
Basically,

46:12.220 --> 46:14.220
you have to go back

46:14.220 --> 46:16.220
to the first change.

46:16.220 --> 46:18.220
Most of the time,

46:18.220 --> 46:20.220
you can't make it better.

46:20.220 --> 46:22.220
When you start writing,

46:22.220 --> 46:24.220
you have to try to avoid this problem.

46:24.220 --> 46:26.220
How do you avoid this problem?

46:26.220 --> 46:28.220
When you write your article,

46:28.220 --> 46:30.220
your logic should be one line.

46:30.220 --> 46:32.220
Sometimes,

46:32.220 --> 46:34.220
when we write articles,

46:34.220 --> 46:36.220
when we write A,

46:36.220 --> 46:38.220
we want to talk about B,

46:38.220 --> 46:40.220
and we want to talk about C.

46:40.220 --> 46:42.220
But if your article is one line,

46:42.220 --> 46:44.220
for example,

46:44.220 --> 46:46.220
I talk about A to B first,

46:46.220 --> 46:48.220
B to C,

46:48.220 --> 46:50.220
C to D.

46:50.220 --> 46:52.220
Or when I do the experiment,

46:52.220 --> 46:54.220
I talk about a point first.

46:54.220 --> 46:56.220
I only talk about one material.

46:56.220 --> 46:58.220
Then I may talk about another material later.

46:58.220 --> 47:00.220
If you do this,

47:00.220 --> 47:02.220
you can put all the pictures of this material

47:02.220 --> 47:04.220
in a small box.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.220
Then you won't have this cross-reference problem.

47:08.220 --> 47:10.220
So your problem is

47:10.220 --> 47:12.220
the logic of writing.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.220
You need to change it at the beginning.

47:16.220 --> 47:18.220
If you need to change it at the beginning,

47:18.220 --> 47:20.220
you can avoid it later.

47:22.220 --> 47:24.220
Thank you for your good question.

47:24.220 --> 47:26.220
If you have any questions,

47:26.220 --> 47:28.220
you can ask.

47:28.220 --> 47:30.220
This is also informal.

47:30.220 --> 47:32.220
I hope to help you

47:32.220 --> 47:34.220
if you have any questions.

47:38.220 --> 47:40.220
Next, I will talk about Illustrator.

47:44.220 --> 47:46.220
How many people have used Illustrator?

47:50.220 --> 47:52.220
One.

47:52.220 --> 47:54.220
Two.

47:54.220 --> 47:56.220
Three.

47:56.220 --> 47:58.220
Four.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.220
Five.

48:00.220 --> 48:02.220
Six.

48:02.220 --> 48:04.220
Seven.

48:04.220 --> 48:06.220
Eight.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.220
Nine.

48:08.220 --> 48:10.220
Ten.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.220
Eleven.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.220
Twelve.

48:14.220 --> 48:16.220
Thirteen.

48:16.220 --> 48:18.220
Fourteen.

48:18.220 --> 48:20.220
Fifteen.

48:20.220 --> 48:22.220
Sixteen.

48:22.220 --> 48:24.220
Illustrator's philosophy

48:24.220 --> 48:26.220
is a little different

48:26.220 --> 48:28.220
from other software.

48:30.220 --> 48:32.220
If you download Illustrator,

48:32.220 --> 48:34.220
you will see the interface like this.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.220
The middle is your drawing board.

48:38.220 --> 48:40.220
On the right,

48:44.220 --> 48:46.220
there are tools you often use on the left.

48:48.220 --> 48:50.220
For example,

48:50.220 --> 48:52.220
you can add text,

48:52.220 --> 48:54.220
add a frame,

48:54.220 --> 48:56.220
and so on.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.220
On the top,

49:00.220 --> 49:02.220
after you choose a tool,

49:02.220 --> 49:04.220
for example,

49:04.220 --> 49:06.220
I choose the first arrow.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.220
After I choose the arrow,

49:08.220 --> 49:10.220
there will be some tool details on it.

49:10.220 --> 49:12.220
This detail will change

49:12.220 --> 49:14.220
according to the tool you choose.

49:14.220 --> 49:16.220
For example,

49:16.220 --> 49:18.220
when I choose the arrow,

49:18.220 --> 49:20.220
I will choose a frame.

49:20.220 --> 49:22.220
When I choose a frame,

49:22.220 --> 49:24.220
I will adjust the thickness of the frame,

49:24.220 --> 49:26.220
the color of the frame,

49:26.220 --> 49:28.220
the color of the frame,

49:28.220 --> 49:30.220
the sharpness of the frame,

49:30.220 --> 49:32.220
the roundness of the frame,

49:32.220 --> 49:34.220
the style of the frame,

49:34.220 --> 49:36.220
or the transparency of the frame.

49:36.220 --> 49:38.220
You can basically find it here.

49:40.220 --> 49:42.220
If you can't find it,

49:42.220 --> 49:44.220
it may have this function.

49:44.220 --> 49:46.220
But you have to go to the list

49:46.220 --> 49:48.220
and look for it carefully.

49:48.220 --> 49:50.220
On the right,

49:50.220 --> 49:52.220
there are some advanced tools.

49:52.220 --> 49:54.220
The tools on the right

49:54.220 --> 49:56.220
are the tools I often use.

49:56.220 --> 49:58.220
This one is personalized.

49:58.220 --> 50:00.220
Usually, when you get it,

50:00.220 --> 50:02.220
there may only be one or two.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.220
As you use it for a long time,

50:04.220 --> 50:06.220
you can drag the tools you often use

50:06.220 --> 50:08.220
to this side.

50:08.220 --> 50:10.220
For example,

50:10.220 --> 50:12.220
I often use this one for building.

50:12.220 --> 50:14.220
Or adjust the line.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.220
There are also some colors for drawing.

50:16.220 --> 50:18.220
I often put them here.

50:18.220 --> 50:20.220
This is an advanced tool list.

50:20.220 --> 50:22.220
Okay.

50:22.220 --> 50:24.220
There is a question here.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.220
Yan is asking

50:26.220 --> 50:28.220
in the chat room.

50:28.220 --> 50:30.220
Do you recommend any open source software

50:30.220 --> 50:32.220
corresponding to Illustrator?

50:32.220 --> 50:34.220
No.

50:34.220 --> 50:36.220
Because I always use

50:36.220 --> 50:38.220
school software.

50:40.220 --> 50:42.220
I always use school software.

50:42.220 --> 50:44.220
I always use school software.

50:44.220 --> 50:46.220
In the chat room,

50:46.220 --> 50:48.220
someone mentioned Inkscape.

50:48.220 --> 50:50.220
It seems to be an open source software.

50:50.220 --> 50:52.220
Someone mentioned

50:52.220 --> 50:54.220
that it seems to be

50:54.220 --> 50:56.220
the open source of Illustrator.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.220
Oh.

50:58.220 --> 51:00.220
What is it called?

51:00.220 --> 51:02.220
I can see it later.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.220
Okay.

51:04.220 --> 51:06.220
When you open

51:06.220 --> 51:08.220
Illustrator,

51:08.220 --> 51:10.220
I think you should talk about its logic first.

51:10.220 --> 51:12.220
Then you will know.

51:12.220 --> 51:14.220
The logic of Illustrator's drawing

51:14.220 --> 51:16.220
is like this.

51:16.220 --> 51:18.220
If you have never used this software,

51:18.220 --> 51:20.220
you are drawing in

51:20.220 --> 51:22.220
Illustrator or

51:22.220 --> 51:24.220
Powerpoint.

51:24.220 --> 51:26.220
For example,

51:26.220 --> 51:28.220
I draw a star.

51:28.220 --> 51:30.220
It is a star.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.220
You can't do anything

51:32.220 --> 51:34.220
to this star.

51:34.220 --> 51:36.220
For example,

51:36.220 --> 51:38.220
I want this star to have one less corner.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.220
But I want this star to be a hexagon.

51:40.220 --> 51:42.220
I can't do this.

51:42.220 --> 51:44.220
And this star,

51:44.220 --> 51:46.220
I might want it not to be so fat.

51:46.220 --> 51:48.220
I might want it to be a little thinner.

51:48.220 --> 51:50.220
What about this picture?

51:50.220 --> 51:52.220
The star on the left

51:52.220 --> 51:54.220
doesn't give you any wiggle room.

51:54.220 --> 51:56.220
You can't do this.

51:56.220 --> 51:58.220
But in Illustrator,

51:58.220 --> 52:00.220
when it reads a star,

52:00.220 --> 52:02.220
it reads a star like this on the right.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.220
Have you ever seen this dot?

52:04.220 --> 52:06.220
The square of this entity.

52:06.220 --> 52:08.220
This dot is called an anchor.

52:08.220 --> 52:10.220
This is a dot.

52:10.220 --> 52:12.220
This protruding thing

52:12.220 --> 52:14.220
will have a dot.

52:14.220 --> 52:16.220
The dot is connected

52:16.220 --> 52:18.220
by a straight line.

52:18.220 --> 52:20.220
Illustrator reads this picture

52:20.220 --> 52:22.220
and it reads a lot of dots.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.220
These dots

52:24.220 --> 52:26.220
will be connected by a straight line.

52:26.220 --> 52:28.220
These dots will be connected by a straight line.

52:28.220 --> 52:30.220
These dots will be connected by a straight line.

52:30.220 --> 52:32.220
But you may not want these dots,

52:32.220 --> 52:34.220
but want a curved line.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.220
That's why you-

52:38.220 --> 52:40.220
hm.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.220
That's why you

52:42.220 --> 52:44.220
have these dots.

52:44.220 --> 52:46.220
This dot is basically

52:46.220 --> 52:48.220
that line doesn't want a straight line.

52:48.220 --> 52:50.220
I want it to curve.

52:50.220 --> 52:52.220
So when you draw a circle,

52:52.220 --> 52:54.220
for example, for a circle not a straight line

52:54.220 --> 52:56.220
but a curved line,

52:56.220 --> 52:58.220
you can pick up this dot

52:58.220 --> 53:00.220
and draw a curve.

53:00.220 --> 53:02.220
I'll show you later.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.220
At this time,

53:04.220 --> 53:06.220
there will be two handles.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.220
These handles

53:12.220 --> 53:14.220
will control the curve of the line.

53:14.220 --> 53:16.220
So you can think about

53:16.220 --> 53:18.220
how we usually draw.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.220
Basically, it's all this idea.

53:20.220 --> 53:22.220
You draw a dot,

53:22.220 --> 53:24.220
connect the dots with the lines,

53:24.220 --> 53:26.220
and then adjust the curve of the line.

53:26.220 --> 53:28.220
Okay.

53:28.220 --> 53:30.220
Okay.

53:30.220 --> 53:32.220
That's it.

53:32.220 --> 53:34.220
Today,

53:38.220 --> 53:40.220
we're running out of time.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.220
I was going to-

53:48.220 --> 53:50.220
There's a lot more, right?

53:50.220 --> 53:52.220
Otherwise,

53:52.220 --> 53:54.220
I-

53:54.220 --> 53:56.220
This is-

53:56.220 --> 53:58.220
I found this on the Internet.

53:58.220 --> 54:00.220
Basically,

54:00.220 --> 54:02.220
I'm going to draw a picture for you to see.

54:02.220 --> 54:04.220
And then-

54:06.220 --> 54:08.220
Okay.

54:08.220 --> 54:10.220
I'm going to draw a picture

54:10.220 --> 54:12.220
for you to see.

54:12.220 --> 54:14.220
And then,

54:14.220 --> 54:16.220
I can give you these tips

54:16.220 --> 54:18.220
in PDF format.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.220
You can understand it by looking at it directly.

54:20.220 --> 54:22.220
For example, how thick the line should be.

54:22.220 --> 54:24.220
You can look at it directly.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.220
And how to start learning.

54:26.220 --> 54:28.220
Okay, no problem.

54:32.220 --> 54:34.220
I'll draw a picture for you to see first.

54:34.220 --> 54:36.220
This way, you'll have more ideas.

54:38.220 --> 54:40.220
Okay.

54:40.220 --> 54:42.220
This picture is-

54:42.220 --> 54:44.220
I found this picture on the Internet.

54:44.220 --> 54:46.220
I drew this picture.

54:46.220 --> 54:48.220
It took me about an hour

54:48.220 --> 54:50.220
to reproduce this picture.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.220
Okay, so look at this picture.

54:52.220 --> 54:54.220
If you zoom in, it's a little blurry.

54:54.220 --> 54:56.220
And then the next one,

54:56.220 --> 54:58.220
I used Illustrator to draw the picture.

54:58.220 --> 55:00.220
Look, it's very clear when you zoom in.

55:00.220 --> 55:02.220
Okay.

55:02.220 --> 55:04.220
So how do I draw these pictures?

55:04.220 --> 55:06.220
Okay, let me-

55:10.220 --> 55:12.220
Okay.

55:16.220 --> 55:18.220
Let me-

55:36.220 --> 55:38.220
Let me see how I can

55:38.220 --> 55:40.220
zoom in.

55:46.220 --> 55:48.220
Okay.

55:52.220 --> 55:54.220
Let me-

55:54.220 --> 55:56.220
This is what I drew yesterday.

55:56.220 --> 55:58.220
Okay.

55:58.220 --> 56:00.220
So, look at this picture.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.220
I drew it one by one

56:02.220 --> 56:04.220
the way I told you.

56:04.220 --> 56:06.220
So,

56:06.220 --> 56:08.220
in this picture,

56:08.220 --> 56:10.220
do you have any-

56:10.220 --> 56:12.220
For example,

56:12.220 --> 56:14.220
I want to draw this tube.

56:14.220 --> 56:16.220
Okay, I want to draw this tube.

56:16.220 --> 56:18.220
Two circles plus a bar.

56:24.220 --> 56:26.220
How do I draw this picture?

56:26.220 --> 56:28.220
Okay, let me think about this picture.

56:28.220 --> 56:30.220
This picture is basically two circles plus a bar.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.220
So I'm going to draw two circles first.

56:36.220 --> 56:38.220
First,

56:38.220 --> 56:40.220
I'll- Okay.

56:40.220 --> 56:42.220
This is my tool, right?

56:42.220 --> 56:44.220
I'm going to choose something.

56:44.220 --> 56:46.220
Okay, I'll choose this one.

56:46.220 --> 56:48.220
This is a square, right?

56:48.220 --> 56:50.220
Okay.

56:50.220 --> 56:52.220
So this square,

56:52.220 --> 56:54.220
I'm going to click on this square again.

56:56.220 --> 56:58.220
Or there's a little triangle below.

56:58.220 --> 57:00.220
I don't know if you can see it.

57:00.220 --> 57:02.220
Okay, just click on it.

57:02.220 --> 57:04.220
My computer is a little slow right now.

57:08.220 --> 57:10.220
Okay.

57:10.220 --> 57:12.220
And then this picture can-

57:12.220 --> 57:14.220
This little tool can tell you,

57:14.220 --> 57:16.220
okay, you want to draw a square,

57:16.220 --> 57:18.220
but I don't have any other squares to choose from.

57:18.220 --> 57:20.220
For example, I have a circle,

57:20.220 --> 57:22.220
and then I have this kind of smooth

57:22.220 --> 57:24.220
or a star, and so on.

57:24.220 --> 57:26.220
Okay, I'm going to choose a circle now.

57:26.220 --> 57:28.220
So I'm going to choose a circle now.

57:28.220 --> 57:30.220
Is this how I draw it?

57:30.220 --> 57:32.220
Okay, so it's hard for me to say

57:32.220 --> 57:34.220
that I can draw a real circle, right?

57:34.220 --> 57:36.220
I just want to draw a real circle.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.220
So how do you draw a real circle?

57:38.220 --> 57:40.220
You can press Shift.

57:40.220 --> 57:42.220
And then pull.

57:42.220 --> 57:44.220
This circle must be a real circle.

57:44.220 --> 57:46.220
There are some shortcut keys in Illustrator.

57:46.220 --> 57:48.220
These shortcut keys will suggest you to memorize

57:48.220 --> 57:50.220
this circle.

57:52.220 --> 57:54.220
Okay, so I have a circle now.

57:54.220 --> 57:56.220
So I'm going to-

57:56.220 --> 57:58.220
I want another circle below,

57:58.220 --> 58:00.220
so I'm going to draw another circle.

58:02.220 --> 58:04.220
So I drew a circle,

58:04.220 --> 58:06.220
and then I want to use a square

58:06.220 --> 58:08.220
to connect them together.

58:08.220 --> 58:10.220
Right? Okay.

58:10.220 --> 58:12.220
Basically, I have this picture.

58:12.220 --> 58:14.220
But this picture looks ugly.

58:14.220 --> 58:16.220
I want these colors to be right.

58:16.220 --> 58:18.220
For example,

58:18.220 --> 58:20.220
I want this to be black.

58:20.220 --> 58:22.220
What if this is black?

58:22.220 --> 58:24.220
What I'm drawing now is this object.

58:24.220 --> 58:26.220
Okay, I'm going to choose this black.

58:26.220 --> 58:28.220
And then I can choose-

58:28.220 --> 58:30.220
You see,

58:32.220 --> 58:34.220
this thing,

58:34.220 --> 58:36.220
there are some things you can do.

58:36.220 --> 58:38.220
The first one is the color inside.

58:38.220 --> 58:40.220
I choose black inside.

58:40.220 --> 58:42.220
Okay, and then there's no color outside.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.220
What about this object?

58:46.220 --> 58:48.220
I can also choose black inside.

58:48.220 --> 58:50.220
And then there's no color outside.

58:52.220 --> 58:54.220
What about this object?

58:54.220 --> 58:56.220
I can also choose black inside.

58:56.220 --> 58:58.220
There's no color outside.

58:58.220 --> 59:00.220
I can also have three boxes

59:00.220 --> 59:02.220
and do this thing together.

59:02.220 --> 59:04.220
Now I've drawn

59:04.220 --> 59:06.220
a tube like this.

59:08.220 --> 59:10.220
I want them to be a little bit symmetrical.

59:10.220 --> 59:12.220
Because I'm just drawing a circle

59:12.220 --> 59:14.220
and then I'm drawing a bar inside.

59:14.220 --> 59:16.220
It might not be very symmetrical.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.220
We might want it to look better.

59:18.220 --> 59:20.220
When you think about this thing,

59:20.220 --> 59:22.220
Illustrator does a very intuitive job.

59:22.220 --> 59:24.220
You just pick these three things up

59:24.220 --> 59:26.220
and look at what you can do

59:26.220 --> 59:28.220
with this object on top.

59:28.220 --> 59:30.220
You'll see Align on top.

59:30.220 --> 59:32.220
How do you align it?

59:32.220 --> 59:34.220
You want to have two objects

59:34.220 --> 59:36.220
aligned in the middle.

59:36.220 --> 59:38.220
You can align it like this.

59:38.220 --> 59:40.220
Now these three things are

59:40.220 --> 59:42.220
beautifully aligned together.

59:42.220 --> 59:44.220
I'm going to add text on top later,

59:44.220 --> 59:46.220
so I want these three things

59:46.220 --> 59:48.220
to be connected together.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.220
I want these three objects

59:52.220 --> 59:54.220
to be connected into one object.

59:54.220 --> 59:56.220
If I want to do this,

59:56.220 --> 59:58.220
I can come here and choose

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.220
Reshape Builder.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.220
It reshapes your object.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.220
I'm going to click on this.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.220
I'm going to move the cursor

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.220
to the first one and then move it down.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.220
Look, the first one and the second one

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.220
are merged together.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.220
The third one is merged together.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.220
The fourth one is merged together.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.220
The fifth one is merged together.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.220
When I let go,

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.220
this whole thing becomes an object.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.220
I'm not going to draw a circle

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.220
and then the shape of the circle

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.220
becomes exactly the same.

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.220
I'm going to choose a color.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.220
I'm going to choose this color.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.220
This color is ugly.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.220
Now I can choose this object.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.220
Now I've created a shape.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.220
After you've created a shape,

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.220
you want to fill it in.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.220
You want to fill it in.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.220
You want to fill it in.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.220
How do you fill it in?

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220
You can draw another one,

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.220
but it's hard to make it

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.220
exactly the same.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.220
So what we're going to do

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.220
is copy this thing.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.220
If we can cut it off

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.220
and paste it on,

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.220
it'll be exactly the same.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.220
How do I cut this thing off?

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.220
When I want to cut this thing off,

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.220
I'm going to do some cutting

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.220
on this whole object.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.220
Do you remember

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.220
the Illustrator logic I just talked about?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.220
There are two little dots here.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.220
There are two little dots here.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.220
The first thing you need to learn

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.220
when you learn Illustrator

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.220
is to select an object

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.220
and then you can do some settings

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.220
on this object.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.220
The second thing you need to learn

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.220
is to select the most basic element

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.220
in this object.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.220
is to select the most basic element

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.220
in this object.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.220
So when I click on this little dot,

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.220
So when I click on this little dot,

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.220
look at my object.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.220
I don't know if you can see it.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.220
It's a little small.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.220
It's a little small.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.220
There's a dot here.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.220
There's a dot here.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:26.220
If you can't see it,

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.220
you can tell me in the chat.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.220
I've got a lot of dots.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.220
These dots are the dots.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.220
I don't need this dot anymore.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220
I don't need this dot anymore.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.220
Because I only need the bottom.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.220
I can delete it.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.220
You see, my picture is gone.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.220
You see, my picture is gone.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.220
So I can edit it directly.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.220
So I can edit it directly.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.220
So I've got an element.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.220
I don't need the dots.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.220
I don't need the dots.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.220
There's a trouble with this little dot.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.220
What do I do now?

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.220
What do I do now?

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.220
I canamazit these dots.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.220
I canamazit these dots.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.220
The dots I need turn blue.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.220
The dots I need turn blue.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.220
This allows

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.220
press down key.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.220
press down key.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.220
press down key.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.220
press down key.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.220
Look, it becomes shorter.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.220
Now I can Add a different color.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.220
Now I can Add a different color.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.220
Now I move it.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.220
When I move it...

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.220
When I move it...

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.220
Why is it not aligned?

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.220
When I move it...

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.220
When I was modifying it,

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.220
I accidentally made it smaller.

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.220
Now I can move it.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.220
When I was modifying it,

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.220
I accidentally made it smaller.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.220
When I move it...

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.220
Now it looks like this.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.220
I can modify it a little bit more.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.220
I want to make sure these two things are aligned.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.220
Now I have a tube.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.220
Now I have a tube.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.220
It's not perfect at the bottom.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.220
You can modify it a few more times.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.220
You can make it bigger and modify it a few more times.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.220
Now I can copy this.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.220
Now I have a tube.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.220
Now I have a tube.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.220
If you need to,

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.220
I can show you how to make it.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.220
I can show you how to make it.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.220
If you want to learn how to do this,

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.220
you can use that.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:06.220
Now I'm going to draw a star.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.220
Now I'm going to draw a star.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.220
draw a star

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.220
There are five legs on this star.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.220
I could just make it six legs.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.220
I could just press the up and down buttons to make it have more legs.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.220
Or I could press the down button to make it have less legs.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.220
Illustrator has a lot of shortcut keys.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.220
You basically have to practice to remember.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.220
For example, I'm using this leg now.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.220
And this is my new star, right?

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.220
I think this star is too sharp.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.220
I don't want it to be so sharp.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.220
I want it to be round.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.220
How do I make it round?

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.220
I can choose this.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.220
I'm going to use this to change the inner components of this star.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.220
We just talked about the dots.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:12.220
The dots tell you that there must be a dot on these dots.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.220
I'm going to change the curve of this line.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.220
I'm going to pull this circle.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.220
See if my star is getting fat and round.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.220
It's getting fatter and rounder.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.220
For example, you don't want this star to be symmetrical.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.220
You want this leg to stand out.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.220
You can also use this to choose.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.220
For example, I want these two dots to stand out.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.220
I'm going to choose these two dots and pull them out.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.220
I might want these two dots to be particularly sharp.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.220
So I'm going to change the curve, right?

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:57.220
At this time, you can also use this to choose this dot.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.220
I'm going to zoom in on this dot.

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.220
After you click on this dot, do you see this line up here?

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.220
This line is called the handle.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.220
This handle is to control the curvature.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.220
See if this is particularly sharp now.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.220
Or you can make a big one like this.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.220
I'm going to zoom in now.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.220
So when you look at someone else's picture,

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.220
and you draw a picture,

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.220
you're thinking,

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.220
which basic shape can I start to transform?

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.220
Sir, we have a question here.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.220
This is a question about

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:47.220
whether the picture will be set to the size of the picture you want first,

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.220
or do you draw it first and then set it?

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.220
Another audience member also said,

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:02.220
I'm also curious about how to integrate real photos into pictures.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.220
OK.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.220
Integrate real photos into pictures,

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.220
is it pulling a picture in?

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.220
I think that's what it means.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.220
For example, if he has a picture of a lab device,

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.220
how do you integrate it in?

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.220
OK.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.220
I'll talk about the first one first.

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.220
The first question is very, very good.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:31.220
I think this is a trick that only those who are doing this will know.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.220
I'll open one first.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.220
I'll open another one.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.220
This is a picture of my experiment.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:49.220
I got this picture from something like Excel.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.220
And then I dragged it over,

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.220
and then I beautified it like this.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220
OK.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.220
In the process of beautifying,

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.220
you see,

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.220
will I make the painting board the size I want?

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220
I won't.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.220
There are a lot of reasons why I don't do this.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.220
Because this painting board is white.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.220
When you're painting,

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.220
if you need something to...

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.220
For example, when I'm painting now,

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.220
I might have done something first.

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.220
For example, I made a star.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.220
I'm going to use it later.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.220
But if my painting board is very small now,

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.220
then my star...

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.220
For example, I can change it now.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.220
I can change the painting board directly.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.220
OK.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.220
For example, I can change the painting board.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.220
If my painting board is very, very small at first,

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.220
If my painting board is very, very small at first,

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.220
You see, when my painting board is very small,

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:04.220
the problem is that my object will be squeezed onto the painting board.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.220
Then it will be a little hard for me to see clearly.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.220
Because the background is gray.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.220
Usually white is easier to paint.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.220
So what do I do?

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.220
I usually use a very large painting board.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.220
And then?

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.220
For example, I want to deal with this data now.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.220
Suppose I haven't finished this data.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220
I still want to deal with this data.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.220
I want to add something.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220
OK.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.220
I can put this...

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.220
I can put this thing next to it first.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.220
And then I'll draw something first.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.220
I'll draw...

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.220
I'll draw the last thing I need.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.220
Where is it?

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.220
Here.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:48.220
Suppose I want to put this last picture on a two-column paper.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.220
So I'm going to put it on a...

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.220
Wait a minute.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.220
Black. OK.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.220
This is...

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.220
This is the last thing I'm going to put on the paper.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.220
I'm going to put a picture in this space.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.220
Usually, if the paper is a two-column...

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.220
Wait a minute. I'm going to make it bigger.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.220
OK.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.220
I'm going to choose this square now.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.220
I'm just going to pull a square.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.220
And then I'm going to adjust the width and length of this square.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.220
That's the width and height of the square.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:36.220
I usually use 3.75 inches for a two-column paper.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.220
Let me see.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.220
I wrote it all down below.

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.220
How do you draw it?

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.220
3.75 inches.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.220
If it's a double column, it's 3.75 inches.

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.220
If it's a single column, it's 89 milliliters.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.220
OK.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:55.220
I'm going to use 3.75 inches for this thing.

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.220
That's it.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.220
OK.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.220
And then I'm going to draw a picture.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.220
I'm going to put this picture...

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.220
I'm going to put my data picture in.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.220
And then I can adjust this data picture.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.220
OK.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.220
For example, I want it to be smaller.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.220
Because I want to put another picture next to it.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.220
I want it to be smaller.

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.220
Like this.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.220
OK.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.220
Like this.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.220
Like this.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.220
OK.

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.220
OK.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.220
Then I'll put a picture here.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.220
And then...

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.220
And then I'll put another picture here.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:44.220
And then I'll put another picture here.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.220
You'll think it's a little crowded.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.220
And then you might have to make each picture smaller.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.220
Anyway...

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.220
You just put this grid...

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.220
I drew this grid as your final size.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.220
And then you put your data in first.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.220
And then you can start to adjust it inside.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.220
For example, you can change this word.

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.220
I can add a text here.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.220
I can re-enter the text.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.220
And then I'm sure this text is 11PT.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.220
For example, number.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.220
I'm going to pull this over here.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.220
Like this.

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220
You know what I mean?

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:25.220
All your drafts are placed outside this box.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.220
And then you put your final product in this box.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.220
And then you just do it in there.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.220
OK.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.220
So when I'm done with this picture.

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.220
This picture is already very beautiful.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.220
OK.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220
All done.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.220
I'm going to export this picture.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.220
At this time, you put the things outside.

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.220
For example, there may be some squares outside.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.220
You delete all these things.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220
OK.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.220
Delete all the objects outside.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.220
After deleting it, keep this box.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.220
This box can't be deleted.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.220
Keep this box.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220
Keep this box.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.220
And then turn the outer frame of this box into a transparent one.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.220
Transparent.

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.220
And then at this time, you export it again.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.220
OK.

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.220
At this time, you can save as.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.220
For example, I'll save it as an EPS.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.220
Like this.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.220
Example.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.220
For example, test1.

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.220
And then when you export it, you have to choose a blank background.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.220
Choose transparent.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.220
OK.

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220
And then I'll export it.

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.220
At this time, the picture I exported will be exactly.

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.220
Just right.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.220
This frame.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.220
This white frame.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.220
It's just right.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.220
It's the frame you want to put on the paper.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.220
This width is just right.

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.220
3.75 inches.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.220
This is the bottom of this piece of white.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.220
When you put the whole picture on it.

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.220
You won't.

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.220
Because sometimes you use latex.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.220
Or when you put the picture in the text.

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.220
You'll zoom in.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.220
Because you want it to look pretty.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220
So when you zoom in.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.220
The font of that text.

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.220
It's going to zoom in with you.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220
The shape of the picture is going to zoom in with you.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.220
So maybe when you were drawing the picture.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.220
What are these fonts?

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.220
11pt.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.220
It looks very good.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.220
But because you zoom in.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.220
Maybe put it in the article.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.220
Hey, this 11 font.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220
Zoom in.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.220
Maybe it becomes 7.

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.220
Then you can't see it.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.220
It's almost invisible.

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.220
Hey.

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.220
So when you use Illustrator.

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:28.220
I usually divide my page into two sides.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.220
OK.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.220
And then the first thing I do.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.220
Is to put my last.

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.220
The size of this picture to be output.

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.220
Draw it out with a frame.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.220
And then the width of this frame can't change.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.220
But the length can change.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.220
For example, I want to add two more pictures.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220
It might get longer.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.220
Yeah.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.220
And then I use the right side as my drawing board.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.220
And then what am I going to draw?

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.220
What words do I write?

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.220
I'll take care of the right side.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.220
And then I'll stick it up here.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220
And then slowly align.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220
Yeah.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220
And then after the alignment.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.220
You just have to make sure there's nothing out there.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.220
And then this frame at the end.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.220
If you make it transparent.

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.220
Your output will be the whole one.

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.220
It's just like this.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.220
You won't be.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.220
There's more white on the side.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.220
Or the size doesn't fit.

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:11.220
What you want is exactly.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.220
What you draw is exactly what you want.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.220
Does that answer your question?

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.220
Yes.

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.220
I was answered.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.220
But I don't know if the actor was answered.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.220
OK.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.220
So you didn't know how to use the animation board at first.

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:39.220
The animation board is usually for people who do art.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.220
They need to be.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.220
When they're printing, there's a problem with the edge.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:47.220
So they're usually the ones who understand the animation board.

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220
But I think this is better.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.220
And what's the harm in moving the board?

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.220
You know, like, let's say I'm going to put my board.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.220
Make it the size I want.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.220
This is a big disadvantage.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.220
For example, I guess I will.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.220
Well, I was going to say, okay, I'm just.

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.220
Yeah, you know, all right.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.220
My eyes are good.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.220
I can see black and white.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.220
I'm going to use this direct.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.220
Is there any problem with the board?

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.220
Suppose I just made a drawing on the board.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.220
I've done it.

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.220
And I don't have this frame.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:21.220
I just drew, drew, drew, drew, drew, drew it out.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.220
Ok, I'm done.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220
I just want to say, all right.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.220
This is a.

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:28.220
This is the animation board that I want to output.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.220
At this time, I'm.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.220
At this time, I'm going to save.

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.220
And you can see where the difference is.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.220
Okay, have you seen the difference between this test and this test?

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.220
Look at this test.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.220
Is this the case where the grid is wider?

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:59.220
Is the grid of this test 2 getting narrower?

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.220
And then you see if this grid is getting narrower.

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.220
This distance is also a little wider.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.220
So why is that?

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:15.220
Why isn't it?

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.220
Look at how wide my panel is here.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.220
Look at how wide my panel is here.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:23.220
How does it look different from my final output?

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.220
Why is this so wide? Why is this so narrow?

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.220
On the contrary, if I used this grid at the beginning,

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.220
You see, this is so wide, this is so wide.

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.220
Right?

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.220
So why is this?

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:41.220
This is because when we're saving,

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.220
Because this is an image.

01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.220
So your program will use

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.220
Illustrator will use the simplest way to save your image.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.220
That is to say, you see,

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.220
If I frame all these tools,

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.220
You see, my tool actually only takes up so much of the panel.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.220
I didn't use the whole panel.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.220
So your computer will be very smart.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.220
It will choose this smallest frame.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.220
The space you actually use.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.220
And then you make it into a square and you output it directly.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.220
And if you don't use this place, it won't output.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.220
So what you're actually outputting is

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.220
It's a little bit wider than you want it to be.

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.220
There's a little bit of a gap.

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:22.220
So that's why I'm going to put a frame here.

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.220
To make sure that when you output it,

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.220
It's the whole frame that I want.

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.220
Got it.

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:34.220
Okay, Yan said she got it.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.220
Okay, good, good.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.220
What's the second question?

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:42.220
I think the audience has a lot of questions right now.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.220
Otherwise, we'll just answer the audience's questions directly.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:48.220
We'll take the rest of the time to answer the audience's questions, okay?

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.220
Okay, okay.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:57.220
The second question is how to integrate the actual photo into the picture.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.220
Okay.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.220
And then this question is also a very good question.

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.220
This is very tricky.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:08.220
I'm just sharing a screen.

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:14.220
I'm assuming I don't want these things now.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.220
And then I'm going to put a picture in there.

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:33.220
For example, I have a picture here.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.220
Okay, okay.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:41.220
And then you see, I just took this picture from my desktop.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.220
It's big now, isn't it?

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.220
So I'm going to shrink it a little bit now.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.220
I'm using the shortcut to shrink it now.

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.220
But if you have a magnifier here, you can also use this magnifier to shrink it.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.220
Okay, I'm going to shrink it now, and then I'm going to use the first one.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220
The first one.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.220
This is a picture.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:02.220
It can no longer be broken into components.

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.220
So when you choose, you always make the first choice.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.220
If you choose the second one, this picture will be easily destroyed by you.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.220
Okay, I've chosen this one now.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:13.220
Okay, so I'm going to shrink it now, and I'm going to put it on my drawing board.

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.220
And then I'm going to zoom in and see what it looks like.

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:36.220
If I want to put this picture up, I can just put it up.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.220
And then what's the advantage of Illustrator?

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:50.220
I'm on the left side of the picture, and I'm on the right side of the picture, right?

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.220
That's okay.

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:56.220
It's just a picture that's going to be a thing.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:59.220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.220
I'll save it.

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.220
So when you export it, both of them will export.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.220
So you say, okay, this is an EPS, it's supposed to be a image.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.220
So I'm not going to be a real one when I zoom in.

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.220
Okay, so the problem is, the left one is all really a real one.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.220
It's not going to be real.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:25.220
But the right one is.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.220
I've been zooming in and out.

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.220
You see, this MF is starting to be real.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.220
So you want to put a picture in and drag it in.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.220
It's very simple.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.220
But it's a little tricky.

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.220
You have to take this big picture.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.220
Because when you take this picture, it's a big file.

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.220
It's a big size.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.220
So I recommend all the pictures.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.220
Even if he's not with anyone else.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.220
If you want to put it on your own.

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.220
This picture is best handled by AI.

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.220
You just drag it in like this.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.220
There's only one picture in the whole panel.

01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.220
It's better to come in.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:04.220
Because when you come in, you can take it from the original size.

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:06.220
Maybe 1.3 megabytes.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.220
You just zoom in and out.

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.220
Now we have this panel.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.220
It's the size we're going to export.

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:17.220
For example, you want this picture to be this big.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.220
You can just look at it in this export size.

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.220
Is it still readable?

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:27.220
If I shrink it to this size, it's already blurred.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.220
That's just asking you to remake a picture.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:33.220
You need a high-resolution picture.

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:36.220
If you look at this picture, it's good.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.220
This picture is after I took it down.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.220
It's still very clear.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.220
You see, I put it in a big way.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.220
Normally, a paper wouldn't be that big.

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.220
Basically, it's still very clear.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.220
This picture is OK.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.220
This kind of photo doesn't usually require much.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.220
As long as you can see it when you zoom in.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.220
And the main feature is that you can see it.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.220
That's OK.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.220
So when you shrink this picture, make sure it's visible.

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.220
It's the first thing you have to do.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.220
The second thing you have to do is export it.

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:09.220
Like I just exported it to TAS 2, right?

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.220
I can come over now and see how big this TAS 2 is.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.220
It's 3.4 MB.

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.220
Compared to this one, my first one is a full-size picture.

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.220
It's only 1.1 MB.

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.220
As a result, after I added a picture, it became 3.4 MB.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.220
So when you're taking pictures,

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.220
Sometimes you use a very fancy camera.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.220
The picture you take is 4K.

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:34.220
The file is super big.

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:38.220
After you export it, it's 1 GB or 500 MB.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.220
That's not going to work.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.220
Because often, for example, if you add four pictures together,

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.220
It can only be, for example, 25 MB.

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.220
Then you put a high-resolution picture on it first.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.220
Basically, it takes up all your space.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.220
That's not going to work.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.220
What do you do at this time?

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.220
You have to go back and take this picture of yours.

01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.220
Use other software to lower its quality.

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.220
It's not that good resolution.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:02.220
But it's visible.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.220
So when you put the picture in,

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.220
You have to make sure the resolution is high enough.

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.220
It's high enough to be visible.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:10.220
But you have to make sure it's not too high.

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.220
Because it takes up a lot of resources.

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:22.220
So this is the main problem.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:28.220
And then some people might want to, for example,

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:34.220
For example, like this one, I just want to make a beautiful one.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:35.220
I'm going to give you a talk.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.220
I'm going to give you a beautiful picture like this.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.220
I want this picture to be the background of my data.

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.220
Suppose I want it to be the background of my data.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:44.220
I can do the same thing.

01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.220
I'm going to pull it to the size I want.

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.220
And then I want it to be at the bottom, right?

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:58.220
So I'm going to put this thing at the bottom.

01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.220
So my data will show up on top.

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.220
And then I can usually, if you do this kind of thing,

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.220
You're going to need opacity.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.220
I just want it to be a little transparent.

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.220
Like this.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.220
That's it.

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.220
It looks like this data is related to AI.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.220
Something like that.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.220
That's fine, too.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.220
But it's the same thing.

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.220
Every time you want to put in a picture,

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:25.220
You have to pay attention to the resolution of this picture.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.220
It doesn't have a set rule that says how much it has to be.

01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:30.220
The guideline is that you can see it when you zoom in.

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:31.220
That's it.

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.220
I had a real problem before.

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.220
How do you cut it?

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.220
Do you want this?

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.220
Yeah.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.220
Oh, you don't want it.

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.220
You're going to step on it, right?

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.220
Yeah.

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:48.220
Okay, let's get the opacity back first.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.220
Pull it back.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Okay.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.220
You just click on this.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.220
You just click on what you want to do.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.220
Basically, this bar up here.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.220
It has almost everything you want.

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.220
If it's beyond your imagination,

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220
If it's not on top of it,

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.220
You'll just have it on YouTube.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.220
It's going to be at the top.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.220
In this detail.

01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:10.220
Yeah.

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.220
Do you want to crop?

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.220
Basically.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.220
Then you press crop.

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:18.220
Then you just cut it.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.220
Apply.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.220
Okay, that's it.

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.220
Because it's an object now.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:43.220
If you want to put a star on it.

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.220
I want to dig a star.

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.220
I can do this.

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.220
Dig like this.

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.220
Got it.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.220
Let's go to the next question.

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.220
Okay.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.220
The next question is,

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:06.220
Can Illustrator add dots or lines to the pattern?

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.220
Yeah, that's a question.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.220
And then I just saw another one.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.220
A similar question.

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.220
Let's talk about it together.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.220
Okay.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.220
The other question is,

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.220
In the example of the chemical measuring bottle,

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:27.220
Is there a concept of scissors in Illustrator?

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.220
So you don't have to delete the dots one by one.

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.220
Just cut out the parts we don't want.

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.220
Oh, okay.

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.220
Yeah.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.220
Basically, it's delete.

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.220
Or backspace.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.220
That's the one on your shoulder.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:44.220
For example, we're back here now, right?

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.220
So what else can I do with this?

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.220
I just shortened that dot.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.220
I'm going to use a way to add dots.

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.220
To make this picture.

01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.220
This thing.

01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.220
I just didn't say that.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:03.220
If I just press this now.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.220
I'm going to edit the dots now.

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.220
So I'm going to change the oil to direct selection.

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.220
Then I can start to change the component.

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.220
I'll click on this object first.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.220
One, two, three, four, five.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.220
I see that there are so many dots now.

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.220
I don't want these three on top of me.

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.220
I'll take it off first.

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.220
I'll press delete.

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.220
I'm going to press the keyboard to delete or backspace.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.220
You can do this.

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.220
Or?

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:30.220
Sometimes your dots are very dense.

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.220
You might not be able to do that.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.220
It's so good, it's framed to your liking.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.220
At this time, you can.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.220
Uh, for example, you have to choose.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.220
You might be, uh.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.220
Okay, you press this.

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.220
Then you choose this.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.220
I'm going to choose a dot now, right?

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220
I'm going to press shift.

01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.220
Just don't put shift.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.220
I can start to choose more dots.

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.220
But because this is an image.

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.220
It's not, uh.

01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.220
It's not like a little painter or a photo.

01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.220
Uh, that, that.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.220
What's that? Photoshop.

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.220
Yeah, he didn't cut it.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:03.220
It's like cutting it off from the middle.

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.220
He didn't.

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.220
But he can do that.

01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:09.220
It's just that he has to go in.

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:14.220
Delete every dot and line of the image.

01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.220
Or you can, you can delete it together.

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:19.220
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a dot.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.220
How do I add it?

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.220
Because I'm now the problem is the dot.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.220
So I'm going to move the dot now.

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:26.220
You can see the left side of the toolbar.

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.220
There's one of these things in there.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.220
Okay.

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.220
Usually you see this.

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.220
This is the pen tool.

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.220
The pen tool, you press the right button.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:39.220
Or you, you just press this triangle.

01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:41.220
He's going to have four options.

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.220
The first one is to draw a dot.

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.220
I don't draw a line.

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.220
I don't draw a picture.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.220
I just draw a dot.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.220
For example, like this.

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.220
Okay, I'll just draw a dot.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:59.220
The second one is to add a dot.

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.220
The third one is to subtract a dot.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.220
The fourth one is to pull the handle.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.220
That's what I'm doing now, right?

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:06.220
But I want him to have a handle.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.220
I can use the fourth one to pull the handle.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:11.220
That's how you add a dot.

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.220
I'm going to add a dot here.

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.220
I'm going to add a dot here.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.220
Okay, that's it.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.220
So what am I doing now?

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.220
I'm going to use this shape to click on this.

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.220
Look at this.

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:27.220
I'm going to use this direct selection to see.

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.220
I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.220
There are two more dots here, right?

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.220
I'm going to be happy now.

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.220
Pick it up and delete it.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:40.220
That's it.

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.220
And then I can just put this over here.

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.220
I might want to cover this up.

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.220
I might want to cover this up.

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:49.220
Otherwise, it's a little weird.

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:54.220
I'm going to use this pen tool to cover this up.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.220
I'm going to cover this up.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.220
And then I'm going to put this over here.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:59.220
Sometimes when you delete a dot, the shape will be a little bit of a walk.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.220
This is the color scheme.

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:04.220
You might want to pay a little attention to it.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:09.220
I used some of the tricks yesterday.

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.220
I used some of the tricks yesterday.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.220
It's just that it's exactly the same.

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:20.220
If anyone wants to know later, we can share it.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:23.220
But this is how you increase the number of dots.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:24.220
You can also cut the dots.

01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.220
You can also cut the dots.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.220
You can also cut the dots.

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.220
You can also cut the dots.

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.220
You can also cut the dots.

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.220
And then I cut the dots.

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:33.220
I can also use this thing to pull the handle.

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.220
I don't like this dot.

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.220
I can press this.

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:43.220
I can press this.

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:48.220
I'm going to use this little thing.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:52.220
I'm going to use this little thing.

01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:58.220
And then I'm going to pull this handle.

01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:04.220
And then I'm going to pull this handle.

01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.220
Okay, look.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:12.220
It's a little heart.

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.220
Okay.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:17.220
And then the other question is,

01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:27.220
Did you also adjust the dots for the Neuroscientist picture in the first video?

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:40.220
Which one is the Neuroscientist picture?

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:45.220
Are you talking about this one?

01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:47.220
Yes, it should be.

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:48.220
It should be this one, right?

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:51.220
Okay.

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.220
This is a very good question.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:57.220
This picture is actually a little complicated, right?

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.220
He can use that dot.

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.220
If I made this picture,

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.220
I might pull a star first.

01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.220
And then let that star become, for example, an octagonal star.

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:13.220
And then I make each star round.

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:17.220
But because you know this line, you don't have to do it yourself.

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:20.220
I know it's going to take a lot of time to simulate this picture.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:23.220
Because I want to make sure that the curvature is exactly the same.

01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:25.220
But when you draw it yourself,

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:30.220
For example, I can draw a simple Neuroscientist for you now.

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.220
I'm like this.

01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:34.220
Okay.

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:37.220
And then I want this one to be, for example, it's curved.

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.220
Right?

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:43.220
Then I can make it curved.

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.220
This one is curved.

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.220
This one is curved like this.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.220
I drew it a little ugly.

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.220
I can make it curved.

01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:57.220
And then here.

01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.220
And then I might want it to be crooked.

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:03.220
Then I'll add two more dots.

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:07.220
For example, add a few more dots.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.220
And then I'll pull this dot out.

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:13.220
And then the dots are also curved.

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.220
This one is also curved.

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.220
Wait a minute. I'm going to break this one.

01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:26.220
This is also curved.

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.220
And then this one here is also curved.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.220
Okay.

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.220
Basically, you're just doing this kind of thing.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.220
You're just adjusting it slowly.

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:43.220
And then it's going to get better and better.

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.220
Okay.

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:49.220
It's easy to draw it up and then slowly draw it.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.220
You just want to draw it all the time.

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:55.220
But anyway, this is it.

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.220
This is it.

01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.220
You just add your own dots like this.

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.220
So what do we usually do?

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.220
There are two ways to do it.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.220
One is that you draw on the paper first.

01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:09.220
Draw a draft. It doesn't matter if it's ugly.

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:11.220
Put the paper down and stick it on.

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:13.220
And then when you're pulling the dots,

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.220
you stick it to the line you drew.

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.220
Pull it.

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.220
That way, it's going to be smooth.

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.220
It's not going to be that ugly.

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.220
The other way is if you have

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.220
an Adobe software.

01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:26.220
There's another software in Adobe.

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:28.220
It's called Adobe Capture.

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:30.220
It's basically...

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:34.220
I think Google has this feature, too.

01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:36.220
You type in NeuronCell.

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.220
And then it's going to have a vector neuron cell that someone else drew.

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.220
You can just pull in someone else's neuron cell.

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.220
And then modify it.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.220
For example, you just need a few more touches.

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.220
And then you can do this, too.

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:51.220
For example, I don't know if this one has it.

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.220
You can see that I'm doing AI right now.

01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.220
There's a neuron cell in the upper right corner, right?

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.220
You can search for someone else's neuron cell.

01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:04.220
Look, I have so many neuron cells.

01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:08.220
You might want to draw this one.

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.220
You might want to draw a simple two-dimensional picture.

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.220
Let's say you want to draw this one.

01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:16.220
This is generally...

01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:18.220
If you buy Adobe Stock, you can use it directly.

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.220
If you don't buy it,

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.220
you can screenshot it.

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.220
You can take a picture of it.

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.220
And then paste it in.

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.220
For example, like this.

01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.220
I can screenshot it.

01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:32.220
I'll take a picture, paste it in.

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.220
And then copy it and draw a similar one.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.220
I have a lot of...

01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.220
Here.

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:46.220
Here.

01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:52.220
I can paste this picture in.

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:54.220
And then put it at the end.

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:00.220
And then I can start.

01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:02.220
Just follow this picture.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.220
I can...

01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.220
Make this colorless.

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.220
And then start.

01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.220
Just start copying it.

01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:12.220
Okay.

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.220
Or I can even

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:16.220
add dots directly.

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.220
Okay.

01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:28.220
Why is this panel so short?

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:40.220
Okay.

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.220
Okay.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.220
Or I can

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:50.220
add dots directly.

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.220
For example,

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:54.220
I zoom in now, right?

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.220
And then I want...

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.220
You can see that I may need a dot here.

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:00.220
I may need a dot here.

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:02.220
I may need a dot here.

01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.220
I may need a dot here.

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.220
I can draw a skeleton

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:08.220
one by one.

01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:10.220
This may be easier than the stars.

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:12.220
Okay.

01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.220
The more dots you have, the more you have to adjust.

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.220
But of course it will look more real.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.220
Okay.

01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.220
Oh, I drew this badly.

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.220
You probably know what I mean.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.220
You can learn it one by one.

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:30.220
You can learn it one by one.

01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.220
Okay.

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:34.220
This is a pretty good example.

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:36.220
Okay.

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:38.220
And then we have some more questions.

01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.220
And then we have some more questions.

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.220
Is it...

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.220
Is it...

01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.220
Is it...

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.220
Is it...

01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.220
Is it...

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220
Is it...

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.220
Is it...

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220
Is it...

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.220
Is it...

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.220
Is it...

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.220
Is it...

01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:04.220
Is it...

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.220
Is it...

01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.220
Is it...

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.220
Is it...

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.220
okay.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.220
Okay.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:20.220
Okay.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:22.220
I actually have a case today.

01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.220
I'm going to talk about this.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.220
So I can use this picture.

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.220
I'll delete this picture first.

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.220
I'll delete this picture first.

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.220
Can you

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.220
Can you

01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.220
Can you

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:38.220
Can you

01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.220
Can you

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.220
Can you

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:44.220
Can you

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.220
Can you

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.220
Can you

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220
Can you

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.220
Can you

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.220
Can you

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.220
Can you

01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.220
Can you

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.220
Can you

01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:02.220
Can you

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:04.220
Can you

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.220
Can you

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.220
Can you

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.220
Can you

01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:12.220
Can you

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.220
Can you

01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:16.220
Thank you

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:17.260
Thank you

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.220
Thank you

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.220
Thank you

01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:22.220
Thank you

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.220
Thank you

01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.220
Thank you

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.220
Thank you

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:30.220
Thank you

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.220
Thank you

01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:34.220
Thank you

01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.220
Thank you

01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.220
Thank you

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.220
Thank you

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.220
Thank you

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:44.220
Thank you

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:48.220
Let's make a final size box

01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.220
This box

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.220
Let me adjust this box

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.220
The size of this box is

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.220
3.75 inches

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:02.220
Assuming this is 3.75 inches

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:08.220
This is my original picture

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.220
I'm going to put this original picture in

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.220
I'm going to put it in

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.220
I'm going to put it in

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:18.220
But you see I put it in

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.220
Don't you think this line is particularly fat?

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.220
And the word might be very small

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.220
Not the font you want

01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.220
This is a little bit of trouble

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:30.220
This is when I first told you

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.220
When you are sure to use the picture

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:34.220
The font you output directly to the software

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.220
It's best to be the last font you use

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.220
So you don't have to change it when you come in

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.220
Because for example, you output

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.220
For example, my picture

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.220
I'm from my Excel

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.220
After I output it from my Number

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.220
I didn't specify

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.220
my

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:52.220
The size of these letters

01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.220
I didn't specify the size

01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:56.220
So he might use something like 28, 32

01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.220
Very big

01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.220
And then when I put it on, it becomes very big

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:02.220
And when I shrink

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.220
It's just that it's a little bit deformed

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.220
It's a little weird

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:08.220
So when you output

01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.220
For example, your tick

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.220
All your numbers are 11

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.220
Then

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.220
Or 9

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.220
This is the best

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.220
So you don't have to change it here

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:22.220
It's very troublesome

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.220
What about the thickness of this line

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.220
You'd better set it first

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.220
If you can't set it, you can come here and change it

01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.220
I'll show you how to change it now

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.220
When you put the data in here

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.220
You don't want to make false data

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.220
So every time you shrink

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.220
There's a tool here

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.220
Take this

01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.220
Free Transform

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.220
Free Transform is

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.220
After you pick up some objects

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.220
You can use Free Transform

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:54.220
To shrink

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.220
You can shrink like this

01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.220
Or you can rotate

01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.220
When you use Free Transform

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.220
You must press Shift

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.220
So I'm going to write it down

01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:12.220
You have to press Shift when you shrink

01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.220
If you press Shift

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.220
The proportion of your length and width will be fixed

01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:18.220
So you don't make false

01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.220
The whole data is suddenly deformed

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.220
So you have to do this

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.220
After I do this

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.220
I'm going to come in and change the thickness of this data

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.220
How to change

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:30.220
At this time, I'm going to talk about

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:32.220
How does the general software process the layout?

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:34.220
You see, we're processing the layout in the AI

01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.220
All the things are dots

01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:38.220
The lines are connected, right?

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.220
It's very simple

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.220
It's like our kids are drawing

01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.220
But the general software is processing the layout

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.220
It's not like this

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:48.220
It's to make sure that every line or every layout

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.220
After the output

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.220
It's still the way it was

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.220
So every layout

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:56.220
Every line, every dot

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.220
Even every number, every icon

01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.220
We're going to use a thing called clipping mask

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.220
It's the protector

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.220
What is clipping mask?

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220
You must be doing powerpoint

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.220
There is

01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:16.220
Let me see

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.220
You must be doing powerpoint

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.220
There's something about it

01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.220
For example, I added a slide

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.220
OK

01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.220
You see, I'm in this slide

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220
Is there a picture on the left?

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:34.220
Is there a picture on the left of my slide?

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:36.220
If I want to change a picture

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:38.220
Do I pull in a picture?

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.220
You see, this picture is different from my original picture

01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:46.220
I had so many neurons in my original picture

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.220
My neurons are now cut off

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:50.220
What should I do?

01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.220
How did this happen?

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:54.220
The reason is because

01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:56.220
All the software

01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:58.220
It's to make sure

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.220
It's the same

01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:02.220
It's going to add a clipping mask

01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:04.220
I'm going to show you a clipping mask

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.220
Double this pattern

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.220
You see, there are two

01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.220
The first one is your original picture

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:12.220
This one

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:14.220
The second one is your mask

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.220
Your mask

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.220
You see, I'm going to show you a clipping mask

01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.220
The part that the mask frames

01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.220
It's the last thing that's going to show up

01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:26.220
OK

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.220
What about this idea?

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.220
This is our battle

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.220
Drawing is the biggest problem with modified timetable

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.220
Look at this

01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.220
This picture is just

01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.220
From

01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:40.220
Just let it go

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.220
Let's just look at this line

01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:44.220
This line

01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.220
When I choose this line now

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:48.220
I can't just choose this line

01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:50.220
Did you notice that I chose this whole thing

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.220
Because the mask of this line is so big

01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.220
I'm going to move this out now

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.220
Did you see

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.220
When I choose this line

01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:02.220
It's not these anchor points

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.220
It's not a line

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.220
But what does this mean

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:08.220
This doesn't mean that my data is so big

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:10.220
No, this means that my data is

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:12.220
It's just dots and lines

01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.220
It's just data

01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:16.220
This one outside is its mask

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:18.220
What can I do now?

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.220
I can double click now

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.220
I'm going to double click now

01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:24.220
This thing is what I'm going to do

01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.220
This is what we call Compound

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:28.220
OK

01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:30.220
I'm using the first arrow now

01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.220
I'm going to frame the whole big screen

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:36.220
Then you see

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:38.220
I framed this

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.220
Who is this

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:42.220
This is this line

01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:44.220
Then you see this line

01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.220
I moved it out of the clipping mask

01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:48.220
It was cut off

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.220
I don't know if you have this idea

01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:52.220
First of all, I'm going to move this over

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.220
OK

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.220
You see

01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.220
I have this thing

01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:10.220
This big mask

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:12.220
And then the data inside

01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.220
When I'm changing

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.220
I'm going to change the data inside

01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:18.220
So you usually have to point at the data you want to point at

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.220
And then dot dot dot dot

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.220
You see

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.220
I clicked a few more times

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:26.220
I finally clicked into this one

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.220
You see if I can see it now

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.220
I zoom in and see if I can see it now

01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:32.220
Circle circle

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:34.220
This is the image

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.220
I finally got this data

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:38.220
I can choose this circle now

01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.220
Then you can choose this line

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.220
Sometimes you have to click a few more times

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.220
Very troublesome

01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:46.220
Then I can put this stroke now

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:48.220
Become more

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.220
Become thinner

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:56.220
For example, I use 1.75

01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:58.220
I like to use 1.75 the most

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:02.220
Then these circles are the same

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.220
You are the same

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.220
You don't want it to be so thick

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.220
So you have to go in and choose

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:10.220
Click a few more times to choose this circle

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:14.220
Then become 1.75

01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:16.220
Change one by one

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:18.220
You see this is actually very troublesome

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.220
How do I do this efficiently?

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.220
We may want to take this mask

01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:28.220
I just choose this thing first

01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:30.220
Then I'm going to pick up this object

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.220
Right click

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.220
Then press this

01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:36.220
I'm going to take this mask off

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.220
Take it off

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:40.220
OK, now this thing

01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.220
After I re-frame it

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:44.220
You see, it's completely

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:46.220
These groups of circles and lines

01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.220
I want to change this thing

01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.220
It's easier

01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.220
I can do this

01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:00.220
Then it will wash

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.220
I just moved it out

01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:04.220
Don't do it when you are doing your own data

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:06.220
This is ugly

01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.220
There is a risk of fake data

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.220
I just want to make it easy for you to see the mask

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:12.220
So I just moved it out

01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:14.220
Actually, when you are operating

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.220
You usually do this

01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.220
You just choose this

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.220
After choosing this thing

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:22.220
You just choose your object

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:24.220
Move a little bit first

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:26.220
Make sure you get it

01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.220
Then press ctrl-z

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.220
Right click, release this mask

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.220
When I release the mask

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.220
I originally chose an object

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.220
You see, there are two boxes

01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:38.220
One is my data line box

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.220
The other is the mask box

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.220
Now you can put this mask box

01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:44.220
You can also choose this mask box

01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.220
Delete it

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.220
I think I chose the wrong one

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.220
Wait a minute

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.220
These two

01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.220
Then I choose this

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:02.220
Delete

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.220
Now this box is gone

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.220
I can choose the data I want

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.220
Change its appearance

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:12.220
Like this

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.220
The most annoying part of AI

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:18.220
Just look at each of these

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.220
Just this bar

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.220
Look at our bar

01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:24.220
This bar

01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.220
It's not like a text

01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:30.220
When you enter the text

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:32.220
Choose the bottom line of the text

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.220
It means it's a text

01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:36.220
But when you enter

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.220
That bar

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:40.220
It becomes an object

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:42.220
It doesn't have that line

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:44.220
And it doesn't have a lot of dots

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:46.220
So it means this thing

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.220
It's also protected by the mask

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.220
Just press the right button

01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.220
Ok

01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:54.220
Sorry

01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.220
And then the same thing

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.220
Cut off the outline of this bar

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.220
So you can choose

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.220
So when all the software

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.220
Enter Illustrator to draw

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.220
The most annoying thing is

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:12.220
You have to put every little thing

01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:14.220
The clipping mask is all released

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.220
And then delete those masks

01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.220
Delete those masks

01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:20.220
And then edit it

01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.220
And then after this thing

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.220
There's something important

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:30.220
A lot of people didn't notice

01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.220
I want to talk about

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.220
After you enter the number

01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:36.220
You might have the size

01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:38.220
And then you have to output

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:40.220
And then you have the font

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.220
And then you output

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:44.220
And then your picture

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:46.220
After using another computer

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:48.220
I found that the font

01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:50.220
I can't find it

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:52.220
But the font is ugly

01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:54.220
What should I do

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.220
This is a very common problem

01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.220
Your computer font

01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:00.220
Windows font

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:02.220
Mac font

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:04.220
There's a problem when you switch

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.220
So the best way at this time

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.220
You type all the words

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.220
For example, this bar

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:12.220
I have a number

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:14.220
After I type it

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:16.220
You circle all these words

01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.220
Right click

01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:20.220
Then click Create Outline

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.220
I'll zoom in for you

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:26.220
This bar is just a bar

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:28.220
It's a text

01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:30.220
After I create it

01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.220
It's not a text

01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.220
I'm using this A

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.220
Look at this picture

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.220
It's not a text anymore

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:42.220
It's a lot of dots

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:44.220
Look at this picture

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:46.220
It's already a text

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.220
When you output it on a different computer

01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.220
There will be no font

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.220
Unreadable problem

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:04.220
Understand

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:06.220
And then the audience

01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.220
Someone said

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:10.220
That is

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.220
You can see more clearly

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.220
Masks and objects

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:16.220
Layer management

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:18.220
Yes, there is a layer management

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:20.220
There is a layer management

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:22.220
You can

01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:24.220
You put everything on different layers

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:26.220
You can see the objects

01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:30.220
But I rarely use this

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220
I personally rarely use this feature

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:34.220
I don't remember

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:36.220
How to set up layers

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:38.220
But if you're interested

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.220
There are a lot of layers

01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.220
I suggest you

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.220
Go to YouTube

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.220
Lastly

01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:52.220
I'll end the meeting here

01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.220
But we can continue

01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:56.220
To ask questions

01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.220
I'll bother the teacher

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.220
Until she can't

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.220
Because there are too many questions

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:06.220
If I can't, I'll

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:08.220
That's all

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:10.220
Bye
