WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Good morning, good evening, and thank you for joining me today to share my screen.

00:11.000 --> 00:27.000
We don't have a lot of people today, so feel free to interrupt me at any time if you have any questions, or just turn on the microphone.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
The topic I'm going to talk about today is called Invisible Risk Data Sharing Activities of Data Brokers.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
My co-authors are Aaron, who just got his PhD from Rutgers.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
His PhD peers are also here.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
He's going to go to California State University, Fullerton.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
The other teacher is a Rutgers teacher.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Let me introduce myself.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
My background is actually accounting.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm a CPA, and I'm a Certified Internal Auditor.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
But my PhD is Management Information Systems.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I usually teach data analytics and data mining related courses.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Because of my background.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm currently on the list of Fulbright specialists.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I specialize in curriculum development.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
I've worked with Computer Science before.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
They have a task force on how to design cybersecurity curriculum.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
So I'm in that program.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
My research is mainly IT management and security management.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Almost all of them are in this area.

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
I often give lectures outside, maybe at universities, conferences, or some professional organizations.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
I used to be a panelist at the Federal Reserve Bank.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
About three or four weeks ago,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I helped them do analytics training at McDonald's.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I also did some training for the California Department of Justice.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
I also gave a lecture at the Taiwan Monetary Authority.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
In 2018, I was at KPMG, a large audit consulting firm.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I was a professor-in-residence there.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So I worked with them in New York for 10 weeks.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I also do projects with them.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
I've done more than 15 projects so far.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm the incoming president of Accounting Information Systems.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
This is my LinkedIn.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
If you're interested.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
About this paper.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Data Broker has been around for a long time.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's just that it's been noticed for the past 10 years.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
As you can see, a lot of news is about Data Brokers.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
The earliest one I have here is from 2013.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I've been seeing it since this year.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Especially after the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
More news.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Who is a Data Broker?

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
A Data Broker is not the organization we usually come into contact with.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
For example, if we go to a website.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
We all know that it collects a lot of our information.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
We also know that some websites will sell or share our information.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
But the Data Broker is actually hiding behind these websites.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So when it's collecting data, we probably don't know.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
For example, we have a free app on our phone.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Then we log in.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
In fact, this app is free.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It's not free.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
It's actually because there's an additional information sharing action behind it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
So it's free.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Or, for example, we go to the supermarket to buy something.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
All of our purchase records and so on.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
In fact, it's all shared behind it.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Or it can go to, for example, Facebook.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
All of our public information on Instagram.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
So the photos we posted.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
What we wrote.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
How to write.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Is it a relationship?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It knows all of these things.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
There are also some public sources that it can find.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
For example, in Illinois.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
For example, who paid for which house's property tax.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That's all you can see.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
So there's actually public registration information.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And then these companies will collect all of your data.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And if it's not enough, it will go to other Data Brokers.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Share it together or buy it from them.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And after you've bought it, you've sorted it out.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
In fact, each of us will have a tag.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
It can have some influence.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
For example, this person is their family.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
There will be a baby recently.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Or this person will have access to a golf club.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Or this person is Facebook's social media influencer.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
It can all know that you have some preferences.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Or you have some characteristics.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
It knows it all.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And this is the most common thing.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
These marketing or advertising Data Brokers.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
They can actually do it very accurately.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
For example, when I was in another school.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
My colleague, every time he received an advertisement letter, he asked him.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Do you want to buy a house?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Do you want to buy a new car?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Do you want to buy a new boat?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And then he got this.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I got it all.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Do you want to borrow Personal Loan?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Do you want to borrow Mortgage?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
How much money do you still have to pay for Mortgage?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So you can see that he can know.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
What is your current financial situation?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The advertisement he gave you.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's all different.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
There are also two more common ones.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Fraud Detection and Risk Mitigation.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
For example, when you go to the bank to borrow money.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
He needs to make sure that the information you give is correct.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It is also through Data Brokers.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
This part is very important.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
There are also some websites that actually allow you to find other people's websites.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
He also collects the information of these people through Data Brokers.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
So you can judge if that person is the one you want to see.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
So why is this information useful?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
That's actually because if he can get a lot of customer data.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Collect it all.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
And then whether it's online or offline.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
What happens after he finds it all?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Then he has a way to reconfirm these data.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
For example, the same thing.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I went to find it from a lot of sources.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I can tell which one is right.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Then you can put that data quality will be much better.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So he has a way to use it to make some predictions.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Then he doesn't care what happens to each of us.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
What he wants is this large amount of aggregated data.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Then he can make predictions for him.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
After this prediction, it's actually very useful.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's because he can sell it.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
For example, this person may have to change cars next year.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
He has a way to tell these people.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
You can send a marketing material.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Or he can buy more useful information from other Data Brokers.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
To make his data richer.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
So you will see all kinds of Data Brokers.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
These four are relatively large.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
For example, Axiom is actually very large.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
They are all doing marketing campaigns and fraud detection.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Then the three people in the back are for business or government.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
For example, tell you what the financial information of these people is.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Or someone told you that his customer transaction.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
What does it look like?

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Or he can tell you that I have collected this information.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Not just for marketing.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Financial service products can be given.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
In fact, this is when you understand all the profiles of a person.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
In fact, all the information is very useful.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So what kind of information did they collect?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Uh, this is a bit vague.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Because this is a screenshot.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
But if you can see, he actually tells you here.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Axiom is a big Data Broker.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
He is a Public Traded Company.

08:01.000 --> 08:09.000
He has 45 years of historical data on name changes and residential history.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
He has all the data from the past 45 years.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Who are you here?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
How did you change your name?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
He has it all.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
That gender, age, education level.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
This is very simple for them.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
He also knows you.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
For example, what income level do you currently have?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
What is the car?

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Then when there is this information, he can do prediction.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
For example, is there anyone in your household?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Recently planning to have a baby.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Or is it planning to adopt a child?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Or are you in the United States every year?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Are you paying taxes every April?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Or are you a heavy Facebook user?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Or are you easily influenced by social media?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
He has a way to know.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Do you have major medical insurance?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
All of these are known.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
Then, surprisingly, they have more than 3000 different attributes.

09:03.000 --> 09:12.000
So in the United States, everyone, if he has collected your information, he has 3000 different attributes to describe the various characteristics of this person.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
So he actually knows very well what happened to each of us.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Sometimes we don't even know our own preference.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
But these data brokers will know.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Then you will find that this is actually quite scary.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
The reason is because he is not the organization we will directly contact.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
For example, we go to Amazon.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
We know Amazon.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
We go to Facebook.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
We know it's him.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
But he's actually doing these things behind the scenes.

09:40.000 --> 09:49.000
So in 2014, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, they actually have two articles.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
They're all talking about this.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
What they're talking about in these two articles is actually that they're talking about data brokers.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Their biggest problem is that we don't know what he's doing.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
We don't know what information he's collecting.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
We don't know what he's doing with our information.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
How to share it, how to sell it, who to sell it to.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
In fact, we all don't know that his whole practice is actually a black box.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So we don't know what they're doing at all.

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
So this Federal Trade Commission in 2013 and 2014, we hope that everyone can have some action to limit that.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
At least let us know more about what these data brokers are doing.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
So this is the main content of these two articles.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
So what they're talking about is a very interesting thing, which is data brokers.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
They're actually competing with each other to see who they can sell their data to.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So there's no problem.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But they're not actually competing with each other.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
They're actually cooperating with each other.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
For example, they asked nine data brokers.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
And then they'll know where each data broker comes from.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
For example, you're collecting public data from government agencies.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Or it could be any other publicly available source.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
But it could be commercial sources.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Or it could be collected from another company and given to you.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
You'll see that these nine data brokers actually have very different ways of collecting data.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Some people only use commercial sources.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Some people use everything.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
And the most special thing is that although they're usually competing for clients,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
that is, who can buy their data,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
but you can see that their data is actually shared with each other.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Or you can say, ah, I've collected this data today.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And then if you need it, I'll sell it to you.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
So you can see that they're a very complex network.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And in these nine, there are actually only seven,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
which is the one on the bottom left.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
The seventh is that it has nothing to do with other data brokers.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
There are no data sharing activities.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
Everyone else will buy or sell to a certain extent.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Or where do you share it from?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
They all have it.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
This thing is very interesting to us.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
The reason is because if they don't just collect it themselves,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
they'll take other people's stuff and use it together.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
If today the hacker can attack a certain data broker,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
it's actually like a grand prize.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
The reason is because the data you get is not just his.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
All the information you get and all the other people,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
all the information they share with each other.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That's actually our hypothesis.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
It's just that we later found out that there really was this thing.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
For example, many years ago, in 2018,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Equifax had a big breach.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
They forgot to update their software inside,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
so they had a big breach.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Their breach is actually not just Equifax's data being leaked.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
In addition to Equifax,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
the other two big credit bureaus,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
which is Experian and TransUnion,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
are actually all leaked.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
In fact, our data collection is from Dark Web.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
So we actually found that

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
if you go and find Equifax's data breach,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
you can actually see the data of the other two.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
It's actually all mixed up.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
There's also some anecdotal evidence.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
When Equifax had a breach,

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
the other two reported the credit fraud data.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
So all the data is actually leaked.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
If we go to, for example, Google Trend,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
and look at their fraud report trend,

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
you'll find that these three are actually almost the same trend.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
One company has a problem,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
and the other two have a problem.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
We think that this is definitely because

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
of the influence of the exchange of information between them.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
So as long as one person has a problem,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
everything will happen.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
That's a lot of trouble.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So you'll see that in fact,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
there are a lot of regulations in the United States.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
They've been around since 2013.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
The early focus was actually that

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
these data brokers should let those consumers know

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
what kind of data they've collected.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So in 2013 and 2014,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Axiom would actually let every user,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
no matter who you are,

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
you go and log into your data,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and then you can see what information you have.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You can see it all.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
There are also some other points that

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
they feel are not transparent at all.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
What is your practice?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
What did you collect?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Who did you sell it to?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So far, it's all black box.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This is early 2013 and 2014.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And then in 2018 and 2019,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
there were two new things.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
In Vermont,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
there's a data broker law.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It says,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
if you're a data broker,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
we'll talk about its definition later.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
If you're a data broker,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
you should register with its Secretary of State.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
To register,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
simply put,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
before the end of January every year,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
you have to go to its website

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
and provide all your data to it.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
The provided data actually looks like this.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Which company are you from?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
What is your website?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
And then if the user doesn't want you to collect information,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
can you opt out?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I don't want you to collect.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
So how do you do it?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It actually has all the details of the disclosure.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Or it says,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
do you have any

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
statement about opt-out

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
or data collection?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
You can actually write it up.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
This example is written a lot.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Some companies,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
although it says it's registered,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
but in fact,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
you'll see that there's no information at all.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
A lot of them just say,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
please see our website.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
If you click on it,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
there's nothing there.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
You can hardly see it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
This is one.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
The second question is actually

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
data broker,

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
even if it meets the definition of regulation,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
it's a data broker.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
If it doesn't register,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
the penalty is actually very low.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I forgot if it's Vermont or California State.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
If you don't register,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
you'll only be fined $100 a day.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And it's online.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I've been fined,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
for example,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
$10,000,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
and I can't pay anymore.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
For data brokers,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
this is almost nothing.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
They might make more than $10,000 a day.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
So,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
uh,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
the penalty is actually not that big.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
It's not like GDPR,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
which has such a big impact on European privacy regulation.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
If you have a violation,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
it's just a few percent annual sales revenue.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
So,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
the effect of this thing is not that good.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
it's actually very simple to define.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Simply put,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
when a company,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
you know you're collecting data,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
or you know you're selling it,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
you take the data you've collected and sell it.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And then it's actually a data broker.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
As long as you collect the data and sell the data,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
you're not directly facing those customers,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
it's actually a data broker.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
So,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
uh,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
it's actually a pretty big definition.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
But actually,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
you have to think about this definition.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
It's very simple.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
For example,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
if you only collect data,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
buy the data and use it yourself,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
you're not a data broker.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Or,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
say,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
the data you collect is actually your customer's data.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
For example,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Amazon,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
what I collect is actually the data of these people who buy things from me.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
And then I take these things and sell them.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Actually,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm not a data broker.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
So,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
there's actually a loophole.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
So,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
that's going to cause some problems.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
A lot of companies are actually data brokers,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
because they're actually doing business.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
But,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
uh,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
according to this law,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
you can't actually see it.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
The California State is the same.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Uh,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
that is,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
if you go to his Attorney General's office,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
you can also see this big,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
uh,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
almost all the requests are exactly the same.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It's just that it started working a year later.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
It started working in January 2020.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
All the definitions are the same.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Almost everything is the same.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Although,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
uh,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
California's privacy regulation is actually more strict.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But it's actually the same in this regard.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
So,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
the information he's going to reveal is actually almost the same.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
So,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
uh,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
if you don't have a chance to go to their website,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
you can see something like that.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
So,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
uh,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
let's talk about it very quickly.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Uh,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
we think,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
why do they compete with each other and cooperate with each other?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Why do you think this is going to happen to them in the future?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Security breach or,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
or,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
or information will,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
will,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
will be stolen by someone.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
This state is actually related to the reason.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
The first big point is actually not in this.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Competition or data sharing.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
It's actually because it's actually an unregulated industry.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
He said,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
he said,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
everything is actually self-regulated.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
They have their own privacy standards.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
They have their own norms.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
But,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
uh,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
for us,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
in fact,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
they are unregulated.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
That is.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
You take your information and share it.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Uh,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
what is your penalty?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Or,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
what can be shared?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
What can't be shared?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
In fact,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
there are no restrictions at all.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Simply put.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
So,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
if there is a hacker.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
If you can find a data broker,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
if you can take all his information,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
the impact will be great.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
So,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
this is why,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
like Equifax,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
the main one.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
In fact,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
the main one is a data broker.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
If there is a breach,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
it will have a great impact.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
These information can actually be sold.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
So,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
that will have a greater impact.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
So,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
there are more benefits.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
So,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
people are more likely to want to go,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
uh,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
get your information and sell it.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
So,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
this paper is still in a very rough stage.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
But I think,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
uh,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
we still hope to be able to present.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And then I hope to give you some awareness.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Or,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
uh,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
some extra ideas.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Especially in,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
uh,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
how to protect privacy protection.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Or,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
how to be more,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
more effective to understand what they are doing.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
So,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
uh,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
you will see that in fact,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
our hypothesis,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
in fact,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
everything is still in a very rough stage.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
So,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
but we still hope to be able to share more.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
So,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
the other one is,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
uh,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
we want to know if this registration has any impact.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Uh,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
we,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
of course,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
we let these broad data brokers,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
they are all transparent.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Or,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
everyone knows who they are.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Will they say,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
their practice is better?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
They are more transparent.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Or,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
they have some pressure to say,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
they can't be so easy.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
There will be a security breach.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
But the problem is actually in,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
not this regulation.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
In fact,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
because even if you don't register,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
it doesn't actually work.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
So,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
uh,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I think,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
uh,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I think,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
uh,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I think,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
uh,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
uh.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
So,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
uh,

so.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Uh,

35:05.020 --> 35:06.020
Conclusion.

35:08.020 --> 35:10.020
This research is actually very rough.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.020
That's actually an ongoing project.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.020
Actually, we've always wanted to keep going.

35:14.020 --> 35:18.020
The focus of our presentation today is actually that we want to

35:18.020 --> 35:21.020
improve everyone's awareness of data brokers.

35:21.020 --> 35:24.020
Or I hope to encourage everyone to say that if you are interested,

35:24.020 --> 35:26.020
you can join this project.

35:26.020 --> 35:30.020
So we can think about how we can do it.

35:30.020 --> 35:34.020
Uh, more accurately or more effectively.

35:35.020 --> 35:36.020
Data collection.

35:37.020 --> 35:38.020
Sharing the practices.

35:43.020 --> 35:44.020
Privacy protection.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.020

35:57.020 --> 35:58.020

35:58.020 --> 35:59.020

36:05.020 --> 36:06.020
Transparency.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.020
Transparency.

36:18.020 --> 36:19.020
Talk.

36:24.020 --> 36:25.020
Stop sharing.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.020
No problem.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.020
Very clear.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.020
I just want to think about it.

36:51.020 --> 36:56.020
I don't know much about this, but I think it's a very important issue.

36:56.020 --> 36:59.020
I want to share with you.

37:00.020 --> 37:03.020
How do you protect your own data?

37:03.020 --> 37:06.020
For example, because every website you use now has cookies.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.020
Then you have to accept or reject.

37:08.020 --> 37:11.020
Then there's something we can do to protect it.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
Or it's already too late.

37:13.020 --> 37:16.020
Our profile is already known to everyone.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.020
We found that most of the data is already out there.

37:19.020 --> 37:21.020
So we have to protect it.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.020
We have to protect it.

37:23.020 --> 37:25.020
We have to protect it.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.020
We have to protect it.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.020
So most of the data is already out there.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.020
And then I'm trying something now.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.020
It's a cookie on the website.

37:34.020 --> 37:37.020
For example, I'm connected to Wall Street Journal today.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.020
I'm connected to Amazon today.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.020
What's behind it?

37:39.020 --> 37:42.020
Collecting our data or activity.

37:42.020 --> 37:45.020
Uh, we found that actually.

37:45.020 --> 37:48.020
I can't control it in the middle of an upper bound and lower bound.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.020
Upper bound is to say.

37:50.020 --> 37:52.020
Uh, I'm Google today.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
In the situation of signing in.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.020
So Chrome knows who I am.

37:56.020 --> 37:58.020
In that case,

37:58.020 --> 38:00.020
In fact, they collect a lot of data.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.020
It's pretty amazing.

38:02.020 --> 38:05.020
But if I'm not logged in at all.

38:05.020 --> 38:08.020
My browser is open again in private mode.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
That can be limited to the amount.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020
It's a lot worse.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.020
So that's another way.

38:13.020 --> 38:15.020
Just try to close it.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.020
No way.

38:16.020 --> 38:19.020
There are some cookies that are actually more troublesome.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.020
Uh.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.020
Although he told you,

38:22.020 --> 38:23.020
Do you want to accept it?

38:23.020 --> 38:25.020
But in fact, whether you accept it or not.

38:25.020 --> 38:26.020
That's the way it is.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
You can't see any effect.

38:28.020 --> 38:31.020
There are some websites that can make you willing to let you choose.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.020
Uh, different cookies.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.020
At that time, there was.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.020
But some of them can't be turned off.

38:35.020 --> 38:37.020
Because he has to know who you are.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.020
Otherwise, you can't browse the website.

38:39.020 --> 38:41.020
Yeah, so, uh.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.020
There are still some restrictions.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.020
Yeah, but, uh.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.020
You'll know that they've actually collected a lot of data.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.020
In fact, you probably know who we are.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.020
What are we doing?

38:50.020 --> 38:52.020
Um.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.020
Yeah, that's terrible.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
Yeah, well, uh.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.020
I have another one with a computer science.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.020
Before doing it.

38:59.020 --> 39:02.020
We can actually use it.

39:02.020 --> 39:05.020
Posts on social media.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.020
We have a way to predict, uh.

39:07.020 --> 39:10.020
Buying clothes or buying accessories.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.020
Preference.

39:11.020 --> 39:13.020
And then there's that.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.020
We can know that.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.020
What kind of clothes do you like to wear next season?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.020
Color, brand.

39:17.020 --> 39:21.020
And that prediction accuracy rate is probably over 90%.

39:21.020 --> 39:24.020
That, uh, that's a lot of trouble.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.020
It's just that we do it ourselves.

39:25.020 --> 39:26.020
It's just that we collect it ourselves.

39:26.020 --> 39:27.020
We have a very small part of the data.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.020
We can do it so well.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.020
You can tell that they're going to do it.

39:30.020 --> 39:33.020
It's actually easier.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.020
Then you would think.

39:35.020 --> 39:38.020
Try not to post your own.

39:38.020 --> 39:40.020
Too many personal things.

39:40.020 --> 39:42.020
Or preferences or something.

39:42.020 --> 39:43.020
But I think.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.020
We still have a question.

39:45.020 --> 39:46.020
I think so.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.020
This is a preference.

39:48.020 --> 39:49.020
Uh.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.020
Uh, if we don't share this information.

39:51.020 --> 39:55.020
We can't have those customized services.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.020
Our search will be very bad.

39:57.020 --> 39:59.020
Uh, it's almost not what you want.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.020
Yeah, so if we want.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.020
You can't do anything about the specific service.

40:03.020 --> 40:04.020
You have to write, right?

40:04.020 --> 40:06.020
But this is actually a preference.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.020
So I'm talking about what they said to Google before.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.020
That's more accurate.

40:10.020 --> 40:12.020
What is your privacy?

40:12.020 --> 40:14.020
It's your own decision.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.020
It's actually from 0 to 100.

40:15.020 --> 40:17.020
How much do I want to share?

40:17.020 --> 40:19.020
It depends on what you like.

40:19.020 --> 40:21.020
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

40:21.020 --> 40:23.020
Then we have a question.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.020
Uh.

40:25.020 --> 40:27.020
You are me.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.020
My name is Chen Peiying.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.020
I am now at Indiana University.

40:31.020 --> 40:33.020
Read information science.

40:33.020 --> 40:35.020
Although I don't do data privacy related issues.

40:35.020 --> 40:37.020
But because this is very popular now.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.020
So I just wanted to say.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.020
Let's listen to the speech.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.020
I think there are a lot of gains.

40:42.020 --> 40:44.020
Especially this kind of data broker role.

40:44.020 --> 40:46.020
At least in our field.

40:46.020 --> 40:48.020
This kind of investment information related area.

40:48.020 --> 40:50.020
In fact, it is less mentioned.

40:50.020 --> 40:52.020
Everyone is basically targeting a single website.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.020
This kind of.

40:54.020 --> 40:56.020
Uh.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.020
Data privacy is being discussed.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.020
So my question is, since this is a data broker.

41:00.020 --> 41:02.020
Um.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.020
How do you say they are very critical?

41:04.020 --> 41:06.020
They have so much data on their hands.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.020
Why would they let their own data so easily?

41:08.020 --> 41:10.020
Give it out.

41:10.020 --> 41:12.020
Just their own privacy.

41:12.020 --> 41:14.020
Their own privacy.

41:14.020 --> 41:16.020
Their data security.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.020
And because once they are leaked.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.020
Just assume that I am a.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.020
I have that data set.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.020
But I was harmed.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.020
This information is somehow.

41:26.020 --> 41:28.020
It is available on the website.

41:28.020 --> 41:30.020
Yeah.

41:30.020 --> 41:32.020
Isn't he supposed to prevent this from happening?

41:32.020 --> 41:34.020
Yeah.

41:34.020 --> 41:36.020
So we think it's very.

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
This is the weirdest thing we think.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.020
And you see there are so many competitors.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.020
To say that this is actually a very.

41:42.020 --> 41:44.020
Profitable business.

41:44.020 --> 41:46.020
So there will be thousands of companies.

41:46.020 --> 41:48.020
In fact, doing this kind of thing.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.020
But their information is.

41:50.020 --> 41:52.020
Everyone has it.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.020
But he can still continue to sell.

41:54.020 --> 41:56.020
So why do we want to know more?

41:56.020 --> 41:58.020
What are they doing?

41:58.020 --> 42:00.020
And what happened?

42:00.020 --> 42:02.020
But the problem is that they are actually hidden players.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
That is.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.020
They don't even know who they are.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
Or the company name.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.020
It doesn't make sense.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.020
It's like a mess.

42:12.020 --> 42:14.020
It's like we're talking about it in class.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.020
So I can't find them at all.

42:16.020 --> 42:18.020
So if there are more people.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.020
You can jump in and find a way to know.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.020
Who are they?

42:22.020 --> 42:24.020
What are they doing?

42:24.020 --> 42:26.020
That would be very helpful.

42:26.020 --> 42:28.020
We would love to know.

42:28.020 --> 42:30.020
Because.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.020
That will have a lot of impact.

42:32.020 --> 42:34.020
Because, for example, Amazon or Google.

42:34.020 --> 42:36.020
They are actually sitting on a mountain of data.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.020
So if we can find their security.

42:38.020 --> 42:40.020
It would be very useful.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
Like Amazon, he actually.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.020
He put his report.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.020
It's their information system.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.020
The audit report of security control.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.020
It's all shared on the website.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.020
They are very confident that we are very good.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
But these people are actually.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.020
It's completely blank.

42:58.020 --> 43:00.020
For example, since they have registered.

43:00.020 --> 43:02.020
And then, although there is no URL.

43:02.020 --> 43:04.020
Will they at least provide one?

43:04.020 --> 43:06.020
Like a physical address.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.020
That is to say, my company is definitely open.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.020
In a place like this.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.020
They have a physical address.

43:12.020 --> 43:14.020
Like a registered address and a phone number.

43:14.020 --> 43:16.020
Is there any more.

43:16.020 --> 43:18.020
Is there a clear geographical distribution?

43:18.020 --> 43:20.020
Or is it actually.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.020
I don't think so.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.020
We can't see any.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.020
Specific phenomenon.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.020
Because they collect data.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.020
In fact, there is no limit to a specific.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.020
State or something.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.020
Because for example.

43:34.020 --> 43:36.020
Because after all, you can pass it on.

43:36.020 --> 43:38.020
To another server.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.020
Because I know they will have some distribution.

43:40.020 --> 43:42.020
For example, I need this.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.020
I remember it seems to be Google and Amazon.

43:44.020 --> 43:46.020
They have to find that kind of resource.

43:46.020 --> 43:48.020
All kinds of natural resources.

43:48.020 --> 43:50.020
Very rich place.

43:50.020 --> 43:52.020
I want to have enough electricity and water.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.020
I want to make sure he has a power outage.

43:54.020 --> 43:56.020
Very warm.

43:56.020 --> 43:58.020
But these things are actually.

43:58.020 --> 44:00.020
It's not a company.

44:00.020 --> 44:02.020
It's not their physical address.

44:02.020 --> 44:04.020
Must be.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.020
Not necessarily related.

44:06.020 --> 44:08.020
Their company may be very small.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.020
Because they are actually not sitting in the office at all.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.020
Those people.

44:12.020 --> 44:14.020
That's right.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.020
I was talking about this before.

44:16.020 --> 44:18.020
Someone said that we have no way to know.

44:18.020 --> 44:20.020
Who is the European data broker?

44:20.020 --> 44:22.020
Because of the GDPR.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.020
The privacy law.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.020
His control should be stricter.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.020
So if we can find them.

44:28.020 --> 44:30.020
Maybe they have more information.

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
It's easier to know what they're doing.

44:32.020 --> 44:34.020
But I still don't know.

44:34.020 --> 44:36.020
That's our data source.

44:36.020 --> 44:38.020
Where to find it.

44:38.020 --> 44:40.020
In fact, we don't know yet.

44:40.020 --> 44:42.020
So this is interesting.

44:42.020 --> 44:44.020
We think this is really like research.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.020
I don't know what I'm doing.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.020
I think it's a very interesting relationship.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.020
Because like you said.

44:52.020 --> 44:54.020
It's a school hire.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
He's still looking for these companies.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.020
He's using your background.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.020
To make a background check.

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
So I think there's some information hidden in it.

45:02.020 --> 45:04.020
It's not right.

45:04.020 --> 45:06.020
You said the school information office.

45:06.020 --> 45:08.020
Why don't you find someone to find it directly?

45:08.020 --> 45:10.020
Maybe you can find it.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.020
But it may be based on various cost considerations.

45:12.020 --> 45:14.020
We just have to sell your information to these companies.

45:14.020 --> 45:16.020
So there is a.

45:16.020 --> 45:18.020
There is no mutual benefit.

45:18.020 --> 45:20.020
But I think there is a relationship between the two.

45:20.020 --> 45:22.020
Why are these people.

45:22.020 --> 45:24.020
Although we think they are doing something.

45:24.020 --> 45:26.020
But in fact.

45:26.020 --> 45:28.020
You probably.

45:28.020 --> 45:30.020
Because it's a school.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.020
He still relies on.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.020
Relying on these brokers.

45:34.020 --> 45:36.020
To provide some information.

45:36.020 --> 45:38.020
That's like a financial institution.

45:38.020 --> 45:40.020
We go to apply.

45:40.020 --> 45:42.020
For example, mortgages.

45:42.020 --> 45:44.020
He is also exchanging information with these people.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.020
To confirm our.

45:46.020 --> 45:48.020
Are we giving the right thing?

45:48.020 --> 45:50.020
It's just that this side is more compliant.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.020
This side is more highly regulated.

45:52.020 --> 45:54.020
For example, there is something called.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.020
Fair Credit Act.

45:56.020 --> 45:58.020
Something like this.

45:58.020 --> 46:00.020
We can review our credit score.

46:00.020 --> 46:02.020
In case something is wrong, we can ask him to change it.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.020
There is.

46:04.020 --> 46:06.020
But like other data brokers.

46:06.020 --> 46:08.020
If his information is wrong.

46:08.020 --> 46:10.020
In fact, we don't know where his information is wrong.

46:10.020 --> 46:12.020
Or where is it wrong?

46:12.020 --> 46:14.020
If people use this to verify.

46:14.020 --> 46:16.020
Who are we?

46:16.020 --> 46:18.020
In case it's all different.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.020
Then the problem is big.

46:20.020 --> 46:22.020
Another question is.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.020
There are so many competitors.

46:24.020 --> 46:26.020
Their niche.

46:26.020 --> 46:28.020
What is their selling point?

46:28.020 --> 46:30.020
I can only think of it now.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.020
It's just that you use some wrong information.

46:32.020 --> 46:34.020
To earn that kind of benefit.

46:34.020 --> 46:36.020
Because if I know there is a company.

46:36.020 --> 46:38.020
Can provide more.

46:38.020 --> 46:40.020
What is the so-called more accurate?

46:40.020 --> 46:42.020
How to define it?

46:42.020 --> 46:44.020
Right.

46:44.020 --> 46:46.020
Or whose model is better?

46:46.020 --> 46:48.020
Or who has it?

46:48.020 --> 46:50.020
But there should be some data brokers.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.020
There is really some very special information.

46:52.020 --> 46:54.020
No one else.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.020
They never sell it.

46:56.020 --> 46:58.020
Because I think that's the competitive advantage.

46:58.020 --> 47:00.020
Some of you really don't have it.

47:00.020 --> 47:02.020
So they are not selling real data.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.020
They are not saying that I will provide you.

47:04.020 --> 47:06.020
All the scores of this person.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.020
I sell it to you based on our model.

47:08.020 --> 47:10.020
The preferences of these customers.

47:10.020 --> 47:12.020
Both have.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.020
Like if it's that kind.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.020
Fraud detection.

47:16.020 --> 47:18.020
That is.

47:18.020 --> 47:20.020
I sell data to you.

47:20.020 --> 47:22.020
For example, how much is the annual income of this person?

47:22.020 --> 47:24.020
Where does he live?

47:24.020 --> 47:26.020
That kind is sold one by one.

47:26.020 --> 47:28.020
If it's marketing.

47:28.020 --> 47:30.020
I just sell the model.

47:30.020 --> 47:32.020
Ok.

47:32.020 --> 47:34.020
Maybe I can only be sure.

47:34.020 --> 47:36.020
These people.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.020
That is.

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
Their employees may be quite smart.

47:42.020 --> 47:44.020
It may all be automated.

47:44.020 --> 47:46.020
YouTube is the same.

47:46.020 --> 47:48.020
In fact, all processes are automatic.

47:48.020 --> 47:50.020
But it's still the same.

47:50.020 --> 47:52.020
Just like FTC said.

47:52.020 --> 47:54.020
What are they doing?

47:54.020 --> 47:56.020
In fact, no one still knows.

47:56.020 --> 47:58.020
Even though everyone keeps talking about it.

47:58.020 --> 48:00.020
But there is no information.

48:00.020 --> 48:02.020
Too mysterious.

48:02.020 --> 48:04.020
I hope there is a legal expert.

48:04.020 --> 48:06.020
Can answer.

48:06.020 --> 48:08.020
They are on the law.

48:08.020 --> 48:10.020
Is there no regulation?

48:10.020 --> 48:12.020
I have a student.

48:12.020 --> 48:14.020
I told him.

48:14.020 --> 48:16.020
Hey, you next.

48:16.020 --> 48:18.020
When the next assembly.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.020
You mention this regulation.

48:20.020 --> 48:22.020
Control the data broker.

48:22.020 --> 48:24.020
Then he said yes.

48:24.020 --> 48:26.020
He thought about how to do it.

48:26.020 --> 48:28.020
Because before I told him.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
You know Illinois has a.

48:30.020 --> 48:32.020
AI interview act.

48:32.020 --> 48:34.020
That is, if you are using a machine to read.

48:34.020 --> 48:36.020
Job applicants interview video.

48:36.020 --> 48:38.020
You have to disclose.

48:38.020 --> 48:40.020
This thing is all from.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.020
We talked about it in class.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.020
Because he was in my class.

48:44.020 --> 48:46.020
Then I told him, he went to mention it.

48:46.020 --> 48:48.020
Then it happened.

48:48.020 --> 48:50.020
So he often asked me.

48:50.020 --> 48:52.020
Is there any interesting topic?

48:52.020 --> 48:54.020
I think they should pay attention.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
I told them about the data broker.

48:56.020 --> 48:58.020
That depends on.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
How to deal with it.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
Because it's all bad.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.020
There are some controversial issues.

49:06.020 --> 49:08.020
Thank you so much.

49:08.020 --> 49:10.020
Thank you.

49:10.020 --> 49:12.020
Thank you.

49:16.020 --> 49:18.020
Any other questions?

49:30.020 --> 49:32.020
I just want to.

49:32.020 --> 49:34.020
You just mentioned.

49:34.020 --> 49:36.020
I just want to share it quickly.

49:36.020 --> 49:38.020
Information error problem.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.020
Because I applied for a loan.

49:40.020 --> 49:42.020
Then the information is actually.

49:42.020 --> 49:44.020
Some information is wrong.

49:44.020 --> 49:46.020
It's already.

49:46.020 --> 49:48.020
It's not right to meet different people.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.020
Then your credit score is lower.

49:50.020 --> 49:52.020
Then you can't apply for a loan.

49:52.020 --> 49:54.020
So your problem is.

49:54.020 --> 49:56.020
That's a big problem.

49:58.020 --> 50:00.020
But you can't.

50:00.020 --> 50:02.020
Don't tell anyone.

50:02.020 --> 50:04.020
In the United States.

50:04.020 --> 50:06.020
If it's below the credit score.

50:06.020 --> 50:08.020
You can see those public.

50:08.020 --> 50:10.020
The information they grabbed.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
If there is a mistake, you can tell them to correct it.

50:12.020 --> 50:14.020
But.

50:14.020 --> 50:16.020
Then you have to see that there is a mistake.

50:16.020 --> 50:18.020
Otherwise, it's still very difficult.

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
Then if they find the data broker.

50:20.020 --> 50:22.020
You don't know.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.020
What did he see?

50:24.020 --> 50:26.020
Maybe the only way to know.

50:26.020 --> 50:28.020
How does the data broker work?

50:28.020 --> 50:30.020
Become a data broker yourself.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.020
Do I still have time to ask a question?

50:32.020 --> 50:34.020
Can.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.020
I want to ask.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
The question of the background check.

50:38.020 --> 50:40.020
In the United States, you have to find a lot of work.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.020
In fact, they will go through a background check.

50:42.020 --> 50:44.020
I'm just curious.

50:44.020 --> 50:46.020
What kind of information did they get?

50:46.020 --> 50:48.020
That.

50:48.020 --> 50:50.020
Like.

50:50.020 --> 50:52.020
I came here to find a job.

50:52.020 --> 50:54.020
I found that I couldn't find it.

50:54.020 --> 50:56.020
Because he lived in Taiwan for too long.

50:56.020 --> 50:58.020
But how could it be possible?

50:58.020 --> 51:00.020
I can't get the information.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.020
If this kind of thing has always existed.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.020
How could it be possible to receive the information?

51:04.020 --> 51:06.020
I'm just curious.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.020
I just moved in.

51:08.020 --> 51:10.020
It's blank here.

51:10.020 --> 51:12.020
You can't receive it.

51:12.020 --> 51:14.020
Because he should not be across the country.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.020
But he is an American citizen.

51:16.020 --> 51:18.020
He is an American citizen, but he is blank.

51:18.020 --> 51:20.020
Yes, so we are very curious.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.020
How did this happen?

51:22.020 --> 51:24.020
He said he couldn't find the background check.

51:24.020 --> 51:26.020
Can't find any information.

51:26.020 --> 51:28.020
This is too strange.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.020
What our school does most often is.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.020
What is that?

51:32.020 --> 51:34.020
Criminal record.

51:34.020 --> 51:36.020
No matter how light or heavy.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
All have to check.

51:38.020 --> 51:40.020
Many schools are like this.

51:40.020 --> 51:42.020
He will have a connected identification.

51:42.020 --> 51:44.020
I said that kind of data broker.

51:44.020 --> 51:46.020
How many years will they say?

51:46.020 --> 51:48.020
Will you delete all the previous information?

51:48.020 --> 51:50.020
Will there be such a situation?

51:50.020 --> 51:52.020
It's a good question.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.020
How do they deal with this?

51:54.020 --> 51:56.020
All the name changes in the past 25 years.

51:56.020 --> 51:58.020
Residential information.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.020
Will there be in the future?

52:00.020 --> 52:02.020
I don't know.

52:02.020 --> 52:04.020
How long do they have to save?

52:04.020 --> 52:06.020
How long will they save these data?

52:06.020 --> 52:08.020
I'm curious.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.020
The longer it takes for me, the more useful it is.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.020
Because after about 50 years.

52:12.020 --> 52:14.020
You may be the only one.

52:14.020 --> 52:16.020
You are the only one.

52:16.020 --> 52:18.020
People with this information.

52:20.020 --> 52:22.020
That means that company.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.020
Maybe the company's data is not good enough.

52:24.020 --> 52:26.020
Is that possible?

52:26.020 --> 52:28.020
It's possible.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.020
Because like.

52:30.020 --> 52:32.020
According to their FTC data.

52:32.020 --> 52:34.020
They said that the data broker should have.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.020
Almost all the data of all Americans.

52:40.020 --> 52:42.020
Thank you.

52:42.020 --> 52:44.020
This is another issue.

52:44.020 --> 52:46.020
Who has it?

52:46.020 --> 52:48.020
Why is there no one?

52:52.020 --> 52:54.020
Any other questions?

52:54.020 --> 52:56.020
Otherwise.

52:56.020 --> 52:58.020
Today's speech.

52:58.020 --> 53:00.020
Ends here.

53:00.020 --> 53:02.020
Thank you.

53:02.020 --> 53:04.020
David.

53:04.020 --> 53:06.020
For giving us such a wonderful speech.

53:06.020 --> 53:08.020
I think everyone has learned a lot.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.020
And more awareness.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.020
Then.

53:12.020 --> 53:14.020
I hope.

53:14.020 --> 53:16.020
You can come again next time.

53:16.020 --> 53:18.020
Tell us.

53:18.020 --> 53:20.020
How is the future development of this project?

53:20.020 --> 53:22.020
Let's see.

53:22.020 --> 53:24.020
Thank you.

53:24.020 --> 53:26.020
Thank you.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.020
If you haven't become a member.

53:28.020 --> 53:30.020
I want to post a link.

53:30.020 --> 53:32.020
You can join.

53:32.020 --> 53:34.020
It's free.

53:34.020 --> 53:36.020
It's a free.

53:36.020 --> 53:38.020
Membership.

53:38.020 --> 53:40.020
You can continue to receive.

53:40.020 --> 53:42.020
Every week.

53:42.020 --> 53:44.020
There will be a speech.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.020
On different topics.

53:46.020 --> 53:48.020
Thank you.

53:48.020 --> 53:50.020
Thank you.

53:50.020 --> 53:52.020
Thank you.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.020
Thank you.

53:54.020 --> 53:56.020
Thank you.

53:56.020 --> 53:58.020
Bye.
