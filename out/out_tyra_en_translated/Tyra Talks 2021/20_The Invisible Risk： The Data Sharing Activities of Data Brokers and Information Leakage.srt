1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning, good evening, and thank you for joining me today to share my screen.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We don't have a lot of people today, so feel free to interrupt me at any time if you have any questions, or just turn on the microphone.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The topic I'm going to talk about today is called Invisible Risk Data Sharing Activities of Data Brokers.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My co-authors are Aaron, who just got his PhD from Rutgers.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
His PhD peers are also here.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He's going to go to California State University, Fullerton.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The other teacher is a Rutgers teacher.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let me introduce myself.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My background is actually accounting.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a CPA, and I'm a Certified Internal Auditor.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But my PhD is Management Information Systems.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I usually teach data analytics and data mining related courses.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because of my background.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm currently on the list of Fulbright specialists.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I specialize in curriculum development.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've worked with Computer Science before.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They have a task force on how to design cybersecurity curriculum.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'm in that program.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My research is mainly IT management and security management.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Almost all of them are in this area.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I often give lectures outside, maybe at universities, conferences, or some professional organizations.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I used to be a panelist at the Federal Reserve Bank.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
About three or four weeks ago,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I helped them do analytics training at McDonald's.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I also did some training for the California Department of Justice.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I also gave a lecture at the Taiwan Monetary Authority.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In 2018, I was at KPMG, a large audit consulting firm.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was a professor-in-residence there.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I worked with them in New York for 10 weeks.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I also do projects with them.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've done more than 15 projects so far.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm the incoming president of Accounting Information Systems.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is my LinkedIn.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you're interested.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
About this paper.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Data Broker has been around for a long time.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's just that it's been noticed for the past 10 years.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
As you can see, a lot of news is about Data Brokers.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The earliest one I have here is from 2013.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I've been seeing it since this year.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Especially after the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
More news.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who is a Data Broker?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A Data Broker is not the organization we usually come into contact with.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
For example, if we go to a website.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We all know that it collects a lot of our information.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We also know that some websites will sell or share our information.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But the Data Broker is actually hiding behind these websites.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So when it's collecting data, we probably don't know.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
For example, we have a free app on our phone.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then we log in.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In fact, this app is free.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's not free.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's actually because there's an additional information sharing action behind it.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So it's free.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Or, for example, we go to the supermarket to buy something.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All of our purchase records and so on.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In fact, it's all shared behind it.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Or it can go to, for example, Facebook.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All of our public information on Instagram.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So the photos we posted.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What we wrote.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How to write.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it a relationship?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It knows all of these things.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There are also some public sources that it can find.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For example, in Illinois.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For example, who paid for which house's property tax.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's all you can see.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So there's actually public registration information.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And then these companies will collect all of your data.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And if it's not enough, it will go to other Data Brokers.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Share it together or buy it from them.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And after you've bought it, you've sorted it out.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In fact, each of us will have a tag.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It can have some influence.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For example, this person is their family.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There will be a baby recently.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or this person will have access to a golf club.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Or this person is Facebook's social media influencer.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It can all know that you have some preferences.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Or you have some characteristics.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It knows it all.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And this is the most common thing.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
These marketing or advertising Data Brokers.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They can actually do it very accurately.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
For example, when I was in another school.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My colleague, every time he received an advertisement letter, he asked him.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you want to buy a house?

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you want to buy a new car?

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you want to buy a new boat?

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then he got this.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I got it all.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you want to borrow Personal Loan?

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you want to borrow Mortgage?

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How much money do you still have to pay for Mortgage?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you can see that he can know.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is your current financial situation?

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The advertisement he gave you.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's all different.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There are also two more common ones.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fraud Detection and Risk Mitigation.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
For example, when you go to the bank to borrow money.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He needs to make sure that the information you give is correct.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It is also through Data Brokers.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This part is very important.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There are also some websites that actually allow you to find other people's websites.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He also collects the information of these people through Data Brokers.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So you can judge if that person is the one you want to see.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So why is this information useful?

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's actually because if he can get a lot of customer data.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Collect it all.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And then whether it's online or offline.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What happens after he finds it all?

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then he has a way to reconfirm these data.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For example, the same thing.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I went to find it from a lot of sources.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can tell which one is right.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you can put that data quality will be much better.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So he has a way to use it to make some predictions.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then he doesn't care what happens to each of us.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What he wants is this large amount of aggregated data.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then he can make predictions for him.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After this prediction, it's actually very useful.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's because he can sell it.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For example, this person may have to change cars next year.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He has a way to tell these people.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can send a marketing material.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or he can buy more useful information from other Data Brokers.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
To make his data richer.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So you will see all kinds of Data Brokers.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
These four are relatively large.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For example, Axiom is actually very large.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They are all doing marketing campaigns and fraud detection.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then the three people in the back are for business or government.

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For example, tell you what the financial information of these people is.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Or someone told you that his customer transaction.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What does it look like?

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or he can tell you that I have collected this information.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Not just for marketing.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Financial service products can be given.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In fact, this is when you understand all the profiles of a person.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In fact, all the information is very useful.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So what kind of information did they collect?

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Uh, this is a bit vague.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because this is a screenshot.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But if you can see, he actually tells you here.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Axiom is a big Data Broker.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He is a Public Traded Company.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He has 45 years of historical data on name changes and residential history.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He has all the data from the past 45 years.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Who are you here?

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How did you change your name?

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He has it all.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That gender, age, education level.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is very simple for them.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He also knows you.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
For example, what income level do you currently have?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What is the car?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then when there is this information, he can do prediction.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For example, is there anyone in your household?

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Recently planning to have a baby.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Or is it planning to adopt a child?

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Or are you in the United States every year?

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you paying taxes every April?

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or are you a heavy Facebook user?

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or are you easily influenced by social media?

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He has a way to know.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you have major medical insurance?

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
All of these are known.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then, surprisingly, they have more than 3000 different attributes.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So in the United States, everyone, if he has collected your information, he has 3000 different attributes to describe the various characteristics of this person.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So he actually knows very well what happened to each of us.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sometimes we don't even know our own preference.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But these data brokers will know.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then you will find that this is actually quite scary.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The reason is because he is not the organization we will directly contact.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
For example, we go to Amazon.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We know Amazon.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We go to Facebook.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We know it's him.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But he's actually doing these things behind the scenes.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So in 2014, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, they actually have two articles.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They're all talking about this.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What they're talking about in these two articles is actually that they're talking about data brokers.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Their biggest problem is that we don't know what he's doing.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We don't know what information he's collecting.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We don't know what he's doing with our information.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How to share it, how to sell it, who to sell it to.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In fact, we all don't know that his whole practice is actually a black box.

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So we don't know what they're doing at all.

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So this Federal Trade Commission in 2013 and 2014, we hope that everyone can have some action to limit that.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
At least let us know more about what these data brokers are doing.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So this is the main content of these two articles.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So what they're talking about is a very interesting thing, which is data brokers.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They're actually competing with each other to see who they can sell their data to.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So there's no problem.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But they're not actually competing with each other.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They're actually cooperating with each other.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For example, they asked nine data brokers.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then they'll know where each data broker comes from.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
For example, you're collecting public data from government agencies.

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or it could be any other publicly available source.

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But it could be commercial sources.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Or it could be collected from another company and given to you.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You'll see that these nine data brokers actually have very different ways of collecting data.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Some people only use commercial sources.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Some people use everything.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And the most special thing is that although they're usually competing for clients,

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that is, who can buy their data,

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but you can see that their data is actually shared with each other.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Or you can say, ah, I've collected this data today.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And then if you need it, I'll sell it to you.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So you can see that they're a very complex network.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And in these nine, there are actually only seven,

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
which is the one on the bottom left.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The seventh is that it has nothing to do with other data brokers.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There are no data sharing activities.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Everyone else will buy or sell to a certain extent.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or where do you share it from?

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They all have it.

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This thing is very interesting to us.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The reason is because if they don't just collect it themselves,

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
they'll take other people's stuff and use it together.

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If today the hacker can attack a certain data broker,

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it's actually like a grand prize.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The reason is because the data you get is not just his.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All the information you get and all the other people,

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
all the information they share with each other.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's actually our hypothesis.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's just that we later found out that there really was this thing.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
For example, many years ago, in 2018,

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Equifax had a big breach.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They forgot to update their software inside,

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
so they had a big breach.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Their breach is actually not just Equifax's data being leaked.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In addition to Equifax,

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the other two big credit bureaus,

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
which is Experian and TransUnion,

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
are actually all leaked.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In fact, our data collection is from Dark Web.

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So we actually found that

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
if you go and find Equifax's data breach,

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you can actually see the data of the other two.

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's actually all mixed up.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There's also some anecdotal evidence.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
When Equifax had a breach,

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the other two reported the credit fraud data.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So all the data is actually leaked.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If we go to, for example, Google Trend,

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and look at their fraud report trend,

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
you'll find that these three are actually almost the same trend.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
One company has a problem,

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and the other two have a problem.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We think that this is definitely because

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
of the influence of the exchange of information between them.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So as long as one person has a problem,

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
everything will happen.

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's a lot of trouble.

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So you'll see that in fact,

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
there are a lot of regulations in the United States.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They've been around since 2013.

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The early focus was actually that

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
these data brokers should let those consumers know

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
what kind of data they've collected.

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So in 2013 and 2014,

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Axiom would actually let every user,

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
no matter who you are,

269
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
you go and log into your data,

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and then you can see what information you have.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You can see it all.

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There are also some other points that

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
they feel are not transparent at all.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is your practice?

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What did you collect?

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who did you sell it to?

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So far, it's all black box.

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is early 2013 and 2014.

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then in 2018 and 2019,

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
there were two new things.

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In Vermont,

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
there's a data broker law.

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It says,

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
if you're a data broker,

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
we'll talk about its definition later.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you're a data broker,

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
you should register with its Secretary of State.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
To register,

289
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
simply put,

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
before the end of January every year,

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you have to go to its website

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and provide all your data to it.

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The provided data actually looks like this.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Which company are you from?

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is your website?

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And then if the user doesn't want you to collect information,

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
can you opt out?

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't want you to collect.

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So how do you do it?

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It actually has all the details of the disclosure.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Or it says,

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
do you have any

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
statement about opt-out

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
or data collection?

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can actually write it up.

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This example is written a lot.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Some companies,

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
although it says it's registered,

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but in fact,

310
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
you'll see that there's no information at all.

311
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
A lot of them just say,

312
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
please see our website.

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If you click on it,

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
there's nothing there.

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can hardly see it.

316
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is one.

317
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The second question is actually

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
data broker,

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
even if it meets the definition of regulation,

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it's a data broker.

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If it doesn't register,

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
the penalty is actually very low.

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I forgot if it's Vermont or California State.

324
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you don't register,

325
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
you'll only be fined $100 a day.

326
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And it's online.

327
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I've been fined,

328
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
for example,

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
$10,000,

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and I can't pay anymore.

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
For data brokers,

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
this is almost nothing.

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They might make more than $10,000 a day.

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So,

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
uh,

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the penalty is actually not that big.

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not like GDPR,

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
which has such a big impact on European privacy regulation.

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you have a violation,

340
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
it's just a few percent annual sales revenue.

341
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So,

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
the effect of this thing is not that good.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So,

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
it's actually very simple to define.

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Simply put,

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
when a company,

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you know you're collecting data,

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
or you know you're selling it,

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you take the data you've collected and sell it.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And then it's actually a data broker.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
As long as you collect the data and sell the data,

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you're not directly facing those customers,

353
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
it's actually a data broker.

354
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So,

355
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
uh,

356
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
it's actually a pretty big definition.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But actually,

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you have to think about this definition.

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's very simple.

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
For example,

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
if you only collect data,

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
buy the data and use it yourself,

363
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you're not a data broker.

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Or,

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
say,

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the data you collect is actually your customer's data.

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
For example,

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Amazon,

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
what I collect is actually the data of these people who buy things from me.

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then I take these things and sell them.

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Actually,

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not a data broker.

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So,

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
there's actually a loophole.

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So,

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that's going to cause some problems.

377
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
A lot of companies are actually data brokers,

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because they're actually doing business.

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But,

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
uh,

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
according to this law,

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
you can't actually see it.

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The California State is the same.

384
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Uh,

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
that is,

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
if you go to his Attorney General's office,

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you can also see this big,

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
uh,

389
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
almost all the requests are exactly the same.

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's just that it started working a year later.

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It started working in January 2020.

392
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
All the definitions are the same.

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Almost everything is the same.

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Although,

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
uh,

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
California's privacy regulation is actually more strict.

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But it's actually the same in this regard.

398
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So,

399
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the information he's going to reveal is actually almost the same.

400
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So,

401
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
uh,

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
if you don't have a chance to go to their website,

403
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
you can see something like that.

404
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So,

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
uh,

406
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
let's talk about it very quickly.

407
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Uh,

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
we think,

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
why do they compete with each other and cooperate with each other?

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why do you think this is going to happen to them in the future?

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Security breach or,

412
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
or,

413
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
or information will,

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
will,

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
will be stolen by someone.

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This state is actually related to the reason.

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The first big point is actually not in this.

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Competition or data sharing.

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's actually because it's actually an unregulated industry.

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He said,

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
he said,

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
everything is actually self-regulated.

423
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They have their own privacy standards.

424
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They have their own norms.

425
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But,

426
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
uh,

427
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
for us,

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
in fact,

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
they are unregulated.

430
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That is.

431
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You take your information and share it.

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Uh,

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
what is your penalty?

434
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Or,

435
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what can be shared?

436
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What can't be shared?

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
In fact,

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
there are no restrictions at all.

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Simply put.

440
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So,

441
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
if there is a hacker.

442
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If you can find a data broker,

443
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
if you can take all his information,

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
the impact will be great.

445
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So,

446
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
this is why,

447
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
like Equifax,

448
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
the main one.

449
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
In fact,

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the main one is a data broker.

451
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If there is a breach,

452
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it will have a great impact.

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
These information can actually be sold.

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So,

455
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that will have a greater impact.

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So,

457
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
there are more benefits.

458
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So,

459
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
people are more likely to want to go,

460
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
uh,

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
get your information and sell it.

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So,

463
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
this paper is still in a very rough stage.

464
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But I think,

465
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
uh,

466
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
we still hope to be able to present.

467
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And then I hope to give you some awareness.

468
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Or,

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
uh,

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
some extra ideas.

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Especially in,

472
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
uh,

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
how to protect privacy protection.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or,

475
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
how to be more,

476
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
more effective to understand what they are doing.

477
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So,

478
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
uh,

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you will see that in fact,

480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
our hypothesis,

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
in fact,

482
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
everything is still in a very rough stage.

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So,

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
but we still hope to be able to share more.

485
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So,

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the other one is,

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
uh,

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
we want to know if this registration has any impact.

489
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Uh,

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we,

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
of course,

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
we let these broad data brokers,

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
they are all transparent.

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Or,

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
everyone knows who they are.

496
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Will they say,

497
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
their practice is better?

498
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They are more transparent.

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Or,

500
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
they have some pressure to say,

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
they can't be so easy.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There will be a security breach.

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But the problem is actually in,

504
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
not this regulation.

505
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
In fact,

506
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
because even if you don't register,

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
it doesn't actually work.

508
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So,

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
uh,

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think,

511
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
uh,

512
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think,

513
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
uh,

514
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I think,

515
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
uh,

516
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
uh.

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So,

518
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
uh,

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
so.

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Uh,

521
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
so,

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
uh,

523
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
uh,

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
so.

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Uh,

526
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
so.

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Uh,

528
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
uh,

529
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
so.

530
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
uh,

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so,

532
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
uh,

533
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
uh.

534
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Uh,

535
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
uh.

536
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Uh,

537
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
uh.

538
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Uh,

539
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
uh,

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
uh,

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
uh,

542
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
uh,

543
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
so.

544
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Uh,

545
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
uh.

546
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
So,

547
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
uh.

548
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
So,

549
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Unique.

845
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,020
Conclusion.

846
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
This research is actually very rough.

847
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,020
That's actually an ongoing project.

848
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Actually, we've always wanted to keep going.

849
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,020
The focus of our presentation today is actually that we want to

850
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,020
improve everyone's awareness of data brokers.

851
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Or I hope to encourage everyone to say that if you are interested,

852
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
you can join this project.

853
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,020
So we can think about how we can do it.

854
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,020
Uh, more accurately or more effectively.

855
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
Data collection.

856
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Sharing the practices.

857
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
Privacy protection.

858
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Privacy regulation.

859
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
Law-related.

860
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
Regulation-related.

861
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Transparency.

862
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Transparency.

863
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
Talk.

864
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
Stop sharing.

865
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
No problem.

866
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Very clear.

867
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,020
I just want to think about it.

868
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,020
I don't know much about this, but I think it's a very important issue.

869
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,020
I want to share with you.

870
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,020
How do you protect your own data?

871
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,020
For example, because every website you use now has cookies.

872
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Then you have to accept or reject.

873
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Then there's something we can do to protect it.

874
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
Or it's already too late.

875
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,020
Our profile is already known to everyone.

876
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,020
We found that most of the data is already out there.

877
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
So we have to protect it.

878
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
We have to protect it.

879
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
We have to protect it.

880
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
We have to protect it.

881
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
So most of the data is already out there.

882
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,020
And then I'm trying something now.

883
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
It's a cookie on the website.

884
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,020
For example, I'm connected to Wall Street Journal today.

885
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
I'm connected to Amazon today.

886
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
What's behind it?

887
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,020
Collecting our data or activity.

888
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,020
Uh, we found that actually.

889
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,020
I can't control it in the middle of an upper bound and lower bound.

890
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
Upper bound is to say.

891
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Uh, I'm Google today.

892
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
In the situation of signing in.

893
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
So Chrome knows who I am.

894
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
In that case,

895
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
In fact, they collect a lot of data.

896
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
It's pretty amazing.

897
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,020
But if I'm not logged in at all.

898
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,020
My browser is open again in private mode.

899
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
That can be limited to the amount.

900
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
It's a lot worse.

901
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,020
So that's another way.

902
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
Just try to close it.

903
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
No way.

904
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,020
There are some cookies that are actually more troublesome.

905
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Uh.

906
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Although he told you,

907
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Do you want to accept it?

908
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,020
But in fact, whether you accept it or not.

909
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
That's the way it is.

910
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
You can't see any effect.

911
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,020
There are some websites that can make you willing to let you choose.

912
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Uh, different cookies.

913
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
At that time, there was.

914
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,020
But some of them can't be turned off.

915
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Because he has to know who you are.

916
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
Otherwise, you can't browse the website.

917
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Yeah, so, uh.

918
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
There are still some restrictions.

919
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Yeah, but, uh.

920
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
You'll know that they've actually collected a lot of data.

921
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
In fact, you probably know who we are.

922
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
What are we doing?

923
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Um.

924
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Yeah, that's terrible.

925
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Yeah, well, uh.

926
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
I have another one with a computer science.

927
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
Before doing it.

928
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,020
We can actually use it.

929
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,020
Posts on social media.

930
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
We have a way to predict, uh.

931
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Buying clothes or buying accessories.

932
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Preference.

933
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
And then there's that.

934
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
We can know that.

935
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
What kind of clothes do you like to wear next season?

936
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,020
Color, brand.

937
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,020
And that prediction accuracy rate is probably over 90%.

938
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,020
That, uh, that's a lot of trouble.

939
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
It's just that we do it ourselves.

940
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
It's just that we collect it ourselves.

941
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
We have a very small part of the data.

942
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
We can do it so well.

943
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
You can tell that they're going to do it.

944
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,020
It's actually easier.

945
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
Then you would think.

946
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,020
Try not to post your own.

947
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Too many personal things.

948
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Or preferences or something.

949
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
But I think.

950
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
We still have a question.

951
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
I think so.

952
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,020
This is a preference.

953
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Uh.

954
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Uh, if we don't share this information.

955
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,020
We can't have those customized services.

956
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Our search will be very bad.

957
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Uh, it's almost not what you want.

958
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Yeah, so if we want.

959
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
You can't do anything about the specific service.

960
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
You have to write, right?

961
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
But this is actually a preference.

962
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
So I'm talking about what they said to Google before.

963
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
That's more accurate.

964
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,020
What is your privacy?

965
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,020
It's your own decision.

966
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
It's actually from 0 to 100.

967
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
How much do I want to share?

968
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
It depends on what you like.

969
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

970
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Then we have a question.

971
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
Uh.

972
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
You are me.

973
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,020
My name is Chen Peiying.

974
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
I am now at Indiana University.

975
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Read information science.

976
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Although I don't do data privacy related issues.

977
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
But because this is very popular now.

978
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
So I just wanted to say.

979
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Let's listen to the speech.

980
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,020
I think there are a lot of gains.

981
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Especially this kind of data broker role.

982
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
At least in our field.

983
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
This kind of investment information related area.

984
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
In fact, it is less mentioned.

985
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
Everyone is basically targeting a single website.

986
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
This kind of.

987
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Uh.

988
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
Data privacy is being discussed.

989
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
So my question is, since this is a data broker.

990
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Um.

991
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,020
How do you say they are very critical?

992
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,020
They have so much data on their hands.

993
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,020
Why would they let their own data so easily?

994
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Give it out.

995
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Just their own privacy.

996
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,020
Their own privacy.

997
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Their data security.

998
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,020
And because once they are leaked.

999
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Just assume that I am a.

1000
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
I have that data set.

1001
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,020
But I was harmed.

1002
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,020
This information is somehow.

1003
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,020
It is available on the website.

1004
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Yeah.

1005
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Isn't he supposed to prevent this from happening?

1006
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Yeah.

1007
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
So we think it's very.

1008
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
This is the weirdest thing we think.

1009
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
And you see there are so many competitors.

1010
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
To say that this is actually a very.

1011
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
Profitable business.

1012
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,020
So there will be thousands of companies.

1013
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
In fact, doing this kind of thing.

1014
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
But their information is.

1015
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Everyone has it.

1016
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,020
But he can still continue to sell.

1017
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
So why do we want to know more?

1018
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,020
What are they doing?

1019
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
And what happened?

1020
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
But the problem is that they are actually hidden players.

1021
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
That is.

1022
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
They don't even know who they are.

1023
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Or the company name.

1024
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,020
It doesn't make sense.

1025
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,020
It's like a mess.

1026
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,020
It's like we're talking about it in class.

1027
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,020
So I can't find them at all.

1028
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,020
So if there are more people.

1029
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,020
You can jump in and find a way to know.

1030
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,020
Who are they?

1031
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,020
What are they doing?

1032
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
That would be very helpful.

1033
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,020
We would love to know.

1034
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Because.

1035
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
That will have a lot of impact.

1036
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Because, for example, Amazon or Google.

1037
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
They are actually sitting on a mountain of data.

1038
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,020
So if we can find their security.

1039
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
It would be very useful.

1040
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Like Amazon, he actually.

1041
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
He put his report.

1042
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
It's their information system.

1043
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
The audit report of security control.

1044
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,020
It's all shared on the website.

1045
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,020
They are very confident that we are very good.

1046
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
But these people are actually.

1047
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
It's completely blank.

1048
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
For example, since they have registered.

1049
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
And then, although there is no URL.

1050
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
Will they at least provide one?

1051
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,020
Like a physical address.

1052
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
That is to say, my company is definitely open.

1053
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,020
In a place like this.

1054
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,020
They have a physical address.

1055
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Like a registered address and a phone number.

1056
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Is there any more.

1057
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
Is there a clear geographical distribution?

1058
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,020
Or is it actually.

1059
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
I don't think so.

1060
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,020
We can't see any.

1061
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Specific phenomenon.

1062
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,020
Because they collect data.

1063
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,020
In fact, there is no limit to a specific.

1064
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,020
State or something.

1065
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,020
Because for example.

1066
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,020
Because after all, you can pass it on.

1067
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
To another server.

1068
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
Because I know they will have some distribution.

1069
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,020
For example, I need this.

1070
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
I remember it seems to be Google and Amazon.

1071
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,020
They have to find that kind of resource.

1072
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,020
All kinds of natural resources.

1073
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,020
Very rich place.

1074
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
I want to have enough electricity and water.

1075
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,020
I want to make sure he has a power outage.

1076
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Very warm.

1077
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
But these things are actually.

1078
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,020
It's not a company.

1079
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,020
It's not their physical address.

1080
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
Must be.

1081
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Not necessarily related.

1082
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
Their company may be very small.

1083
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
Because they are actually not sitting in the office at all.

1084
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Those people.

1085
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
That's right.

1086
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
I was talking about this before.

1087
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,020
Someone said that we have no way to know.

1088
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
Who is the European data broker?

1089
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
Because of the GDPR.

1090
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
The privacy law.

1091
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,020
His control should be stricter.

1092
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,020
So if we can find them.

1093
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Maybe they have more information.

1094
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
It's easier to know what they're doing.

1095
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,020
But I still don't know.

1096
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,020
That's our data source.

1097
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,020
Where to find it.

1098
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
In fact, we don't know yet.

1099
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,020
So this is interesting.

1100
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,020
We think this is really like research.

1101
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
I don't know what I'm doing.

1102
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,020
I think it's a very interesting relationship.

1103
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,020
Because like you said.

1104
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,020
It's a school hire.

1105
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,020
He's still looking for these companies.

1106
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,020
He's using your background.

1107
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
To make a background check.

1108
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
So I think there's some information hidden in it.

1109
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
It's not right.

1110
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
You said the school information office.

1111
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Why don't you find someone to find it directly?

1112
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
Maybe you can find it.

1113
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,020
But it may be based on various cost considerations.

1114
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
We just have to sell your information to these companies.

1115
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
So there is a.

1116
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
There is no mutual benefit.

1117
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,020
But I think there is a relationship between the two.

1118
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
Why are these people.

1119
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Although we think they are doing something.

1120
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
But in fact.

1121
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
You probably.

1122
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,020
Because it's a school.

1123
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,020
He still relies on.

1124
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Relying on these brokers.

1125
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,020
To provide some information.

1126
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,020
That's like a financial institution.

1127
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,020
We go to apply.

1128
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
For example, mortgages.

1129
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,020
He is also exchanging information with these people.

1130
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,020
To confirm our.

1131
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
Are we giving the right thing?

1132
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
It's just that this side is more compliant.

1133
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,020
This side is more highly regulated.

1134
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,020
For example, there is something called.

1135
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,020
Fair Credit Act.

1136
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Something like this.

1137
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,020
We can review our credit score.

1138
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,020
In case something is wrong, we can ask him to change it.

1139
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
There is.

1140
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,020
But like other data brokers.

1141
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
If his information is wrong.

1142
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,020
In fact, we don't know where his information is wrong.

1143
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,020
Or where is it wrong?

1144
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,020
If people use this to verify.

1145
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,020
Who are we?

1146
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,020
In case it's all different.

1147
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,020
Then the problem is big.

1148
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,020
Another question is.

1149
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,020
There are so many competitors.

1150
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,020
Their niche.

1151
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,020
What is their selling point?

1152
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,020
I can only think of it now.

1153
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,020
It's just that you use some wrong information.

1154
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020
To earn that kind of benefit.

1155
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,020
Because if I know there is a company.

1156
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,020
Can provide more.

1157
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,020
What is the so-called more accurate?

1158
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
How to define it?

1159
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,020
Right.

1160
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,020
Or whose model is better?

1161
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,020
Or who has it?

1162
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,020
But there should be some data brokers.

1163
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,020
There is really some very special information.

1164
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,020
No one else.

1165
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
They never sell it.

1166
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,020
Because I think that's the competitive advantage.

1167
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Some of you really don't have it.

1168
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,020
So they are not selling real data.

1169
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,020
They are not saying that I will provide you.

1170
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,020
All the scores of this person.

1171
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,020
I sell it to you based on our model.

1172
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,020
The preferences of these customers.

1173
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,020
Both have.

1174
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,020
Like if it's that kind.

1175
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,020
Fraud detection.

1176
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,020
That is.

1177
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
I sell data to you.

1178
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,020
For example, how much is the annual income of this person?

1179
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,020
Where does he live?

1180
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,020
That kind is sold one by one.

1181
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,020
If it's marketing.

1182
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,020
I just sell the model.

1183
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,020
Ok.

1184
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,020
Maybe I can only be sure.

1185
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,020
These people.

1186
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,020
That is.

1187
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Their employees may be quite smart.

1188
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,020
It may all be automated.

1189
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,020
YouTube is the same.

1190
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
In fact, all processes are automatic.

1191
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,020
But it's still the same.

1192
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,020
Just like FTC said.

1193
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,020
What are they doing?

1194
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,020
In fact, no one still knows.

1195
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,020
Even though everyone keeps talking about it.

1196
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,020
But there is no information.

1197
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,020
Too mysterious.

1198
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,020
I hope there is a legal expert.

1199
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,020
Can answer.

1200
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,020
They are on the law.

1201
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,020
Is there no regulation?

1202
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,020
I have a student.

1203
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
I told him.

1204
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,020
Hey, you next.

1205
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
When the next assembly.

1206
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,020
You mention this regulation.

1207
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020
Control the data broker.

1208
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,020
Then he said yes.

1209
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,020
He thought about how to do it.

1210
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,020
Because before I told him.

1211
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,020
You know Illinois has a.

1212
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,020
AI interview act.

1213
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
That is, if you are using a machine to read.

1214
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,020
Job applicants interview video.

1215
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,020
You have to disclose.

1216
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,020
This thing is all from.

1217
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,020
We talked about it in class.

1218
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,020
Because he was in my class.

1219
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,020
Then I told him, he went to mention it.

1220
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,020
Then it happened.

1221
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,020
So he often asked me.

1222
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
Is there any interesting topic?

1223
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,020
I think they should pay attention.

1224
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,020
I told them about the data broker.

1225
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
That depends on.

1226
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,020
How to deal with it.

1227
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,020
Because it's all bad.

1228
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,020
There are some controversial issues.

1229
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,020
Thank you so much.

1230
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Thank you.

1231
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,020
Thank you.

1232
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
Any other questions?

1233
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,020
I just want to.

1234
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,020
You just mentioned.

1235
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,020
I just want to share it quickly.

1236
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,020
Information error problem.

1237
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,020
Because I applied for a loan.

1238
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,020
Then the information is actually.

1239
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,020
Some information is wrong.

1240
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,020
It's already.

1241
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,020
It's not right to meet different people.

1242
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
Then your credit score is lower.

1243
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Then you can't apply for a loan.

1244
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,020
So your problem is.

1245
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,020
That's a big problem.

1246
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,020
But you can't.

1247
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Don't tell anyone.

1248
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,020
In the United States.

1249
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,020
If it's below the credit score.

1250
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,020
You can see those public.

1251
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,020
The information they grabbed.

1252
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
If there is a mistake, you can tell them to correct it.

1253
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
But.

1254
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,020
Then you have to see that there is a mistake.

1255
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,020
Otherwise, it's still very difficult.

1256
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,020
Then if they find the data broker.

1257
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,020
You don't know.

1258
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,020
What did he see?

1259
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,020
Maybe the only way to know.

1260
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,020
How does the data broker work?

1261
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,020
Become a data broker yourself.

1262
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,020
Do I still have time to ask a question?

1263
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
Can.

1264
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
I want to ask.

1265
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
The question of the background check.

1266
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
In the United States, you have to find a lot of work.

1267
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
In fact, they will go through a background check.

1268
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,020
I'm just curious.

1269
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,020
What kind of information did they get?

1270
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,020
That.

1271
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
Like.

1272
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
I came here to find a job.

1273
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,020
I found that I couldn't find it.

1274
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,020
Because he lived in Taiwan for too long.

1275
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,020
But how could it be possible?

1276
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,020
I can't get the information.

1277
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,020
If this kind of thing has always existed.

1278
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,020
How could it be possible to receive the information?

1279
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
I'm just curious.

1280
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,020
I just moved in.

1281
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
It's blank here.

1282
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,020
You can't receive it.

1283
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
Because he should not be across the country.

1284
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
But he is an American citizen.

1285
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
He is an American citizen, but he is blank.

1286
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
Yes, so we are very curious.

1287
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
How did this happen?

1288
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
He said he couldn't find the background check.

1289
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
Can't find any information.

1290
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,020
This is too strange.

1291
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
What our school does most often is.

1292
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
What is that?

1293
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
Criminal record.

1294
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,020
No matter how light or heavy.

1295
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
All have to check.

1296
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,020
Many schools are like this.

1297
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,020
He will have a connected identification.

1298
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,020
I said that kind of data broker.

1299
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
How many years will they say?

1300
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
Will you delete all the previous information?

1301
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Will there be such a situation?

1302
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
It's a good question.

1303
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,020
How do they deal with this?

1304
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,020
All the name changes in the past 25 years.

1305
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,020
Residential information.

1306
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Will there be in the future?

1307
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,020
I don't know.

1308
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
How long do they have to save?

1309
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
How long will they save these data?

1310
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,020
I'm curious.

1311
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
The longer it takes for me, the more useful it is.

1312
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,020
Because after about 50 years.

1313
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,020
You may be the only one.

1314
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,020
You are the only one.

1315
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,020
People with this information.

1316
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,020
That means that company.

1317
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
Maybe the company's data is not good enough.

1318
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,020
Is that possible?

1319
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,020
It's possible.

1320
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,020
Because like.

1321
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,020
According to their FTC data.

1322
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
They said that the data broker should have.

1323
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
Almost all the data of all Americans.

1324
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,020
Thank you.

1325
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,020
This is another issue.

1326
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,020
Who has it?

1327
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,020
Why is there no one?

1328
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,020
Any other questions?

1329
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,020
Otherwise.

1330
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,020
Today's speech.

1331
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
Ends here.

1332
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
Thank you.

1333
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
David.

1334
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,020
For giving us such a wonderful speech.

1335
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,020
I think everyone has learned a lot.

1336
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,020
And more awareness.

1337
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,020
Then.

1338
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,020
I hope.

1339
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,020
You can come again next time.

1340
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,020
Tell us.

1341
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
How is the future development of this project?

1342
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
Let's see.

1343
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,020
Thank you.

1344
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Thank you.

00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,020

1346
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,020

There will be a speech.

On different topics.

1355
