0	5000	Okay, thank you.
5000	9000	Thank you, everyone.
9000	15000	I'd like to share my screen with you.
15000	18000	This is the topic I'm going to talk about today.
18000	27000	The influence of early Western missionary Chinese education on modern Chinese language and culture.
27000	30000	First of all, this is a very new topic.
30000	36000	In fact, it is my experience of studying the history of Chinese education in the past few years.
36000	46000	Because it is the first time to publish, there may be some lack of evidence or some points of view are not mature enough.
46000	50000	So I'd like to ask you to give me some feedback later.
50000	56000	Or you are welcome to contact me after the meeting.
56000	57000	So thank you, everyone.
57000	60000	In addition, I would like to thank my instructor.
60000	64000	Because the idea of ​​this topic is probably related to his leadership.
64000	66000	That is, Professor Xin Shichuang.
66000	71000	There is also my Chinese teacher, the instructor of the course, Mr. Gu Baili.
71000	77000	This whole topic and some of the content is also the result of the cooperation between this teacher and the teacher.
77000	83000	Okay, so let's get into my structure first.
84000	88000	The topic of my report today is roughly divided into three parts.
88000	89000	The first is the preface.
89000	91000	The second is the main part.
91000	98000	Discuss how missionary Chinese education affects the influence of this country's language and culture.
98000	101000	I will discuss it at about 6 o'clock.
101000	103000	The third part is the conclusion.
103000	106000	At the beginning of this part, I would like to explain to you first.
107000	114000	In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the influence of missionary Chinese education on China.
114000	124000	But this topic focuses on the ideas developed by the missionary to learn Chinese.
124000	126000	Or his learning process.
126000	128000	Or some of his teaching materials.
128000	132000	How do these things affect modern China?
132000	136000	We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on science.
136000	140000	We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on painting and architecture.
140000	144000	We will focus on the impact of missionary Chinese education on language learning.
144000	150000	Now, let's first understand how missionary Chinese education entered China.
150000	162000	In fact, the spread of religion is very long and has a great impact on the interaction of various nations around the world.
162000	168000	China's earliest external religious exchange was Buddhist culture.
168000	171000	What impact does Buddhist culture have on China?
172000	179000	At that time, there was a lot of communication between Buddhism and Chinese in the Wei, Jin, Nan, and North Dynasties.
179000	183000	This actually stimulated the development of Chinese linguistics.
183000	187000	Chinese linguistics is said to be four-vowels.
187000	191000	One of the characteristics of Chinese linguistics is that we have a tone.
191000	195000	In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.
195000	201000	In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.
201000	205000	The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,
205000	209000	The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,
209000	213000	the second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.
213000	217000	The second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.
217000	221000	The missionary Chinese education did not come from the West.
221000	225000	However, what we are discussing today is the missionary of the West.
225000	229000	Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,
229000	235000	Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,
235000	239000	I emphasize that there is systematic learning of Chinese.
239000	243000	In fact, Catholicism has been passed down in China for a long time.
243000	247000	A while ago, there was a very famous TV series called The Twelve Hours of Chang'an.
247000	249000	Many people may have seen it.
249000	251000	It talks about the Great Qing Jin religion.
251000	255000	In fact, it is the Eastern Catholicism at that time.
255000	257000	It is based on Syrian literature.
257000	261000	There is a Persian prince in it.
261000	265000	It represents the entry of Catholicism at that time.
265000	268000	However, as early as the Tang Dynasty,
268000	272000	there was already a translation of the Tantric literature version.
272000	276000	However, the Catholicism has been in contact with China for a long time.
276000	278000	In the Song Dynasty, the Catholicism has become more subdued.
278000	280000	In the Yuan Dynasty, the Catholicism has reached another peak.
280000	284000	We know that the Yuan Dynasty people have a so-called Sermon people.
284000	286000	The Sermon people are Westerners.
286000	292000	A story that everyone is familiar with is the Marco Polo travel diary.
292000	296000	Marco Polo is a businessman.
296000	300000	He came to the Yuan Dynasty with some religious missions and met the emperor.
300000	306000	Later, Pope Francis sent him directly to the Yuan Dynasty to make contact with China.
306000	311000	However, these contacts did not really become a systematic study of Chinese.
311000	317000	The real beginning of Chinese research is still at the end of the Ming Dynasty.
317000	319000	At the end of the Ming Dynasty, at the end of the 16th century,
319000	325000	the Jesuit Church was established in France.
326000	329000	The Jesuit Church has a strong mission to preach,
329000	333000	and they are willing to go to the distant Far East to explore.
333000	337000	The second point is the great breakthrough and invention of the sea.
337000	341000	The people we just talked about are all through the road,
341000	345000	which we are more familiar with is the Silk Road to China.
345000	347000	The road is very far away.
347000	349000	This is more difficult and dangerous.
349000	355000	The Jesuit Church at the end of the Ming Dynasty is mostly through the Silk Road.
355000	361000	The Jesuit Church went from the Silk Road to Haowangjiao,
361000	368000	then to the Middle East, and then to India.
368000	370000	Let's look at the two peak periods.
370000	375000	The first is the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the end of the 16th century.
375000	379000	The second is the second peak period after the Opium War.
379000	383000	In the early period, it was mainly the Catholic Church in Europe.
383000	385000	After the middle of the 19th century,
385000	389000	it was the new era of the Jesuit Church.
389000	393000	The real long-term and continuous impact
393000	397000	is actually more concentrated after the middle of the 19th century.
397000	403000	Now let's see how these missionary Chinese studies have affected China.
403000	407000	First of all, many of our friends online
407000	412000	are teachers and predecessors in the Chinese education field.
412000	415000	How did Chinese education become an independent subject?
415000	417000	Today, many people think that
417000	419000	after the Second World War,
419000	422000	it separated from traditional Chinese studies.
422000	426000	In fact, it may have started to separate earlier, at this time.
426000	430000	The original Chinese and Chinese studies,
430000	432000	that is, the synology we are talking about,
432000	434000	cannot be distinguished.
434000	438000	With the arrival of Luo Mingjian,
438000	442000	these people brought back a large number of Chinese classics
442000	444000	and translated them into Latin.
444000	446000	Then it spread to Europe.
446000	450000	We know that this is the Chinese heat of the enlightenment period.
450000	454000	The Sun King Louis XIV was very fond of Chinese culture,
454000	456000	especially the rise of rationalism.
456000	462000	They found that the distant Eastern Empire was godless.
462000	466000	They were very curious about the idea of ​​godlessness in Confucianism.
466000	470000	So at that time in Paris,
470000	474000	the Chinese hot trend was the fashion of the upper-class society.
474000	478000	So you have to wear Chinese silk, drink Chinese tea,
478000	482000	and discuss the Four Books and Five Sutras.
482000	484000	This is the rise of Chinese Chinese studies.
484000	486000	However, at this time,
486000	490000	because China and the West did not have direct contact,
490000	496000	Chinese studies at this time focused on the study of thought and culture,
496000	500000	and there was no need for actual language communication.
500000	506000	However, with the large number of Jesuits sent to China,
506000	510000	they actually began to come into contact with China.
510000	512000	These Jesuits had a need for preaching,
512000	516000	so they began to actively study Chinese.
516000	520000	Therefore, these Jesuits in China
520000	524000	began to independently develop language learning,
524000	526000	Chinese-language second language learning,
526000	528000	into an independent subject,
528000	532000	and made a distinction with Chinese studies based on thought.
532000	534000	For example, Gu Saifeng and Dai Suiliang,
534000	538000	who were the priests of the Jesuits,
538000	542000	began to write professional Chinese textbooks,
542000	544000	such as Chinese Introduction.
544000	548000	Next is the New Religion.
548000	550000	The New Religion I'm talking about
550000	554000	is the so-called Christian religion.
554000	556000	In the missionary history of the US Department of State,
556000	558000	as you are familiar with,
558000	562000	Wei Sanwei also published a ten-chapter text in English.
562000	566000	This ten-chapter ten refers to ten difficulties,
566000	568000	from the most basic words,
568000	570000	to the conversation in Chinese,
570000	572000	to the final reading material.
572000	574000	This is what makes Chinese studies
574000	576000	an independent subject.
576000	578000	This is the first impact.
578000	582000	The second impact is the development of Chinese-language language learning.
582000	584000	In our traditional Chinese primary schools,
584000	586000	as you are familiar with,
586000	588000	the study of Chinese characters,
588000	590000	is based on the study of Chinese characters.
590000	592000	The emphasis is on the character,
592000	596000	but the study of grammar has not been developed.
596000	600000	For Western Chinese-language learners,
600000	604000	especially those with Latin and Romance languages,
604000	608000	there is a huge difference in grammar.
608000	610000	It is very difficult for them to learn.
610000	612000	Even in the early days,
612000	614000	when they were reading literature,
614000	616000	the literature was very simple.
616000	618000	In addition to the grammar,
618000	620000	it was very difficult for them to grasp.
620000	622000	They even mistakenly thought that
622000	624000	there was no grammar in Chinese.
624000	626000	Recently,
626000	628000	the study of Chinese teaching history
628000	630000	has become more popular,
630000	632000	so a lot of information has been discovered.
632000	634000	Some of the information that you may be familiar with
634000	636000	is probably on my side.
636000	638000	There are some relatively new sayings.
638000	640000	First of all,
640000	642000	in the first book,
642000	644000	a Chinese-language book
644000	646000	written by a teacher from Laihua,
646000	648000	is written by Huankobo,
648000	650000	the father of the Taoism Society.
650000	652000	This book is actually dead.
652000	654000	It was because modern scholars
654000	656000	were studying the history of Chinese teaching,
656000	658000	and they found that
658000	660000	this book was mentioned
660000	662000	in the internal documents of the Taoism Society.
662000	664000	So it was designated as the earliest Chinese book.
664000	666000	In addition,
666000	668000	there is a book called
668000	670000	Huangjialue,
670000	672000	which is probably the first book
672000	674000	written in Chinese.
674000	676000	There are many scholars in the mainland
676000	678000	who have been designated
678000	680000	as scholars
680000	682000	from China
682000	684000	to France.
684000	686000	Huangjialue is probably the first book.
686000	688000	However,
688000	690000	this book
690000	692000	was written in France.
692000	694000	Secondly,
694000	696000	it was not executed.
696000	698000	In fact,
698000	700000	it was not widely promoted.
700000	702000	And is it written by Huangjialue?
702000	704000	There is still some controversy.
704000	706000	So I won't talk about it here.
706000	708000	I will focus on the research of
708000	710000	Western missionary language.
710000	712000	The second book
712000	714000	is probably the book
714000	716000	that has become the conclusion
716000	718000	over the past few years,
718000	720000	which is the book
720000	722000	of Wei Kuanguo's Chinese Literature.
722000	724000	This book is written in Latin.
724000	726000	It was written in Latin
726000	728000	until the beginning of the 20th century.
728000	730000	Of course,
730000	732000	it is now in English.
732000	734000	So almost all the early
734000	736000	letters in the church
736000	738000	are probably written in Latin.
738000	740000	He wrote this book
740000	742000	in Chinese.
742000	744000	This book is
744000	746000	circulated in the form of a manuscript.
746000	748000	His manuscript
748000	750000	still exists
750000	752000	in several versions.
752000	754000	Several libraries
754000	756000	in the church still have it.
756000	758000	One of the characteristics of this book
758000	760000	is that it discusses grammar
760000	762000	in the second and third chapters,
762000	764000	and for the first time
764000	766000	makes the difference between Chinese and Latin.
766000	768000	The difference between Latin and Chinese.
768000	770000	He also found that the characteristics of Chinese
770000	772000	are that there is no gender.
772000	774000	There is no gender.
774000	776000	There is no gender.
776000	778000	There is no
778000	780000	gender.
780000	782000	There is no gender.
782000	784000	Let's take a look.
784000	786000	There is another book.
786000	788000	Ten years ago,
788000	790000	it was discussed
790000	792000	that Ji Wanguo's Chinese Guanhua Grammar.
792000	794000	This book is
794000	796000	the earliest
796000	798000	widely printed
798000	800000	grammar book.
800000	802000	It was also
802000	804000	a very popular
804000	806000	grammar book
806000	808000	in the 18th and 19th centuries.
808000	810000	What has a deeper impact
810000	812000	is the Chinese Zha Ji
812000	814000	written by Ma Ruose.
814000	816000	One of the characteristics of this book
816000	818000	is that the book was written
818000	820000	in 1728.
820000	822000	He had already first
822000	824000	studied the grammar of
824000	826000	Chinese and Latin.
826000	828000	In addition,
828000	830000	in the analysis of the grammar of Chinese and Latin,
830000	832000	the sentences he used
832000	834000	were a large number of sentences
834000	836000	quoted in the novel
836000	838000	.
838000	840000	At the same time, he noticed that
840000	842000	the words were divided into
842000	844000	real words and imaginary words.
844000	846000	He kept some local dialects.
846000	848000	For example,
848000	850000	when he quoted the Water Tiger Diamond,
850000	852000	he used a large number of Shandong dialects.
852000	854000	It is a historical
854000	856000	language
856000	858000	presentation.
858000	860000	It is a very real
860000	862000	grammar book.
862000	864000	Next,
864000	866000	let's talk about the impact of this book.
866000	868000	This impact is very direct.
868000	870000	We are all very familiar with
870000	872000	the first Chinese grammar book
872000	874000	written by Ma Ruose.
874000	876000	The author of Ma Ruose
876000	878000	is Ma Jianzhong.
878000	880000	It can be said that
880000	882000	Ma Jianzhong's writing of Ma Ruose
882000	884000	was influenced by the grammar book
884000	886000	of the Western missionary.
886000	888000	Let's take a look.
888000	890000	Ma Jianzhong himself was from Zhejiang.
890000	892000	At that time, he was called Dan Tu.
892000	894000	Dan Tu is the name of a school
894000	896000	in Xuhui, Shanghai.
896000	898000	If you are from Taiwan,
898000	900000	you probably know that
900000	902000	Xuhui High School
902000	904000	is the name of a school
904000	906000	in Luzhou,
906000	908000	Xinbei City.
908000	910000	That's right.
910000	912000	Xuhui High School
912000	914000	is the name of a school
914000	916000	in Xuhui, Shanghai.
916000	918000	It is a middle school
918000	920000	established by
920000	922000	Ma Jianzhong
922000	924000	in Xuhui.
924000	926000	At that time,
926000	928000	Ma Jianzhong was also
928000	930000	a member of Xuhui.
930000	932000	He was very familiar
932000	934000	with these French priests.
934000	936000	He studied Latin grammar
936000	938000	and wrote a book called
938000	940000	Ma Shi Wen Tong.
940000	942000	It is worth mentioning that
942000	944000	Ma Jianzhong's family
944000	946000	was Catholic.
946000	948000	He had a very famous brother
948000	950000	who later became a monk.
950000	952000	He was the founder
952000	954000	of Furen University
954000	956000	in Beijing.
956000	958000	Ma Jianzhong
958000	960000	was also a representative
960000	962000	from Europe.
962000	964000	Ma Shi Wen Tong
964000	966000	studied Chinese grammar
966000	968000	in a thorough way.
968000	970000	He wrote a lot of books
970000	972000	about the grammar of words.
972000	974000	He did a thorough research.
974000	976000	Ma Shi Wen Tong's book
976000	978000	was very helpful
978000	980000	in modern Chinese grammar
980000	982000	study.
982000	984000	It was influenced
984000	986000	by Zhang Shizhao's
986000	988000	Middle Chinese Dictionary,
988000	990000	Li Jingxi's
990000	992000	New Chinese Grammar,
992000	994000	Lu Shuxiang's
994000	996000	and Wang Li's works.
996000	998000	Next,
998000	1000000	I would like to compare
1000000	1002000	the analysis
1002000	1004000	of the vocabulary
1004000	1006000	of Ma Shi Wen Tong's book.
1006000	1008000	The first book
1008000	1010000	is Wei Kuanguo's
1010000	1012000	Chinese Grammar in 1651.
1012000	1014000	As you can see,
1014000	1016000	he divided Chinese vocabulary
1016000	1018000	into nine categories.
1018000	1020000	We are all very familiar with it.
1020000	1022000	Next,
1022000	1024000	Ma Shi Wen Tong's Chinese Dictionary
1024000	1026000	has six categories.
1026000	1028000	What is special
1028000	1030000	is that
1030000	1032000	Wei Kuanguo
1032000	1034000	classified the Chinese vocabulary
1034000	1036000	into nouns.
1036000	1038000	The Chinese Dictionary
1038000	1040000	classified the Chinese vocabulary
1040000	1042000	into nouns.
1042000	1044000	Ma Shi Wen Tong
1044000	1046000	classified the Chinese vocabulary
1046000	1048000	into nouns.
1048000	1050000	He classified the Chinese vocabulary
1050000	1052000	into subordinate words.
1052000	1054000	He studied the subordinate words separately.
1054000	1056000	Let's look at
1056000	1058000	the book
1058000	1060000	which has become
1060000	1062000	Lu Shuxiang's
1062000	1064000	Chinese Dictionary
1064000	1066000	in the early 1980s.
1066000	1068000	He classified the Chinese vocabulary
1068000	1070000	into twelve categories.
1070000	1072000	He added the subordinate words
1072000	1074000	and the subordinate words.
1074000	1076000	We can see
1076000	1078000	that the Chinese Dictionary
1078000	1080000	which has been classified
1080000	1082000	for more than 300 years
1082000	1084000	is still based on
1084000	1086000	the earliest Chinese Dictionary
1086000	1088000	in 1651.
1088000	1090000	The third factor
1090000	1092000	is the appearance
1092000	1094000	of Chinese alphabets.
1094000	1096000	We all know that
1096000	1098000	the traditional Chinese alphabets
1098000	1100000	are pronounced in the opposite way.
1100000	1102000	They are pronounced
1102000	1104000	in the opposite way
1104000	1106000	in Chinese characters.
1106000	1108000	They are pronounced in the opposite way
1108000	1110000	in Chinese characters.
1110000	1112000	This is the way
1112000	1114000	Chinese alphabets have been used
1114000	1116000	for a long time.
1116000	1118000	The Chinese alphabets
1118000	1120000	are classified into
1120000	1122000	the subordinate words
1122000	1124000	and the subordinate words.
1124000	1126000	Therefore,
1126000	1128000	it is very difficult
1128000	1130000	for a native speaker
1130000	1132000	to learn Chinese alphabets
1132000	1134000	or a non-native speaker
1134000	1136000	to learn Chinese alphabets.
1136000	1138000	After Li Maodou
1138000	1140000	came to China,
1140000	1142000	he first tried to
1142000	1144000	pronounce Chinese alphabets
1144000	1146000	but he failed.
1146000	1148000	On the one hand,
1148000	1150000	the Chinese alphabets
1150000	1152000	were changed
1152000	1154000	from the Ming Dynasty
1154000	1156000	to the Qing Dynasty.
1156000	1158000	At that time,
1158000	1160000	the Chinese alphabets
1160000	1162000	were introduced
1162000	1164000	from the south to China.
1164000	1166000	In addition to the dialects
1166000	1168000	of Guangdong,
1168000	1170000	the Chinese alphabets
1170000	1172000	were introduced
1172000	1174000	from the north to the south.
1174000	1176000	At that time,
1176000	1178000	the official language of Guangdong
1178000	1180000	was Manchurian.
1180000	1182000	Therefore,
1182000	1184000	the Chinese alphabets
1184000	1186000	were studied
1186000	1188000	in different regions.
1188000	1190000	The next one
1190000	1192000	is a heavy-weighted work,
1192000	1194000	which is
1194000	1196000	the work of
1196000	1198000	the father of
1198000	1200000	Genghis Khan.
1200000	1202000	He studied the books
1202000	1204000	of the Ming Dynasty
1204000	1206000	and translated the Chinese alphabets
1206000	1208000	into
1208000	1210000	the Western
1210000	1212000	alphabets.
1212000	1214000	He only used
1214000	1216000	25 alphabets
1216000	1218000	and 5 tones.
1218000	1220000	At that time,
1220000	1222000	the 5 tones
1222000	1224000	included the Chinese alphabets
1224000	1226000	so there was one more tone
1226000	1228000	than now.
1228000	1230000	Now,
1230000	1232000	let's look at
1232000	1234000	the Chinese alphabets.
1234000	1236000	This is the
1236000	1238000	Chinese alphabet
1238000	1240000	of Sirurmuz.
1240000	1242000	Although it is not clear,
1242000	1244000	it is presented
1244000	1246000	in a compass-shaped way.
1246000	1248000	The Chinese alphabets
1248000	1250000	were translated
1250000	1252000	in the way of
1252000	1254000	putting the sound
1254000	1256000	inside and
1256000	1258000	out.
1260000	1262000	Let's continue
1262000	1264000	to look at
1264000	1266000	how the Chinese alphabets
1266000	1268000	of Sirurmuz
1268000	1270000	influenced the development
1270000	1272000	of Chinese alphabets.
1272000	1274000	Sirurmuz's significance
1274000	1276000	is that
1276000	1278000	using Latin alphabets
1278000	1280000	to analyze Chinese alphabets
1280000	1282000	has always been
1282000	1284000	seen as a complicated
1284000	1286000	and difficult task.
1286000	1288000	It has a great impact
1288000	1290000	on the later
1290000	1292000	Chinese alphabets
1292000	1294000	such as Sirurmuz,
1294000	1296000	Sirurmuz,
1296000	1298000	Sirurmuz,
1298000	1300000	Sirurmuz,
1300000	1302000	Sirurmuz,
1302000	1304000	Sirurmuz,
1304000	1306000	Sirurmuz,
1306000	1308000	Sirurmuz,
1308000	1310000	Sirurmuz,
1310000	1312000	Sirurmuz,
1312960	1314960	Latin and Romance alphabets
1314960	1316960	had a big impact
1316960	1318960	on the success
1318960	1320960	of cutting alphabets
1320960	1322960	of Chinese alphabets.
1322960	1324960	Eulius Dirich,
1324960	1326960	the pope who came from
1328960	1328960	
1328960	1330960	in the middle of the 19th century
1332960	1334160	was an American
1334160	1334960	who studied Chinese 싶은
1334960	1336000	We know that
1336000	1337760	Chinese characters are hard to learn.
1337760	1339760	He felt that
1339760	1341700	Chinese characters were
1341700	1343700	unreasonable.
1343700	1345700	So he wrote a paper
1345700	1347700	in the Chinese Newspaper
1347700	1349700	and he was the first to argue
1349700	1351700	that Chinese characters should
1351700	1353700	be replaced by Pinyin.
1353700	1355700	The reason he argued
1355700	1357700	was very intense.
1357700	1359700	First, he thought
1359700	1361700	that an excellent language
1361700	1363700	should be Pinyin.
1363700	1365700	He even said that
1365700	1367700	alphabets,
1367700	1369700	such as the Egyptian alphabet,
1369700	1371700	should be replaced by Pinyin.
1371700	1373700	He felt that
1373700	1375700	Chinese characters should be
1375700	1377700	eliminated from the
1377700	1379700	progress of language.
1379700	1381700	He also suggested
1381700	1383700	that Chinese characters
1383700	1385700	should be replaced
1385700	1387700	by Pinyin.
1387700	1389700	He said that
1389700	1391700	Chinese characters
1391700	1393700	are hard to learn.
1393700	1395700	Chinese children
1395700	1397700	should learn
1397700	1399700	because
1399700	1401700	Chinese characters
1401700	1403700	are hard to learn.
1403700	1405700	Wei Sanwei
1405700	1407700	agreed with this argument.
1407700	1409700	He continued to
1409700	1411700	argue in the Chinese Newspaper.
1411700	1413700	At the beginning of
1413700	1415700	the Qing Dynasty,
1415700	1417700	there were many
1417700	1419700	intellectuals
1419700	1421700	who recognized
1421700	1423700	the old China.
1423700	1425700	For example, Xuantong, Chen Duxiu,
1425700	1427700	etc.
1427700	1429700	Even Hu Shi
1429700	1431700	said that
1431700	1433700	Chinese characters
1433700	1435700	should be replaced
1435700	1437700	by Pinyin.
1437700	1439700	This led to
1439700	1441700	the famous
1441700	1443700	Chinese-Latin movement
1443700	1445700	in the early years of the Republic of China.
1445700	1447700	Of course,
1447700	1449700	the Chinese-Latin movement
1449700	1451700	did not succeed
1451700	1453700	in 2021.
1453700	1455700	Because there are too many dialects in China,
1455700	1457700	there is no way
1457700	1459700	to use one Pinyin
1459700	1461700	to represent all dialects.
1461700	1463700	Second,
1463700	1465700	there are too many homonyms in China.
1465700	1467700	In addition, there is a difference
1467700	1469700	between spoken Chinese and spoken Chinese.
1469700	1471700	Without Chinese characters,
1471700	1473700	there is no way
1473700	1475700	to express it correctly.
1475700	1477700	So Pinyin
1477700	1479700	did not replace Chinese characters.
1479700	1481700	However,
1481700	1483700	Chinese characters
1483700	1485700	were replaced by Pinyin
1485700	1487700	in the 18th century.
1487700	1489700	This is directly
1489700	1491700	due to the influence
1491700	1493700	of the Roman Pinyin
1493700	1495700	of the Western missionary.
1495700	1497700	Fourth,
1497700	1499700	missionary Chinese
1499700	1501700	has also improved
1501700	1503700	the status
1503700	1505700	of traditional Chinese literature.
1505700	1507700	Chinese literature
1507700	1509700	has always been
1509700	1511700	about poetry.
1511700	1513700	Poetry
1513700	1515700	can not be counted.
1515700	1517700	However,
1517700	1519700	the novelist
1519700	1521700	has always been
1521700	1523700	compared to the literati.
1523700	1525700	From the Chinese characters,
1525700	1527700	the author said
1527700	1529700	that the novelist Liu
1529700	1531700	is a hearsay.
1531700	1533700	He is not as good as Liu.
1533700	1535700	This idea
1535700	1537700	has been
1537700	1539700	passed down
1539700	1541700	from generation to generation.
1541700	1543700	The author did not
1543700	1545700	accept the novel.
1545700	1547700	He did not accept the novel
1547700	1549700	of Zhang Hui.
1549700	1551700	He accepted the short stories
1551700	1553700	of the literary world.
1553700	1555700	However,
1555700	1557700	he did not accept the four great novels.
1557700	1559700	Why?
1559700	1561700	Because he felt that the four great novels
1561700	1563700	were very vulgar.
1563700	1565700	However,
1565700	1567700	after the Western missionary
1567700	1569700	came to China,
1569700	1571700	he made a big change.
1571700	1573700	In French literature,
1573700	1575700	novels and plays
1575700	1577700	are very important.
1577700	1579700	The Chinese literature of France
1579700	1581700	started to pay attention
1581700	1583700	to Chinese novels and plays
1583700	1585700	very early on.
1585700	1587700	The missionary
1587700	1589700	also found that
1589700	1591700	the novels of Zhang Hui
1591700	1593700	and Baihua
1593700	1595700	were very rich in
1595700	1597700	folk customs
1597700	1599700	and life records.
1599700	1601700	Therefore,
1601700	1603700	the missionary
1603700	1605700	started to use
1605700	1607700	the novels of Zhang Hui
1607700	1609700	as a Chinese textbook.
1609700	1611700	In the book
1611700	1613700	of Ma Ruose,
1613700	1615700	he used the sentences
1615700	1617700	of the novels of Zhang Hui
1617700	1619700	as an example.
1619700	1621700	Let's take a look
1621700	1623700	at the book of Ma Ruose.
1623700	1625700	The French priest
1625700	1627700	of the Jesuit Church
1627700	1629700	named Andre Gaulle
1629700	1631700	translated the book
1631700	1633700	of Ma Ruose
1633700	1635700	as a textbook.
1635700	1637700	He translated
1637700	1639700	the book of Ma Ruose
1639700	1641700	as a textbook.
1641700	1643700	He translated the book
1643700	1645700	of Ma Ruose
1645700	1647700	as a textbook.
1647700	1649700	Ma Ruose
1649700	1651700	also translated
1651700	1653700	the book of Ma Ruose
1653700	1655700	as a textbook.
1655700	1657700	He translated the book

2427700	2429700	the question
2429700	2431700	of
2431700	2433700	Ning Shen.
2433700	2435700	Because
2435700	2437700	you mainly talk about
2437700	2439700	the missionaries from the West.
2439700	2441700	I'd like to know
2441700	2443700	how you define
2443700	2445700	the missionaries
2445700	2447700	from the West.
2447700	2449700	I'd like to know
2449700	2451700	how you define
2451700	2453700	the missionaries
2453700	2455700	from the West.
2455700	2457700	I know
2457700	2459700	some of them
2459700	2461700	are from different countries
2461700	2463700	and some of them
2463700	2465700	are from different countries
2465700	2467700	and some of them
2467700	2469700	are from different countries
2469700	2471700	and some of them
2471700	2473700	are from different countries
2473700	2475700	and some of them
2475700	2477700	have different accents
2477700	2479700	and accents.
2479700	2481700	Do you think
2481700	2483700	their analysis
2483700	2485700	of Chinese
2485700	2487700	has an impact?
2487700	2489700	Because, as you said,
2489700	2491700	their main purpose
2491700	2493700	is to preach.
2493700	2495700	Their main purpose
2495700	2497700	is to preach.
2497700	2499700	I talked about
2499700	2501700	their interpretation
2501700	2503700	of the Bible
2503700	2505700	to help them preach
2505700	2507700	and communicate.
2507700	2509700	But before that,
2509700	2511700	because the Chinese culture
2511700	2513700	and language
2513700	2515700	flowed into
2515700	2517700	Europe
2517700	2519700	and they
2519700	2521700	read written language
2521700	2523700	and read written language
2523700	2525700	instead of conversation.
2525700	2527700	instead of conversation.
2527700	2529700	I'd like to know
2529700	2531700	because...
2531700	2533700	What's my question?
2533700	2535700	Because their purpose
2535700	2537700	is different.
2537700	2539700	I'd like to know
2539700	2541700	if this has an impact
2541700	2543700	on their Chinese learning
2543700	2545700	and analysis.
2545700	2547700	If you want
2547700	2549700	to read literature
2549700	2551700	and analyze literature,
2551700	2553700	the emphasis is different.
2553700	2555700	Is there a mismatch?
2555700	2557700	Is there a mismatch?
2557700	2559700	Next,
2559700	2561700	as you mentioned,
2561700	2563700	they've been
2563700	2565700	learning Chinese
2565700	2567700	in different places
2567700	2569700	for a long time.
2569700	2571700	for a long time.
2571700	2573700	As you mentioned,
2573700	2575700	there's a Shandong dialect.
2575700	2577700	There's a Shandong dialect.
2577700	2579700	Francesco Varo,
2579700	2581700	a Spanish missionary,
2581700	2583700	he read
2583700	2585700	the White Paper
2585700	2587700	in 1728.
2587700	2589700	It's a Shandong dialect.
2589700	2591700	So, I'd like to know...
2591700	2593700	He read it in Shandong dialect.
2593700	2595700	He read it in Shandong dialect.
2595700	2597700	So, I'd like to know...
2597700	2599700	I'd like to know...
2599700	2601700	I'd like to know...
2601700	2603700	I'd like to know...
2603700	2605700	I'd like to know...
2605700	2607700	I'd like to know...
2607700	2609700	I'd like to know...
2609700	2611700	I'd like to know...
2611700	2613700	How does learning Chinese
2613700	2618700	affect their
2618700	2620700	Chinese learning?
2620700	2622700	How does learning Chinese
2622700	2624700	affect their
2624700	2626700	Korean learning?
