Sorry, let me see if I can play it

by me and Professor Chen

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Before you apply

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for a PhD

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
what can you

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
consider

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and what information

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
can you use

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to help you

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
decide

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
whether to

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
apply for

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
a PhD program

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
let's start

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
with the first part

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and then

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the second part

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Professor Chen

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
all the

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
audience

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
are interested

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in applying for

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
a PhD program

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you are

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
applying for a

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
master's program

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
or a

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
MBA

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
or any other

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
major

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it may be

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a little

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
different

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
let me

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
introduce myself

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My name is

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Chen

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am a

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
PhD student

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and I am

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
currently studying

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
at the

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
University of

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
San Francisco

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and I am

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
currently studying

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
at the

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
University of San Francisco

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In the

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
US, there is

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
no salary cap

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In the academic world

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
In Canada,

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it is more like

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the US

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but in many

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
European and American

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
countries

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
there is no

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
fixed salary

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is a

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
very important

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
part of

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
your career

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
For example,

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the vaccine against

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
COVID-19

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is a very important

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
part of your

172
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
career

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I hope that

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you can find

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
a better training

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and a better

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
way of teaching

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I hope that

179
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
you can

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
learn about leadership

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In addition to teaching

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and research, you can

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
develop your own

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
career

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I hope that

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you can

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
develop your own

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
career

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I hope that

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
develop your own

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
career

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to let them know

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We're about to start

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it this one?

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, so tell me if you still have a problem

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Anyway, I hope I made myself clear

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The point is, this is a soft voice

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Can you follow me?

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Another one

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Future direction

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Future direction

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's start with this

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What can you do in the future?

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm talking about social science

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
In social science, of course, you can go a long way

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Social science is, of course

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Except for academic position

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For example, research university

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Research type R1, R2

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Teaching type university

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The so-called Boya College

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Or community college

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Some people even do tenure track

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Non-tenure track job

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or even in college

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Some are research jobs

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Not so-called teaching

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But it's a pure research job

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Some term faculty

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Not tenure track

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In Taiwan

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The concept of so-called professional assistant

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Or there is a visiting professor

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Visiting students

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This teacher is also relatively

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Temporary

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Actual position

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's more like Taiwan's part-time

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Teaching one or two classes

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There is a part-time job in the academic world

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course there are more

238
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I'm roughly like this

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There are also other people who want to say

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to do academic work

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Some of my students say

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not interested in pure academic work

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But I hope to change the world

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or I hope to be able to

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They may go to the library

246
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Some students or friends

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Work in government agencies

248
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Whether it's the local government or the federal government

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like me

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
National Institute of Justice

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FBI

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Or local police

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Of course this part

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It depends on your identity

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Especially in the United States

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
For government work

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
A lot of people ask

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are at least a green card or a citizen

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is a way out

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Of course there are some non-research institutions

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Or some organizations

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example, some people want to go

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For example, criminal protection

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Related organizations

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Or even anti-human trafficking

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Anti-population transmission

267
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Like I have a lot of students

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In some different agencies

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But there is one thing

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to talk about

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So much good

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But also consider

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sometimes looking for a job after graduation

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Get a doctor's degree

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Does it help you find a job?

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This thing

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not necessarily

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why do you say that

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You may have to look at your future work

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Standards for the degree you need

281
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sometimes people work

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Especially if you are not in the academic world

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you work in the industry

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They are also worried about one thing

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Overqualification

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You have a doctor's degree

287
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But they only need a master's degree

288
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
At least in Europe and the United States

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sometimes they don't want you to have a master's degree

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
To find a job

291
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because on the one hand

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a part of the salary

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
On the other hand

294
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think it's a waste of money

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So maybe you can think about it first

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What is your future career outlook

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then think about it

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the way to go

299
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is it the most suitable way for you

300
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So now

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is Powerpoint moving?

302
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have it here

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
OK

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is what I said before

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
When I was talking to Professor Chen

306
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We are all curious about this

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I want to share something with you

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sometimes you come to the doctoral class

309
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Before you need to think about it

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why do you want to come to this doctoral class

311
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Why is this question important

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Because it's the doctoral class

313
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not like the master's class

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One or two years

315
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But when it comes to a doctor

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're looking for a job

317
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
People will worry about whether you will be highly educated

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And then you read the doctor

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
For you

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Some parts of the field become more open

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But the work part

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or some parts

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Sometimes it becomes narrower

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So you might want to think about it

325
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And the time and money you invest

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can think about it

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why do you want to read this doctoral class

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's because of your family's expectations

329
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your important others' expectations

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
People around you keep telling you

331
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're so smart not to read

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's a pity

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's because of other people's expectations

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Even the neighbors

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Who is so smart

336
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why don't you read a doctor

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is it because of this

338
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Or because you want to pursue self-fulfillment

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I just like to do research

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think this is my mission

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or you are very enthusiastic about a certain topic

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Like I might be a student

343
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Tell me when I was very young

344
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think this is very important

345
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is his passion

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then it is very clear

347
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Know which way you want to go

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Then this may be a

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Your internal motivation may be very important

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Or is it possible to read this

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I feel like I can do some work after reading the doctor

352
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It seems to be a social status

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It seems to feel like

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The income will be very stable and high

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But it's not like that

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Just like we said

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Although at least in the United States

358
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But at the same time

359
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That is to say

360
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The distribution is not very uniform

361
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
For example, it's not the same job

362
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Your payout will be the same

363
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So you may have to think about this

364
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you come to read

365
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's to feel like I'm a few years later

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Guaranteed to have a job

367
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Guaranteed to have a good salary

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There is no way

369
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So if it's so direct

370
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Or so practical

371
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You may consider

372
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Go to the way

373
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go to the way you want

374
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because especially now

375
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Everyone knows that Kobe is more serious

376
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In Taiwan

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The same job

378
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A lot of people are fighting

379
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is more serious in the United States

380
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like last year, we hired two people

381
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then we hired two people

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I seem to have received about 160 applications

383
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is for two jobs

384
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So this is actually very competitive now

385
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So you got a doctorate

386
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Guaranteed that you will definitely get a job

387
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So this thing is what you have to think about

388
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What is your motivation

389
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why did you come to read this thing

390
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Some people say I don't know what to read

391
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Especially Taiwan

392
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I have read

393
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know what to do

394
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Just keep reading

395
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is also an idea

396
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But maybe at some point

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Think about where your enthusiasm for the future is

398
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like I said here

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There is nothing right or wrong

400
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But maybe you have to ask yourself first

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What is your goal

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What kind of self-achievement do you want to achieve

403
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Another very important thing is

404
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Can you accept

405
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can you accept

406
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If this

407
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Walking back and forth

408
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The result is not what you imagined

409
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Can you bear such a result

410
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Then these are all

411
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I think these can be thought of first

412
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Not to hit you

413
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Not to make everyone feel that life is very pessimistic

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But I think you can think about it first

415
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If there is such a thing

416
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
More able to face

417
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When it comes to life

418
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Know that this is just a process

419
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is a process

420
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You may always kick a little stone on the road

421
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That doesn't mean

422
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What will it be

423
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But maybe think about it first

424
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I know

425
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you are more determined

426
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I think I can overcome this

427
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But if you don't have a very firm idea

428
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think I want to retreat

429
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Of course, the other part is

430
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's more practical to consider

431
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What is the price you need to pay

432
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Time to work hard

433
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Your money can face the future

434
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Uncertainty

435
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
After all, there is a lot of pressure

436
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can you do something good

437
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Can you finish reading within a certain period of time

438
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then usually this test is

439
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are often some low self-esteem

440
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The concept of low self-esteem

441
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why do you feel

442
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't seem to read fast

443
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
My presentation is not good

444
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
My grades are not good

445
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's easy to become

446
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Such a lost comparison

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And often there are setbacks

448
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Your first draft is accepted immediately

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then everyone goes to celebrate

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This time is too little

451
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you get R and R

452
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you can modify it

453
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You should put it aside

454
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You get the first draft

455
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can see right away

456
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Is to face

457
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
As we said at the beginning

458
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Of course there are benefits

459
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can learn some knowledge

460
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You have a lot of different life experiences

461
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Research experience

462
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Then you have some different skills

463
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Then your field of vision will be more open

464
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You will have some ideas of cross-cultural

465
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Even say you can meet some very cool people

466
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Great master

467
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You used to read in textbooks

468
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Maybe next to your office

469
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You can talk to him about some research questions

470
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But we can't just talk about the good side

471
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Then don't talk about that

472
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't talk about some negative parts

473
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Jump to the next part

474
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I want to ask

475
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want to add here?

476
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
For students

477
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That is to come

478
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That is to come

479
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Some of the parts I want to add

480
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No, I think the teacher said very well

481
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Please continue

482
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then I will continue to finish

483
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I will leave it to you

484
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That is

485
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If you want to play this thing

486
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Still feel very firm

487
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I want to go to the institute

488
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Of course the first part is

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You have to find a school

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Which school is suitable for you

491
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Or I said which school

492
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
In the institute

493
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Doctoral class is more specific

494
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's not the part of the school

495
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Which is

496
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Which department

497
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is suitable for you

498
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So we will put that program

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
At the front

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think the program should be compared to the school

501
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is

502
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The rank is more priority

503
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Because after all

504
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No matter how good the school

505
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
For example, some schools like Harvard

506
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Maybe some departments are very good

507
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Some departments are not so good

508
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So it's not that the better the school, the better the department

509
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Then I myself

510
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I will put the program

511
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Is able to provide

512
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Even the ranking program content

513
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
At the top

514
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Then you have to see if this department is suitable for your field of study

515
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Is it possible to provide the necessary resources

516
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
For example

517
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Is there a teacher in the department

518
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Or the lab is special

519
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
In the part you want to study

520
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because you have to read the doctor

521
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Basically there should be some

522
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The field you want to understand

523
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But that doesn't mean you can't change it in the future

524
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Cross-field or transfer field

525
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Because I have transferred to the field

526
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But this part needs to be understood first

527
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you are very interested

528
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That is to find the program

529
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's important to have a professor you want to work with

530
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How to choose a good school

531
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Of course

532
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Carnegie is the

533
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Commission of Higher Education

534
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
There are R1, R2 and D

535
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There are many kinds

536
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I only list those who can get a doctorate

537
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Of course the first one is

538
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
R1 is very high

539
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Respect

540
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Focus

541
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
On the research part

542
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Usually the teacher's teaching burden is relatively low

543
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Usually 1,2 or 2,2

544
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
One semester, one door, one semester, two doors

545
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
R2

546
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Also focus on research

547
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But also focus on teaching

548
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The teacher's teaching burden here is usually bigger

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But I still hope

550
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The teacher can do a good job

551
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But this part becomes

552
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because the teacher's teaching burden is slightly higher

553
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So usually it can be divided into research time

554
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Not necessarily so much

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
D and P

556
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Some professional schools

557
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
For example

558
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
For example, the Department of Physical Medicine

559
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Or

560
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Not reading PhD

561
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Psychology

562
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's different

563
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is a more professional degree

564
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But be careful

565
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you want to get a professional degree

566
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
A lot of times

567
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They will ask you to get a PhD

568
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Not a professional doctor

569
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There will be some differences

570
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Because the requirements are different

571
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The evaluation method is not the same

572
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
When it comes to choosing a program

573
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If the program is similar

574
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Still have to look back at the school

575
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Because the better the school's ranking

576
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The better its resources

577
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It usually attracts more

578
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Different good students

579
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Overall reputation

580
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It still helps you in the future

581
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So when the program is similar

582
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Also consider the school's ranking

583
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then there are some

584
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
When you are considering

585
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Like for me

586
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
There was a very northern school in New York

587
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
A very southern school in Florida

588
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought it was too cold and too hot

589
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I went to Maryland to study

590
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is for you

591
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Geographic location is important

592
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If you think about going back to Taiwan

593
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's convenient

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
University is also an advantage

595
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Not only can you fly directly to Taiwan

596
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Another point is

597
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you need to work

598
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Easy to travel

599
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The convenience of travel

600
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Is also a consideration for you

601
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Cost of living

602
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Is your living expenses

603
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have to consider

604
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Usually there will be scholarship

605
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But in a big city

606
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
General graduate scholarship

607
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You can't afford your life

608
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Maybe you have to make up for some

609
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But if you are in some

610
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Lower living expenses

611
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Many students I heard

612
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can still save some money

613
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So cost of living is also a consideration

614
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Opportunity

615
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
For example, my students

616
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
In DC

617
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We often have some opportunities

618
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We will do a state report

619
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Report to the members of the state

620
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We are in crime prevention policy

621
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Research results

622
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We have a better chance of getting along with them

623
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Or even to be an intern

624
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There will be more federal agencies

625
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Can do internship

626
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Or something

627
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Or after graduation

628
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like I have a student

629
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Before graduation

630
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Because it's close

631
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So this opportunity is also the future

632
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You may want to consider

633
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
For example, whether it is a long-term job

634
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Or some work experience

635
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Opportunity is also important

636
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Then there is the climate

637
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If the climate is for you

638
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Your comfort zone is not so big

639
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Or you want to experience a very different life

640
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Maybe you will choose

641
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Some regions have different climates

642
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The other one I want to tell you

643
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Usually

644
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You are in the doctor's class

645
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you want to find a school

646
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Maybe you have to do a little more homework

647
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because if you only look at

648
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Some of the schools you know

649
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sometimes you may have a sweat

650
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Many good schools

651
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Taiwanese may not know

652
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Like Vanderbilt, Emory Rice

653
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Maybe a lot of people know this school

654
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But relative to the so-called

655
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Some schools that everyone is familiar with

656
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They may not be so famous

657
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But they are in the professional field

658
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Or even in the United States

659
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Very distinguished

660
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So just do more homework

661
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
To understand your own field

662
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Instead of being influenced by the ranking of schools

663
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Known by Taiwanese

664
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because this may lose

665
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Some good opportunities

666
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Then the other one is

667
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So if you are not familiar with the school

668
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
How do you know

669
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The teachers here are good

670
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
How to do homework

671
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Look at every teacher

672
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Research experience

673
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Do they have a research plan

674
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Or their field of research

675
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
These are all very important

676
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I hope everyone is in

677
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
These parts have to be considered

678
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Which ones do you need

679
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
To do the assessment

680
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
OK

681
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll put this part first

682
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Professor Chen

683
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Professor Chen, I can help you

684
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's ask Professor Chen

685
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
When you have considered all these things

686
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
When you are ready to apply for a school

687
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
How do you do this preparation

688
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And what needs

689
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Professor Chen can also add

690
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OK

691
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Can you hear me

692
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
All right

693
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So now on the slide

694
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Basically you are preparing

695
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
During the application

696
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Will experience several

697
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Specific process

698
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
When everyone was preparing at the beginning

699
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
First prepare some

700
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
English test

701
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Then when you are ready

702
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
After the English test

703
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not bad

704
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The second thing is to prepare

705
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
To find the program you want to apply for

706
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Or the school you want to apply for

707
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Basically I suggest

708
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Don't look too much at once

709
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Use 5 plus

710
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
As a target

711
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Find the corresponding information

712
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I will give you an example later

713
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Can let you see

714
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How to go through these processes

715
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
In the application process

716
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You also have to prepare a lot

717
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Your

718
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Track record document

719
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
For example, your results

720
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
For example, your CV preparation

721
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
At this time

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I suggest everyone

723
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The earlier the better

724
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Then there will be a very important

725
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Two documents

726
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
My personal feeling is

727
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
After being

728
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Graduate Search Committee

729
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think

730
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
When reviewing abroad

731
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Review in the United States

732
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
When studying abroad

733
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Your Statement of Purpose

734
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
With Recognition Letter

735
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Are the two most important

736
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And the most decisive

737
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Document

738
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
To decide if you will be admitted

739
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
When you prepare all these documents

740
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You can go online

741
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Then go online application

742
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Basically this process

743
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No matter which field you are

744
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Will not change much

745
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Time

746
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The earlier the better

747
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you can come today

748
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Project Tara Webinar

749
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I believe to some extent

750
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You are more

751
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You prepare early enough

752
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You know where to find some useful information

753
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Next slide

754
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Next slide

755
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Step by step

756
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
How to prepare

757
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Be careful

758
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Next slide

759
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because I am a chemistry teacher

760
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I am in

761
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Houston

762
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Use our application

763
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
To make an example

764
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Let everyone know

765
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
When you want to do this

766
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Where to look for information

767
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
When you identify

768
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
When you want to apply for a school

769
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
First to the school

770
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Top of the department

771
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Basically

772
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You will see a

773
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
PhD Program

774
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Then you can click in

775
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Now in our department

776
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
There is a Apply Now

777
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If you click in

778
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It will tell you

779
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
All kinds of application information

780
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
With basic requirements

781
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
you need

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
After going in

784
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Usually some documents

785
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You can't do much

786
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Modification

787
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
How are you before

788
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Now is the time to arrange

789
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The most basic document

790
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Includes your

791
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
University or master's degree

792
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Certificate

793
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Next is your result sheet

794
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Next is your CV

795
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
These three documents

796
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Basically you can't think too much

797
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Especially your certificate

798
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And the result sheet

799
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You only need

800
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
To go to the school

801
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Department

802
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Apply for these things

803
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
After applying

804
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You have to spend

805
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Some time

806
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
With the school

807
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I believe there are some

808
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Help college students write their CV

809
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Some institutions

810
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
At this time

811
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I would suggest everyone to look for it

812
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And use these resources

813
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
To write your CV

814
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
To attract people

815
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Basically this thing

816
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You can't think too much

817
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
About your CV

818
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you can make it clear

819
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Simple is the best

820
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But basically

821
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There are not many things you can do

822
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Next is your English test

823
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
English test

824
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Basically what everyone sees

825
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If you are in the United States

826
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Basically

827
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
One is TOEFL

828
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
One is GRE

829
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
More and more schools

830
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Especially

831
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Research Institute

832
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think

833
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
People don't look at GRE

834
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Many schools include

835
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
UH

836
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Medical Center

837
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
RISE

838
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Basically in the next year

839
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They didn't ask for GRE

840
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Graduation

841
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So I think

842
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
At this stage

843
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I guess more and more schools

844
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Provide

845
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This kind of convenience

846
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is because

847
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Everyone wants to recruit good international students

848
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Many international students

849
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
They look very outstanding in all aspects

850
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But on GRE

851
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They can't pass the threshold

852
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That will cause a lot of sweat

853
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
In foreign schools

854
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If you look at the results of GRE

855
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And the performance of students in the course

856
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Basically

857
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There is no connection

858
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So more and more schools are pushing

859
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Abolish GRE

860
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So

861
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
If you don't know

862
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you want to apply for a school

863
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
GRE is necessary

864
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Then I would suggest

865
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Go to their website

866
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Look at their latest

867
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Certificate

868
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
On the other hand

869
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I think GRE is a

870
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Very important

871
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
English test

872
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because

873
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
If you go to

874
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Tier 1 school

875
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Basically

876
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
There will be enough support

877
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
For students' salary

878
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
They provide you

879
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Financial support

880
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Basically ask you to be a TA

881
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
TA is the so-called

882
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Your main job is

883
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You must

884
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Communicate with

885
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Undergraduate students

886
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You are a TA

887
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You must have good enough

888
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
English expression ability

889
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
To help

890
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
University students study

891
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So GRE is usually

892
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There is no way

893
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Every school

894
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Requirements for GRE

895
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think there has been a gradual rise in trends in recent years

896
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So when you are preparing

897
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I would suggest

898
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Put more effort on TOEFL

899
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
GRE, I think

900
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
As expected

901
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Maybe in the future

902
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
There will be fewer and fewer schools requiring GRE

903
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Next slide

904
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
OK

905
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This is

906
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
When you enter

907
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
After entering our website

908
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Every school

909
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
There will be a

910
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Frequently asked question

911
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The students will

912
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Always provide questions

913
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Usually in that part

914
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You will see

915
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The department will provide

916
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Very specific standards

917
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This is before

918
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Revealed on our department website

919
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
GRE is still a

920
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Required document

921
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
On their

922
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
On our website

923
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It will provide

924
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Basically we must meet these requirements

925
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
For example, how many points do you need for TOEFL

926
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
How many points do you need for GRE

927
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You are qualified

928
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Enter

929
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Graduate Search Committee to review

930
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Otherwise the school will directly

931
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Block your file

932
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You don't even have the right to be reviewed

933
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So

934
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Everyone must know when applying

935
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Are you in line with these

936
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Requirements

937
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Otherwise your application will be a mess

938
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
There is no way to be reviewed

939
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Alright

940
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Next slide please

941
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
OK

942
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Next we are going to talk about

943
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The most important document

944
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's called Statement of Purpose

945
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
When I was young

946
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
When applying for school

947
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
When I was writing the Statement of Purpose

948
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I didn't know what to write

949
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So I just wrote it

950
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
When I

951
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
After so many years

952
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
As a committee member

953
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
After so many years

954
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I summarized

955
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
A good Statement of Purpose

956
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Should include

957
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Several elements

958
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The first element

959
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I think it's motivation

960
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Basically it means

961
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Why do you want to apply

962
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Your Statement of Purpose

963
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The second element

964
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You have to

965
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Honestly discuss

966
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Your GPA

967
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The third element

968
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You have to discuss

969
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Do you have any research experience

970
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You can see

971
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I wrote leadership

972
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Leadership basically means

973
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Have you ever

974
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Worked with others

975
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OK

976
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The last one is research interest

977
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
OK

978
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
When you apply for school

979
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think research interest

980
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Very important

981
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Because you have to

982
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Log into their website

983
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Find your own interesting teacher

984
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So every school will be different

985
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You can't use the same

986
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Statement of Purpose

987
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
To vote for all schools

988
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
OK

989
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
If that's what you plan to do

990
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Basically

991
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I personally feel

992
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It will be lower

993
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
OK

994
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's go back to the beginning

995
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Let's talk about

996
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
In these five elements

997
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What should you write

998
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Like the first one

999
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Motivation

1000
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I think it goes back to what Professor Yang said

1001
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You have to think carefully

1002
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Why do you want to take a PhD

1003
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK

1004
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Of course you can't write

1005
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I just have nothing to do

1006
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Not a strong

1007
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Reasoning

1008
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So everyone

1009
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Why at the beginning

1010
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Professor Yang

1011
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I hope everyone can think about it

1012
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Why do I want to apply for a PhD

1013
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OK

1014
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Because in your Statement of Purpose

1015
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Basically your beginning

1016
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Will be a very important element

1017
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK

1018
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The second one I wrote

1019
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The main reason I wrote this is because

1020
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
When you are in elementary school

1021
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
OK

1022
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Very few students can be in

1023
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Keep a good GPA for eight semesters

1024
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
OK

1025
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I take myself as an example

1026
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
When I was young

1027
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Especially when I was in freshman year

1028
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
OK

1029
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm not a student who likes to study

1030
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
OK

1031
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
My GPA is very, very bad

1032
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
OK

1033
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Then

1034
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's so bad that I feel

1035
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If I really wrote it casually at that time

1036
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I must not apply for school

1037
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
OK

1038
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
If you say

1039
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
If you have a similar situation

1040
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Maybe in your student life

1041
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
In college life

1042
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You may have one or two semesters

1043
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The GPA is very bad

1044
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Then you have to think carefully

1045
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
To make an explanation

1046
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Because if you don't make an explanation

1047
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
When the reviewer looks at your CV

1048
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Look at your SOP

1049
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I will start to think about it

1050
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
OK, why didn't this student explain

1051
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Why your grades were not good at that time

1052
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
OK

1053
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I take myself as an example

1054
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
When I was in college

1055
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
My grades in freshman year

1056
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
In our class is very bad

1057
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The last class

1058
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There may be 60 students in our class

1059
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I may rank around 50

1060
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
My GPA may only be more than 2

1061
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yes

1062
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But when I

1063
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
When I was in senior year

1064
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And when I was in freshman year

1065
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I may be the first or second in our class

1066
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So

1067
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
At that time you will find

1068
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
My case has become a relatively vague case

1069
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Because when I was discussing my GPA

1070
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I can say that when I was in freshman year

1071
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I actually don't know what I want to do

1072
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
OK

1073
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So I just

1074
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Find myself to relax

1075
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
OK

1076
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
When I realized that

1077
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Chemistry is my passion

1078
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And I decided to be a chemistry teacher

1079
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Things get wrong

1080
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Right

1081
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
This situation will be a very positive lead

1082
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
OK

1083
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
When you are discussing your GPA

1084
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
When the reviewer

1085
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Look at your

1086
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
SOP

1087
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
This is a big plus

1088
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
OK

1089
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The best idea is that you always

1090
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
If you don't have anything to say

1091
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That is very excellent

1092
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
In that case, you just need to list

1093
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What you have won

1094
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
OK

1095
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But I think GPA is a

1096
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Everyone must think about it

1097
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Explain why your GPA looks like this

1098
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Everyone

1099
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Put your GPA with what you want to do now

1100
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That is to apply for Ph.D.

1101
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
To make a link

1102
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
OK

1103
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
What else can help you add points

1104
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
This is the so-called research experience

1105
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
OK

1106
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Like me

1107
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I went abroad to study after finishing my master's degree

1108
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So when I was studying for my master's degree

1109
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
In fact, I have already

1110
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
For many

1111
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Common scientific instruments

1112
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Quite familiar

1113
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
There is such a research experience

1114
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This is a big plus

1115
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The reason is that the students who apply in the United States

1116
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
They basically

1117
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Apply for Ph.D. directly from the university

1118
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Ph.D.

1119
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is not popular in foreign countries

1120
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
OK

1121
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Because they apply for Ph.D. directly from the university

1122
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So many students actually don't have

1123
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Enough

1124
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Scientific training

1125
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If you say

1126
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You have done a lot of research

1127
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Then this time

1128
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Will be a big plus

1129
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Then you have to explain

1130
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What you know

1131
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
To prove

1132
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That this thing is

1133
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
On scientific training

1134
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Already have

1135
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Enough maturity

1136
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
OK

1137
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So if you have these

1138
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You have won some awards

1139
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You do some presentations

1140
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Or you publish some papers

1141
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
These will be big plus

1142
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Another point is

1143
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Leadership

1144
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
This thing is actually

1145
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Although the United States emphasizes heroism

1146
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But when we review

1147
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A Ph.D. student

1148
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We actually value more

1149
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Is this student

1150
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Culturable

1151
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Is it a talent

1152
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
OK

1153
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Can he be a team member

1154
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Can he

1155
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Cooperate with others

1156
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Complete a project

1157
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OK

1158
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But at the same time have their own unique insights

1159
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
OK

1160
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It sounds very

1161
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Contradictory

1162
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But in the end

1163
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
When you become a Ph.D.

1164
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You must have so many different characteristics

1165
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
How to write

1166
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
To prove

1167
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Demonstrate you are a leader

1168
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The best

1169
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Example

1170
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you say

1171
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Volunteer experience

1172
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
OK

1173
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
For example, you may go to the hospital

1174
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Be an intern

1175
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Interact with people

1176
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
OK

1177
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What did you do

1178
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
For example

1179
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Because

1180
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You care about someone

1181
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You provide some advice

1182
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Solve something

1183
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This will be a good example

1184
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
OK

1185
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You can think about it

1186
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Is there a similar example in everyday life

1187
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
If not

1188
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
If your application time is still long

1189
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Try to find these opportunities

1190
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So you can write it in your SOP

1191
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
OK

1192
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The last one

1193
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I think it is also

1194
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Very important but also very time-consuming

1195
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
A component

1196
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You identify

1197
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Which lab

1198
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You are interested in

1199
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Obviously this thing

1200
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Must be done by every school

1201
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It will be very tiring

1202
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So if you do five schools

1203
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Must look at

1204
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
At least identify 15 faculties

1205
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But this thing will make your

1206
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
SOP

1207
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Very attractive

1208
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
OK

1209
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Especially when

1210
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The teacher you like

1211
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Is their department

1212
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Decide who can

1213
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Admit

1214
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Can decide

1215
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This time

1216
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It will be very very powerful

1217
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
OK

1218
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So I would suggest

1219
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Don't be lazy

1220
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Don't feel tired

1221
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Really just put

1222
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The teacher in the department

1223
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Find three

1224
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Now basically every teacher

1225
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Have their own website

1226
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So everyone just go in and take a look

1227
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I suggest you take a look at their latest paper

1228
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Don't find a paper

1229
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If you are going to do

1230
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
One of these things

1231
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I would suggest not to do this

1232
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Because the research ten years ago

1233
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It will be very different now

1234
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So just read

1235
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What they wrote on the website

1236
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Plus this one or two years of paper

1237
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's it

1238
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
In this case you will have enough

1239
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And profound understanding

1240
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
OK

1241
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And in this case

1242
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Even that

1243
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The teacher in the paper is not the teacher you are interested in

1244
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They are very likely to refer to

1245
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Those teachers you are interested in

1246
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
If those teachers think you qualify

1247
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Then you get the admission chance

1248
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Will be a big expert

1249
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
OK

1250
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I think this is the summary

1251
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
These key elements

1252
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For the study purpose

1253
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Next slide please

1254
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
OK

1255
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The last one is the so-called

1256
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Recommendation letter

1257
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This thing

1258
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I think in Taiwan

1259
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
With what I saw in the United States

1260
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The difference is very, very big

1261
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
OK

1262
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I think the big reason is because

1263
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
People don't usually talk to teachers

1264
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Relationship

1265
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
OK

1266
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So when you are a student

1267
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Or when I was a student

1268
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm actually very afraid of talking to teachers

1269
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
OK

1270
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
But when you go abroad

1271
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I think it's a very important document

1272
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
OK

1273
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
In Taiwan, my feeling now is

1274
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Teachers will teach students to write the draft of the recommendation letter first

1275
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And then they do some minor modifications

1276
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
OK

1277
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Usually when students do this

1278
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Basically

1279
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
May be very close to your deadline

1280
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
OK

1281
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
The teacher basically doesn't know you

1282
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You may be his student

1283
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You may perform very well

1284
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
He knows you

1285
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
He doesn't know who you are

1286
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
He doesn't really know who you are

1287
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
He doesn't know what you want to do

1288
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
He doesn't know what is your dream

1289
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
OK

1290
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
In this case

1291
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You draft the letter yourself

1292
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And then sign it to the teacher

1293
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And then the teacher sends it to us for review

1294
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The most common case is that we see this letter

1295
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
OK

1296
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
This letter

1297
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Very plain

1298
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
OK

1299
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And this letter

1300
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
This application document

1301
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Basically will be put into

1302
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Secondary pool

1303
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
OK

1304
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So when you want a recommendation letter

1305
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You don't want a plain letter

1306
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That doesn't help you

1307
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
OK

1308
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Sometimes it actually hurts you

1309
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
OK

1310
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
When we see a letter that says everything

1311
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But it seems like nothing is said

1312
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Then we will try to

1313
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Try to

1314
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Read between the lines

1315
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
OK

1316
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
When you see a lot

1317
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
When you save about one or two hundred minutes

1318
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You will know

1319
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The teacher doesn't really want to recommend you

1320
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If the teacher doesn't really want to recommend you

1321
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Then we have to follow the teacher's advice

1322
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Put you in

1323
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The category we don't like

1324
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
OK

1325
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So how do you prepare your recommendation letter?

1326
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The first is that you have to prepare early

1327
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
How early is early

1328
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Early until the teacher really knows you

1329
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
OK

1330
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
There are a lot of my students

1331
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
When they are in the second year

1332
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They start to talk to me

1333
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Start to discuss with me

1334
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
What they want to do

1335
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
OK

1336
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
When they are in the third or fourth year

1337
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
When they come to ask me for a letter

1338
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I totally know

1339
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What are the characteristics of this student

1340
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
OK

1341
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But there are students

1342
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Like this

1343
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I don't know this process

1344
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What kind of student

1345
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
He may be a month before the application

1346
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Come to ask me for a letter

1347
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
OK

1348
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The first one I don't know this student

1349
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Then the second

1350
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
A month for me

1351
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
For the teacher

1352
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Generally speaking

1353
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
For the professor

1354
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
A month is a very short time

1355
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
OK

1356
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
For the teacher

1357
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because it doesn't match

1358
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
OK

1359
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So I would suggest you

1360
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Once you decide to go abroad

1361
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You can start talking to the teacher

1362
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
OK

1363
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You need at least three teachers

1364
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Let them really know you

1365
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let them know

1366
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
What kind of student you are

1367
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
What are your strengths

1368
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
When you go to ask for a recommendation letter

1369
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
OK

1370
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Don't just say

1371
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Can you help me write a recommendation letter

1372
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
This is actually a very irresponsible approach

1373
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
The more appropriate approach is

1374
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OK

1375
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You have prepared your results

1376
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Prepare your CV

1377
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Prepare your SOP

1378
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
OK

1379
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
When you prepare all these documents

1380
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And then talk to the teacher

1381
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Believe me

1382
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The teacher will be moved by your sincerity

1383
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
OK

1384
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Then I would suggest

1385
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
When you really want to start

1386
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
When I want you to help me write a recommendation letter

1387
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's best to do it two months in advance

1388
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
OK

1389
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Basically, these documents must be prepared for the teacher

1390
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's possible that your SOP is not fully prepared

1391
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It doesn't matter

1392
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Just put a draft

1393
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
OK

1394
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Let the teacher know

1395
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
What do you think is the highlight of your life

1396
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
When the teacher sees it

1397
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Once the teacher knows what you are doing

1398
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Once the teacher knows you

1399
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
The teacher can play freely

1400
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
OK

1401
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So you have to provide enough information to the teacher

1402
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Give the teacher enough time

1403
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
OK

1404
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Of course, the sooner the better

1405
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
OK

1406
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The other thing is

1407
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
When the teacher agrees to help you write a recommendation letter

1408
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I would suggest everyone

1409
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
One week before due date

1410
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
If you find that the teacher has not sent out the recommendation letter

1411
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Give the teacher a reminder

1412
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
OK

1413
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
This is definitely a very appropriate action

1414
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So don't be shy

1415
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Think OK

1416
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I remind the teacher is a disrespectful behavior

1417
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
No, this is a responsible behavior

1418
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Because the teacher is sometimes too busy

1419
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
He will forget a lot of things

1420
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
OK

1421
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So don't be shy to remind the teacher

1422
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I would suggest everyone

1423
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
One week before due date

1424
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Send a reminder to the teacher

1425
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
OK

1426
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Next please

1427
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
OK

1428
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So we just talked about a lot of things

1429
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Right

1430
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
What makes you stand out

1431
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
OK

1432
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Usually everyone thinks

1433
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
GPA

1434
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
GRE

1435
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Of course these things are important

1436
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
OK

1437
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But I would say the importance of the English test

1438
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
For science students

1439
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think the importance is relatively low

1440
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
GPA is important

1441
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because GPA is our

1442
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The first criteria we use

1443
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
To cut off

1444
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Those not so great students

1445
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
OK

1446
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So if your GPA is not very good

1447
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Then you can

1448
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The only chance you can get

1449
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Admission

1450
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It comes from your SOP and your recommendation letters

1451
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
OK

1452
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
If those two are very strong

1453
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They will compete

1454
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Your GPA

1455
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
OK

1456
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
SOP is a very very very

1457
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Important document

1458
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
OK

1459
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It takes a lot of time to prepare

1460
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
OK

1461
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Recommendation letter

1462
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You have to let the teacher know you

1463
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
OK

1464
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Taiwan's current

1465
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Taiwan's current atmosphere

1466
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't think it's a very healthy atmosphere

1467
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Still a lot of

1468
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Teachers ask students to write

1469
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Draft

1470
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
This is actually not very good

1471
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
OK

1472
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I found that very few teachers do this

1473
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
OK

1474
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
All right

1475
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So I guess

1476
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
OK

1477
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So I guess

1478
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Spend time

1479
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
May be much longer than you think

1480
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because a lot of preparation

1481
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
In fact, it's not just you

1482
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
OK

1483
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You need the teacher's support

1484
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You need time

1485
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Put some key elements

1486
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Make it

1487
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
For example, you do research

1488
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
For example, you are an intern

1489
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
These things take time

1490
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So if you are now

1491
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
If you want to go abroad

1492
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Now you can probably start slowly

1493
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Be prepared

1494
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You won't feel so stressed

1495
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
OK, next

1496
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
OK, this is another

1497
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I think I agree with Mr. Yang

1498
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Is also a very

1499
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Effective way

1500
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
When you find a teacher

1501
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You really like it

1502
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like it so much

1503
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
If you don't go

1504
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Then I will suggest you

1505
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Try to contact the professor

1506
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
OK

1507
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Abroad

1508
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
From time to time

1509
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There will be students actively

1510
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Come to contact us

1511
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
This thing is actually very common

1512
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So when you do this

1513
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Don't think it's a

1514
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Very rare

1515
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Then you shouldn't do it

1516
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You should think about it

1517
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
This is a

1518
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Can fully show that you are

1519
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Actively looking for the right teacher

1520
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
A mode

1521
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
OK

1522
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
When you contact the teacher

1523
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Pay attention to

1524
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Make sure

1525
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Your tone is appropriate

1526
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
OK

1527
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Then

1528
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
When you

1529
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
When you write to the teacher

1530
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
In your

1531
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Email

1532
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Just introduce yourself

1533
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But remember to attach your SOP

1534
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Your CV and transcript

1535
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
This way the teacher will know

1536
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What is the level of this student

1537
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
He will decide

1538
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Do you want to continue to contact you

1539
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
OK

1540
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Of course doing this

1541
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It may be a useful way

1542
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
But it doesn't necessarily guarantee

1543
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You will get admission

1544
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
OK

1545
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
But I think it's worth a try

1546
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
OK

1547
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Next

1548
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OK

1549
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Financial support

1550
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
This is a very important thing

1551
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
If you want to apply

1552
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
School

1553
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Belongs to R1

1554
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
If you are a student

1555
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You don't have to worry about this

1556
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
OK

1557
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
In R1

1558
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Teachers usually

1559
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Will ask you to do TA or RA

1560
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
OK

1561
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I believe this part

1562
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
For R1

1563
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Not a problem

1564
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
But

1565
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Social science

1566
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I believe you have to think about it

1567
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
OK

1568
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I want to ask Professor Yang

1569
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
To add

1570
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
His thoughts

1571
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Thank you

1572
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Professor Chen

1573
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
This thing is basically

1574
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Like what Professor Chen said

1575
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The students of the science department

1576
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Because their resources are more abundant

1577
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Then the funding is more abundant

1578
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So in my experience

1579
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The science department

1580
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
If you are admitted to the doctor's class, you will definitely be paid

1581
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But social humanities

1582
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's not necessarily like this

1583
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
In the economy

1584
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Especially in the past few years

1585
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Because of the epidemic

1586
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
In fact, many schools

1587
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Funds are tight

1588
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Some schools

1589
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Will insist

1590
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
For example, a fixed fee

1591
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
In this case

1592
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Some schools

1593
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
If the number of people does not decrease

1594
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Or some schools do not have enough funding

1595
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He might say

1596
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
We will accept you

1597
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But we do not guarantee your funding

1598
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Do you want to come

1599
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Unfortunately, our social humanities

1600
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Sometimes the funding is not so abundant

1601
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
As I remember a few years ago

1602
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Our department is now

1603
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
We are in an interesting situation

1604
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Many teachers in our department are very successful

1605
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Get all kinds of research funding

1606
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This is a permanent

1607
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So permanent

1608
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
If it is a school or department

1609
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Long-term spending

1610
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We can write it on the offer letter

1611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Tell the student

1612
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
We provide you a few years of funding

1613
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But we have a plan

1614
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
For example, the three-year plan, the four-year plan

1615
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Because that plan is so-called non-permanent

1616
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So we can't write it on the letter

1617
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We can also contact the student

1618
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We have this opportunity

1619
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But we can't write it on the letter

1620
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
For example, our student

1621
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Older

1622
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Because he is married and has children

1623
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I remember he wrote a letter

1624
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
He said

1625
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You did not guarantee that we have funding

1626
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Do you know that I have a family and children

1627
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Don't you make it difficult for me

1628
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Although you are right

1629
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's also very sad

1630
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Sometimes there is this sad part

1631
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So I have to say

1632
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
If it's my own student

1633
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I give my own student advice

1634
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I think this is very important

1635
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Even I think this is the most important

1636
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
If there are two or three schools

1637
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
The ranking is almost the same

1638
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
If the other conditions are almost the same

1639
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Definitely consider going to a school that gives you funding

1640
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's not just about money

1641
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Of course there is funding

1642
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
For you

1643
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It's been so long

1644
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Your economic pressure will be much smaller

1645
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But it's not just about the economy

1646
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Another one is when you have funding

1647
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Especially you may have GRA

1648
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Or fellowship

1649
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Especially a graduate research assistant

1650
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It means you will be assigned to a teacher

1651
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
To help the teacher plan

1652
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Or even do research with the teacher

1653
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Relatively speaking, it means that there is a teacher

1654
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Will pay special attention to your progress

1655
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
For you

1656
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This is an opportunity to get along with the teacher

1657
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You can learn from the teacher

1658
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Usually you don't have funding

1659
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's not that you can't find a teacher to work with

1660
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But that one

1661
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
If you have this job opportunity

1662
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
The level you can understand

1663
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Will be much weaker

1664
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Even if it's a GTA

1665
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You can also

1666
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It should be to help my teacher

1667
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Teaching assistant

1668
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
For example, you can follow the class

1669
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Then see how the teacher teaches

1670
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You can also have a deep connection with the teacher

1671
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So no matter what I think

1672
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Financial support

1673
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I will put it with the student

1674
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I will put it in a very high priority

1675
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Unless for example

1676
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You don't need to think about it

1677
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
This is of course

1678
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You may still choose your dream school

1679
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But of course

1680
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
All the conditions are the same

1681
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I still recommend

1682
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Financial support school

1683
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
If it's the school's budget

1684
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Some schools give GRA

1685
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Some schools give fellowship

1686
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
GRA

1687
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I think it's best for students

1688
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Why is it best for students

1689
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Some school fellowships

1690
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
No compulsory

1691
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Of course it's a good thing

1692
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
When students have a high degree of autonomy

1693
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Or when students know what to do

1694
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You have the autonomy to follow the teacher

1695
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Who do I want to follow

1696
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You bring the research you want to do

1697
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Of course there is a gap in each department

1698
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But GRA

1699
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's basically you

1700
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
If you don't have a very clear direction

1701
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
In fact, it is a better start for students

1702
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Let you have some opportunities

1703
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Contact research work

1704
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
GRA is for

1705
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Language will be more demanding

1706
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Because you have to face the students directly

1707
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Then for example, take homework

1708
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Some courses you may have to bring

1709
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Or some parts you may need

1710
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
There is a group discussion time

1711
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
In terms of language

1712
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It becomes a very important thing

1713
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You have to be able to get in touch with students directly

1714
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That part is

1715
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I think it's good

1716
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
There are a lot of English students in Taiwan

1717
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's not bad

1718
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
After five years of teaching

1719
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
The experience of teaching again in the United States

1720
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Now Taiwanese students

1721
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
English is generally much better than when we were in college

1722
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So in terms of language

1723
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
But this is still a

1724
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Adapting process

1725
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So I mean if there is a choice

1726
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I will encourage students to choose GRA

1727
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If there is no choice, of course

1728
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It's really like this

1729
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Then of course

1730
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But this is your dream school

1731
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I have seen other students

1732
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
For example

1733
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Libraries also provide jobs

1734
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Even I have seen students

1735
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Work in the school's gym

1736
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Administrative office

1737
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Of course it's all for me

1738
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
If you want to study English

1739
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Or maybe it's a process

1740
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It's too much

1741
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Just waiting for you to find a chance

1742
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But if you really didn't

1743
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
If not

1744
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
This is also a

1745
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Out-of-the-box thinking

1746
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And of course

1747
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
In addition to the school

1748
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Since everyone is studying in Taiwan

1749
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I just want to go abroad

1750
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The Ministry of Science and Technology also provides scholarships abroad

1751
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The Ministry of Education also has the Ministry of Education

1752
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
A lot of scholarships

1753
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Like Fulbright

1754
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Or even if you are already studying in the United States

1755
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Then the school funding may be

1756
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Especially our social science

1757
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's often read to the end of the world

1758
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Even if the school guarantees you four or five years of funding

1759
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Maybe I'm still not enough

1760
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
The school also provides dissertation fellowship

1761
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Or some institutions like

1762
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The Ministry of Justice

1763
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Or NIH or something

1764
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
There will be a dissertation fellowship

1765
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
This can all be discussed with the teacher

1766
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You need the teacher to support you to apply

1767
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Then the teacher will usually be happy

1768
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
If you have a good idea

1769
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Then this will usually provide you

1770
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Not only your stipend

1771
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It will also provide you some research funding

1772
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So you can go

1773
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
If you can do your research well

1774
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
If you have such a dissertation fellowship

1775
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
In fact, it is also a bonus for you

1776
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It means you have a good experience

1777
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Your process

1778
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
In fact, your research has been

1779
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The evaluation is recognized

1780
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I think your achievements are good

1781
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So this is also a very good experience

1782
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
There are many other funding sources

1783
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I have suggested my students to apply

1784
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Like what female scientists

1785
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Some scholarship

1786
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That's not a lot

1787
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But in the process

1788
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
You can put it on your CV

1789
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Some experience

1790
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's a good thing to have this experience

1791
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
What you need to pay attention to

1792
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The eligibility requirements for each scholarship

1793
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Different

1794
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Like Fulbright, Monster

1795
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Education

1796
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
They all have requirements

1797
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
For example, two years of residency

1798
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
For example, especially Fulbright is quite strict

1799
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
When you get your degree

1800
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You need to go back to your motherland

1801
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Then do two years of service

1802
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Some of these things you need to understand

1803
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If it's like the United States

1804
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Government agencies

1805
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Some fellowships will require you to have a green card

1806
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
These things need to be read clearly

1807
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
What are the requirements for you

1808
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I hope the information you send

1809
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Do you meet

1810
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Even if you have GREGT

1811
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Sometimes you can also

1812
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
See if there are other funds

1813
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Can apply to help you

1814
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
In the process of learning

1815
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
For example, to supplement your research funding

1816
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Some of the costs of attending international conferences

1817
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
This is also a way to consider

1818
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Of course, the most important thing

1819
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
If you want to study for a doctorate

1820
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Usually when you apply for a fellowship

1821
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Because again, all humanities

1822
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's not so abundant

1823
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
If you get admission, it means you have money

1824
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's not the case

1825
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You have to hook

1826
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Do you want to be considered for funding

1827
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
This is very important

1828
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
This goes with what Professor Chen just said

1829
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Contact the teacher if the teacher has funding

1830
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
If the teacher thinks the research is suitable

1831
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
In addition to the teacher

1832
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I want to talk to the department

1833
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I think this student is good

1834
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
We can support him

1835
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
If the teacher has funding

1836
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
The first thing that comes to mind is

1837
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
This student, I have this plan now

1838
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Is it possible to find him to take this plan

1839
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Like before

1840
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
We received a student

1841
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
In fact, he did not get our department's funding

1842
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
He was very proactive

1843
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
He wrote very specific

1844
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Not a letter

1845
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Then he received a response

1846
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And very active

1847
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Can I schedule a virtual meeting with you

1848
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Now everyone is used to virtual meetings

1849
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It doesn't take a lot of time

1850
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I know there are several colleagues

1851
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Including me, I talked to him for half an hour

1852
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I know his experience is quite special

1853
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Sometimes I feel so active

1854
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You also hope that if there is a chance

1855
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Give him a chance to try

1856
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This Taiwanese student

1857
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I want to tell the students

1858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
In fact, especially in the United States

1859
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
In this cultural environment

1860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
If you take the initiative

1861
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
In fact, there is a benefit

1862
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Give you a chance to show yourself

1863
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Even give you a chance

1864
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Let others know you

1865
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
This is not a bad thing

1866
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Of course, it's not just writing an email

1867
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Talk to everyone casually

1868
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Of course you have to do this

1869
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Of course, be fully prepared

1870
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Practice well

1871
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
To do this kind of contact work

1872
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Then

1873
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So what should I say

1874
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Of course, I emphasize that I think

1875
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Financial support is very important

1876
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
But it doesn't mean

1877
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You didn't hear it at the beginning

1878
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
There will be no chance

1879
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Speaking of this, I think

1880
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's a very inspirational case

1881
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Just now

1882
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Mr. Chen said that his university hospital GPA is not very good

1883
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It doesn't matter

1884
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
My first, second, third, fourth GPA is not very good

1885
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So I had to study in a research institute

1886
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Study a master's degree

1887
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That master's degree, of course, is not bad

1888
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Turned to the field

1889
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I was a psychology major

1890
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Turned to criminal studies

1891
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You can say a lot

1892
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Why do I study this

1893
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I have my own internship experience

1894
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So it's not that

1895
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Master's degree is not an advantage

1896
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But that gives you a chance

1897
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Demonstrate your academic research

1898
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Because college students are usually

1899
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But you have a master's degree

1900
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You will have more food experience

1901
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Even research experience

1902
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
There may even be a master's thesis

1903
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
To support

1904
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You are not only potential

1905
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But you already have some performance

1906
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So this is also an idea

1907
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Then

1908
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
OK, wait a minute, I seem to jump

1909
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I don't like to jump to the front page

1910
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
That's probably

1911
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
A situation like this

1912
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Mr. Chen, are we

1913
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
If you have any questions

1914
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
If you have any questions

1915
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
If you want to discuss with us

1916
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Thank you for the two professors

1917
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The sharing is very

1918
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
A lot of details

1919
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Then we want to say

1920
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Wei Zhe has put it before

1921
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
The registration form

1922
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
If Wei Zhe has given us before

1923
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
We should all write

1924
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I have seen Wei Zhe before

1925
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Give me the list

1926
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
We should all write

1927
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
In our PowerPoint

1928
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Or is there anything we didn't mention

1929
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Or did you say that

1930
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I didn't notice

1931
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I think you've covered a lot of questions

1932
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's very detailed

1933
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Thank you

1934
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Thank you

1935
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Thank you

1936
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Thank you

1937
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Thank you

1938
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Thank you

1939
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Thank you

1940
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Thank you

1941
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Thank you

1942
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Thank you

1943
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Thank you

1944
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I think I've probably done it

1945
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So now

1946
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Is there anyone at the scene who has any questions?

1947
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If you feel embarrassed to ask

1948
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You are also welcome to

1949
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I or Yixuan

1950
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Or other staff you know

1951
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
We will help you

1952
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Ask the professor

1953
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Ok, wait

1954
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Mr. Chen

1955
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I have a question for you

1956
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
How do I

1957
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
How do I get to know you

1958
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
How do I get to know you

1959
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Ok, Tsingtao Materials

1960
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Ok

1961
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm from Tsingtao, so I'm good

1962
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Ok

1963
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So the first one is

1964
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
From a review point of view

1965
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Is it positive to have an internship at a company?

1966
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yes

1967
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But the point is

1968
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
If you have an internship somewhere

1969
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
It's useless

1970
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
The point is

1971
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Is there any story in your internship

1972
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You can tell

1973
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
In your SOP

1974
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
To reinforce

1975
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Reviewer's impression

1976
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You know you are a

1977
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
A person who can be a team worker

1978
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
When you are a team worker

1979
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
You can also show your leader's talent

1980
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
If there is such an article

1981
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's definitely a big plus

1982
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Is it constructive to let the teacher know you early?

1983
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yes

1984
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Usually I think

1985
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
More approachable

1986
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Step would be

1987
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
You find some

1988
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Classes that you think you are better at

1989
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Try to

1990
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Talk to the teacher

1991
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
In Taiwan

1992
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I don't know if everyone is used to

1993
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
When you are in class

1994
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Encounter some problems

1995
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Have you taken the initiative to find a teacher

1996
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
The habit of asking questions

1997
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
If not

1998
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
To

1999
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Start to develop this habit

2000
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Because I think this habit will let you

2001
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Improve very quickly in all aspects

2002
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Because when you have a chance

2003
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Talk to the teacher

2004
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
At the time

2005
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
You will know

2006
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
The teacher's idea

2007
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
There is actually a very big difference

2008
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The main reason is because

2009
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
The teacher is actually

2010
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
On the other side

2011
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
The side you see

2012
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
The person who does the operation

2013
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
You have to talk to the teacher

2014
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You have to say

2015
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
What are the attitudes of these reviewers

2016
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What are their focus

2017
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Once you have

2018
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
After this information

2019
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You are preparing your materials

2020
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Will be more efficient

2021
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
You don't have to think about it

2022
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
The materials you prepared

2023
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Will be more

2024
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Really able to address

2025
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
What these reviewers want to see

2026
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
OK

2027
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
If you say this

2028
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If you start doing it in the second or third year

2029
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
OK

2030
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
If you say you are off duty

2031
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
After a year

2032
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
If you want to go abroad

2033
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I think you have to do it now

2034
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Another

2035
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
The method is

2036
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
If you have a partner

2037
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
If you have a co-director

2038
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
There are basically only two recommendations

2039
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Let the teachers

2040
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Have a good impression of you

2041
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Get things done

2042
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Give the teacher enough time

2043
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think

2044
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The teacher's letter is usually good

2045
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
OK

2046
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I hope this answers

2047
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
The question of the student

2048
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
There is a second question

2049
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I think it should be

2050
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
For the recommended choice

2051
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Will choose

2052
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
The same field but not the most familiar

2053
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Or two different fields

2054
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But a teacher who is familiar with himself

2055
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Professor Yang answered that he was more inclined to be two

2056
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Can you give me a reason

2057
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
What do you think

2058
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Because like we said

2059
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Now apply for a doctorate

2060
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Your field

2061
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's impossible for you to be in the same field as now

2062
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You usually have to read the doctorate

2063
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You will read more professionally

2064
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You have to do some changes in the teacher's field

2065
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's more important

2066
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You are in college or doing something

2067
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
What kind of experience do you have

2068
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Your performance

2069
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Whether it's your class performance

2070
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Or your performance with the teacher

2071
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Of course, find a teacher who is familiar with you

2072
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
To be able to recommend you more deeply

2073
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Where is your strength

2074
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Where is your performance

2075
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You find the same field

2076
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It's like what Mr. Chen just said

2077
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's better not to write

2078
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I don't know how to recommend

2079
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
You have to be in the same field

2080
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
But you are not familiar with me

2081
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
What am I going to write

2082
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It's not good for you

2083
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It's better to find

2084
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
What we mean by familiar

2085
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's not that you have a good relationship with the teacher

2086
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's not useful

2087
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I often go to the bathroom with the teacher

2088
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's not like that

2089
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
The teacher may be able to evaluate your personality

2090
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But not only personality

2091
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Familiar is that you take the teacher's class

2092
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I think it's very impressive

2093
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
For example, you often take the initiative to ask the teacher

2094
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
For example, after class, go to the teacher to discuss

2095
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Or the teacher has a very good impression of your research plan

2096
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Or something

2097
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It's like this

2098
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know if this answer

2099
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Mr. Chen, do you want to add

2100
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I think Mr. Yang said very well

2101
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I think it's the field

2102
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Everyone will find it when they get older

2103
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Not so important

2104
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I use my own example

2105
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
My university is doing 5G material synthesis

2106
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I went abroad to study

2107
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
When I went abroad to study

2108
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Physics and chemistry

2109
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
When I was a doctor

2110
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's biophysics

2111
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And now it's neuroscience

2112
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Biophysics

2113
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I've been turning my field

2114
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
So I think the field is actually in

2115
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
When you do high-level education

2116
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's not that important

2117
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Because in the end everyone is together

2118
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You need knowledge in all aspects

2119
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
To do integration

2120
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
The teacher must really know you

2121
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
When the teacher is writing a recommendation

2122
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Don't let everyone think

2123
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
The teacher's recommendation is

2124
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm familiar with you, I'll write you well

2125
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Not like this

2126
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
A strong recommendation must be a

2127
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Fact-based recommendation

2128
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
OK

2129
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
The teacher will do what you do

2130
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Then comment on that thing

2131
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
From his point of view

2132
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
OK, the student did this thing

2133
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
From my point of view

2134
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
What are the advantages

2135
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
What is it that I think

2136
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's very suitable for a PhD student

2137
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
OK, so if you're just

2138
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm familiar with the teacher

2139
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
OK, but you don't have any specific evidence

2140
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Please write the teacher

2141
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's also difficult for the teacher to write

2142
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
A strong and powerful recommendation

2143
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So don't forget your root

2144
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
You are actually

2145
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
The performance is very strong

2146
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
The teacher knows you

2147
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
The teacher can follow you

2148
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Do further comment

2149
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
This will be a strong recommendation

2150
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
OK, you have to let the teacher know

2151
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You know so much

2152
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
What did you do

2153
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Then let the teacher extend from this thing

2154
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
His unique idea of ​​you

2155
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
These all take time

2156
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
OK, I hope this answers

2157
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The student's question

2158
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I believe

2159
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
For the recommendation

2160
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Is to give more detailed information

2161
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
The next question is from

2162
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I want to ask

2163
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm sorry

2164
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I just found out

2165
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
On the way to the speech

2166
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Someone asked two questions

2167
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So I want to say because that student

2168
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Asked me early

2169
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Ask the student first

2170
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
OK, no problem

2171
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Thank you

2172
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The first question of this student is

2173
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I want to ask the teacher GPA

2174
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Every semester in college

2175
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
About 3.8 to 4

2176
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Do you still need to spend the score sheet to write

2177
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Or can you not mention it at all in the architecture

2178
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
See the score sheet or CV is enough

2179
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I can mention

2180
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
If you are 3.8 to 4

2181
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Then you must have won a lot of awards

2182
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Right

2183
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Then you have to write what you have won

2184
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Or like this

2185
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Then my other one is

2186
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
If you only have a good GPA

2187
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Then there is nothing else to mention in life

2188
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Then only mention GPA

2189
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Am I talking too much

2190
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
But of course I hope

2191
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
In addition to GPA

2192
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
There are more in-depth questions

2193
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Why do I want to do this research

2194
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Why do I want to do this research

2195
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
That thing your motivation

2196
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's definitely not because I have a GPA of 3.8

2197
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It's definitely not like this

2198
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So I think SOP is for you

2199
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Do some more in-depth

2200
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Introduction

2201
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Your own process

2202
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
How your research experience

2203
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
How did you get to this step

2204
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You can also say because of me

2205
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Very enthusiastic

2206
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So my grades are very good

2207
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Of course you won't take the initiative

2208
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
My grades are all 3.8 4.0

2209
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Everyone will say so

2210
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So that's not the point

2211
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Then because you introduce you

2212
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You can write it clearly on your CV

2213
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You will also write it clearly on your CV

2214
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
But you will mention that there must be a purpose

2215
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I want to say because of me

2216
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I am very enthusiastic about these lessons

2217
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Although I work in full time

2218
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I still maintain my grades very well

2219
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Bring this thing into a situation like this

2220
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Instead of the main thing

2221
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
My grades are very good

2222
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Otherwise, life is a bit sad

2223
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I finished writing your SOP in one paragraph

2224
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I think I want to add

2225
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
If GPA

2226
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
If GPA

2227
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Then

2228
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You should be able to

2229
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Use GPA as an example

2230
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Use GPA as an example

2231
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
To say that GPA is so good

2232
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
No one is

2233
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Just for the sake of GPA

2234
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
The reason why your GPA is good

2235
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
There must be a reason in your heart

2236
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Why should I make my GPA so good

2237
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
The most direct way to think about it

2238
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You are really enthusiastic about this science

2239
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You can use your GPA as a proof

2240
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
You can say

2241
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
What am I particularly interested in

2242
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So I spent a lot of time

2243
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So I spent a lot of time

2244
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
On this special project

2245
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Inventor's Outcome

2246
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
My GPA is very good

2247
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
This is also OK

2248
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
When you are drafting these things

2249
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
GPA can be used as a fact

2250
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
GPA can be used as a fact

2251
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You have to explain

2252
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Why in this

2253
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
How to connect this fact

2254
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I want to apply for a Ph.D.

2255
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I want to apply for a Ph.D.

2256
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.

2257
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.

2258
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
OK

2259
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Word is a very

2260
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Strong and meaningful fact

2261
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
If a person

2262
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Has been winning the Nobel Prize for so many years

2263
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
He immediately

2264
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Brought out the message

2265
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
This student is very

2266
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Knowledgeable

2267
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And very

2268
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Persistent

2269
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
If there are these records

2270
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Reviewers will also explain

2271
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Why can this student

2272
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Continue to perform so well for so long

2273
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Right?

2274
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
What are his characteristics?

2275
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It looks very clear

2276
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
The results of this thing

2277
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
For students with good grades

2278
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
That section

2279
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Not so critical

2280
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It is important

2281
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But it won't be a

2282
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Breaking point

2283
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But when your GPA is not so outstanding

2284
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But when your GPA is not so outstanding

2285
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You still hope to be accepted

2286
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The story behind

2287
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You have to make it clear

2288
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I hope I can answer

2289
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
The question of that student

2290
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Wei Zhe

2291
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
He has another question

2292
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The other question of the same student

2293
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The other question of the same student

2294
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
He is currently with his former intern

2295
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
He is currently with his former intern

2296
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Want to let the other person know more

2297
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
His question is

2298
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
His question is

2299
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
When talking to the former intern

2300
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
What do you think about forms?

2301
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
What do you think about forms?

2302
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You have not prepared the terms of the forms

2303
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You have not prepared the terms of the forms

2304
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Still want to ask this famous student

2305
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
This famous student

2306
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Maybe 1 month later

2307
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Maybe 1 month later

2308
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Start again

2309
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Start again

2310
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Do you talk about school application?

2311
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Do you talk about school application?

2312
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Do you talk about school application?

2313
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
16 months

2314
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Suddenly contacted

2315
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
suddenly contacted

2316
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Go to chat with the teacher later

2317
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Go to chat with the teacher later

2318
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Go to chat with the teacher later

2319
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Should not chat

2320
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Should not chat with the teacher later

2321
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Should not chat with the teacher later

2322
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,820
If the teacher's response is also good, then tell the teacher directly

2323
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,820
Of course you can tell the teacher

2324
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,820
Something is still being prepared

2325
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,820
What is the result

2326
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,820
I have to give it to the teacher first

2327
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,820
The remaining thing I prepared and sent it to the teacher

2328
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,820
It's very clear to tell the teacher

2329
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,820
I want to add

2330
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,820
My experience

2331
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,820
Like talking to me

2332
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,820
want

2333
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,820
Recommended students

2334
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,820
I agree with the recommended students

2335
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,640
At the beginning

2336
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,640
Will ask the teacher

2337
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,640
What is the opinion of the class

2338
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,640
OK

2339
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,640
I think this is a good point

2340
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,640
Just

2341
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,640
Demonstrate

2342
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,640
You are interested in applying for the class

2343
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,640
But you are not so sure

2344
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,640
If you ask the teacher about this

2345
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,640
You will let the teacher know

2346
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,640
This student is likely to apply for the class

2347
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,640
Then I can put

2348
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,460
You don't have to prepare anything at this stage

2349
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,460
Right

2350
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,460
But when you do this

2351
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,460
Tell the teacher

2352
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,460
I think I will

2353
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,460
Interested in research

2354
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,460
But my knowledge of the doctoral class is very limited

2355
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,460
Can you share with me

2356
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,460
Do you know the doctoral class

2357
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,460
I believe it will be for me

2358
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,460
Decide my future life

2359
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,460
Has a great help

2360
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,460
In this case

2361
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,460
You don't have to worry about whether you have prepared your file

2362
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,280
You can start from the teacher

2363
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,280
Let you know

2364
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,280
What do you think about the other side

2365
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,280
The teacher will know

2366
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,280
This student is likely to apply for the doctoral class

2367
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,280
After several talks

2368
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,280
Actually

2369
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,280
When you ask the teacher for a recommendation letter

2370
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,280
The teacher already has enough knowledge

2371
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,280
When you really want to apply

2372
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,280
Give the teacher enough time to write

2373
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,280
Then put your

2374
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Grades

2375
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,280
CV and SOP to the teacher

2376
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,100
OK

2377
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,100
OK

2378
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,100
Is this OK

2379
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,100
Should be OK

2380
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,100
If we follow the chat

2381
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,100
Answer directly

2382
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,100
For example, Carrie asked

2383
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,100
Can you ask the teacher directly

2384
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,100
Of course

2385
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,100
Because sometimes you tell the teacher

2386
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,100
I want to apply for the doctoral class

2387
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,100
When the teacher is interested in the teacher's work

2388
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,920
Usually the teacher will tell you directly

2389
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,920
The teacher won't say he's not here

2390
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
And he won't tell you in the past few years

2391
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,920
The teacher won't do this

2392
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,920
If you know that the teacher is interested in your work

2393
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,920
The teacher will tell you directly

2394
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,920
Of course you can ask

2395
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,920
In fact, the teacher will answer directly

2396
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,920
Teacher Chen asked a lot of questions

2397
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,920
I will read it

2398
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,920
Some may be answered by Teacher Chen

2399
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,920
OK

2400
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,920
Let you answer this part

2401
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,920
He said

2402
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,740
Is leadership important for all fields?

2403
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,740
Or is it more emphasis on some fields?

2404
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,740
Leadership

2405
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,740
I think there is a bonus

2406
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,740
If not, it won't matter

2407
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,740
Some schools will become very important

2408
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,740
I see

2409
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,740
I think the most important thing now

2410
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,740
If you want to go to medical school

2411
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,740
Medical school

2412
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:18,740
Leadership

2413
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,740
Everyone has to have

2414
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,740
If you apply for a foreign school in Taiwan

2415
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,740
I think if it's a general R1 school

2416
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,560
Not so much

2417
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,560
But if you have

2418
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,560
It will be a bonus

2419
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,560
I will add one more thing

2420
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,560
I think leadership is more important

2421
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,560
When you apply for a teaching job

2422
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,560
When applying for a teaching job

2423
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,560
Leadership will be more important than graduate students

2424
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,560
More important

2425
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,560
Yes

2426
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,560
I agree

2427
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,560
Then

2428
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,560
He said that if he had known

2429
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,560
Can you mention the graduation age first?

2430
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,380
How many years can you consider taking the exam?

2431
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,380
How many years to intern outside?

2432
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,380
I can only say that dreams are sweet

2433
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,380
Reality is bitter

2434
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,380
Does Teacher Chen want to add anything?

2435
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,380
Of course you can mention

2436
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,380
But do you want to ask the teacher to write the contract?

2437
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,380
The teacher has to sign

2438
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:12,380
How many years do I have to take the exam?

2439
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:14,380
And how many years can I intern?

2440
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,380
I think of course you can mention

2441
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,380
But sometimes the teacher has to work with you

2442
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,380
To know your situation

2443
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,380
Or look at your questions

2444
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Then you may have to

2445
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Or I have a good class

2446
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,200
The teacher told me

2447
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
Don't take classes anymore

2448
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
You have more credits than college students

2449
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Okay, I should be ready to graduate

2450
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Everyone has a different

2451
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,200
But this thing

2452
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
At least in our society

2453
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
I don't know if natural science can sign a contract

2454
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,200
I guess there is no way

2455
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,200
I think this question

2456
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,200
The topic we talked about today

2457
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,200
It's a bit irrelevant

2458
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,020
Now we focus more on how to apply

2459
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,020
This is more like you have already got the admission

2460
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,020
You have to find a teacher

2461
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,020
Can you ask these questions?

2462
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,020
For this question

2463
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,020
I think

2464
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,020
If you want to find the real answer

2465
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,020
In fact, it is not to ask the instructor

2466
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:10,020
But to ask the student of the instructor

2467
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,020
You are quite reasonable

2468
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
Will be closer to

2469
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:16,020
Your actual expectations

2470
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,020
Because

2471
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:20,020
To be honest

2472
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,840
Usually

2473
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,840
You won't get any useful information

2474
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,840
If you get the answer

2475
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,840
You will say it depends

2476
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,840
Because too many things will decide

2477
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,840
The timeline of graduation

2478
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,840
If the teacher says you have to submit three papers

2479
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,840
To graduate

2480
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,840
If you find the experiment is stuck

2481
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,840
What should you do?

2482
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,840
You don't want the teacher to use

2483
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,840
Specific papers to limit your graduation time

2484
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,840
Right?

2485
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,840
So I think this is very professor-dependent

2486
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:51,660
So when you are a non-admission

2487
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,660
There are still a lot of questions

2488
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,660
How do you choose a teacher?

2489
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,660
What should you focus on?

2490
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,660
Of course, we didn't talk about it today

2491
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,660
I think

2492
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,660
If you think

2493
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,660
This is really a problem

2494
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,660
I think you can participate

2495
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,660
Maybe Tara has some other

2496
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,660
Webinars

2497
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,660
Talk about

2498
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,660
How to choose

2499
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,660
Advisor

2500
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,480
How to have a successful PhD

2501
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,480
I think that's a good topic

2502
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,480
If you just want

2503
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,480
First-layer information

2504
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,480
I think

2505
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
You don't need to ask the teacher

2506
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Because you won't get any useful answer

2507
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,480
Maybe it's better to ask the students

2508
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,480
If it's the same

2509
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,480
We skip the advisor part

2510
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
Because it's also

2511
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,480
How to have a successful experience

2512
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
Guanjing

2513
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,480
She said

2514
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Not good enough

2515
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But you have the paper experience

2516
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
That's good

2517
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
But you have the research experience

2518
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
That's also good

2519
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And then outstanding

2520
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
That's beneficial

2521
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And outstanding

2522
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I think

2523
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Well, I don't think

2524
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Everyone is outstanding

2525
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
If everyone is outstanding

2526
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Then no one is outstanding

2527
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So I think

2528
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
What I should do is

2529
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
How to present my best side

2530
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
To the reviewer in the best way

2531
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I think that's enough

2532
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
The word outstanding is too heavy

2533
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yeah

2534
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
You say

2535
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
You say we receive the best students

2536
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Is it outstanding?

2537
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I said most of the time it's not outstanding

2538
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Right?

2539
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But are we looking for outstanding students?

2540
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
No, we don't actually need outstanding students

2541
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
OK

2542
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
We just need a coachable

2543
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
OK

2544
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Then we can

2545
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
We think he can grow and become a Ph.D.

2546
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Under our education system

2547
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Then my definition of Ph.D.

2548
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Of course

2549
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
When this student encounters a problem

2550
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
He can come up with solutions

2551
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
He can find available resources

2552
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
OK

2553
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Come up with proper hypothesis

2554
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Design a proper experiment

2555
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
OK

2556
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Then we can figure out what's going on

2557
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
That's my definition of Ph.D.

2558
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Right?

2559
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Do we need to be outstanding?

2560
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
No, we don't

2561
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
As long as we are coachable

2562
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And know how to do things

2563
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Right?

2564
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And have basic scientific sense

2565
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
That's enough

2566
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So don't put so much pressure on yourself

2567
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
To make yourself outstanding

2568
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
If you want to make yourself outstanding

2569
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I'm sorry

2570
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
We are done with the discussion

2571
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Recommendation to find a non-Ph.D.

2572
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I think it's OK

2573
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Chinese Academy of Sciences is also a research position

2574
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
If you have any real research experience

2575
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And some cooperation

2576
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
That's definitely fine

2577
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I believe we both agree

2578
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
The point is

2579
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Whether you can really evaluate your ability

2580
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Your potential

2581
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Or your research experience

2582
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I think it's this

2583
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I think this is what we were talking about

2584
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
In the presentation

2585
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Do you have any other potential you would like to see

2586
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Other than your academic achievement

2587
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I think this is area-dependent

2588
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I guess

2589
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
In the field of natural science

2590
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Do you have any lab experience

2591
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What skills do you have

2592
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That's important

2593
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
In the field of social humanities

2594
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Maybe

2595
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Your social participation

2596
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Your social care

2597
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Or something like this

2598
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Maybe it's important to us

2599
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
That's a motivation

2600
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Especially if I study criminal studies

2601
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Some of our students

2602
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
They are very concerned about social justice

2603
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
They have some

2604
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
What kind of group or what kind of leadership

2605
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
What kind of library

2606
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Those things become important

2607
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So what I think is

2608
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Maybe you can look at different areas

2609
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I think this thing is actually quite area-dependent

2610
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So I don't think we can deal with it

2611
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
External funding

2612
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
You said public funding

2613
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
There's Director Huang up there

2614
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'd like to thank you

2615
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Director Huang

2616
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
But the question he asked

2617
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
If he had his own

2618
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Department of Education

2619
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
My last name is Lan

2620
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But Professor Yang

2621
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I think his question is

2622
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
If he had his own

2623
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Department of Education

2624
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Department of Education

2625
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I think he's asking

2626
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
If he brought his own funding

2627
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Does it increase

2628
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
For example, the chance of being accepted by the school

2629
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
There are two points

2630
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That is

2631
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
The basic answer is yes

2632
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Because that means

2633
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
It's your external recognition

2634
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Like we just mentioned

2635
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
This is your recognition of you

2636
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
You've been evaluated

2637
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
You can say I'm the only winner

2638
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
That means you have potential in this place

2639
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
But the other part

2640
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I saw an experience last year

2641
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
A student in Taiwan

2642
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
He applied for a B.S.

2643
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And then he applied

2644
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Of course, many students want it

2645
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But when the economy is more

2646
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I know

2647
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Some schools say

2648
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Since you have money, we won't give you money

2649
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So the students feel very depressed

2650
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Why should I lie to the school

2651
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I didn't bring any money

2652
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
The school will give me the money

2653
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Because the student is quite good

2654
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
My answer is

2655
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I don't think it's necessary

2656
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Because he still found

2657
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
He brought the money

2658
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
He is still willing to give him the money

2659
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's just that it may not be his first or second choice

2660
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
My idea is

2661
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Of course, when the school's budget is tight

2662
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There will be such considerations

2663
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
How to divide some of the money

2664
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
To the most students

2665
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
He would like to say that you have money

2666
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
To what extent

2667
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And what kind of help

2668
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The student told me

2669
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
If I don't bring the school's budget

2670
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I still have the school's budget

2671
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
The school's budget may only be given to you for three years

2672
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
You may have to measure this yourself

2673
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Basically, yes, you are

2674
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I think so

2675
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Age will not

2676
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Age will never be deducted

2677
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
If the United States asks the age

2678
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Age will not be the deduction point

2679
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I believe me and Mr. Chen

2680
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
We are basically like this

2681
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Age will not be deducted

2682
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
If you have work experience

2683
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
In fact, it is usually a bonus

2684
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I want to add

2685
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Basically, I agree with Mr. Yang

2686
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
But if you are

2687
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Maybe 40 or 50

2688
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
If you come out to read PhD

2689
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
The reviewer may have some concerns

2690
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
We actually had a lot before

2691
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I've been working in the industry for a long time

2692
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Because everyone knows

2693
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But it turns out that what you bring is different

2694
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Like they are actually in the government

2695
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
After working for more than ten years

2696
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
He will bring in a lot of food experience

2697
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
So that means

2698
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Usually I guess the research institute

2699
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
No school will be all

2700
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
These students came in

2701
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
But there will be some students like this

2702
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Is to increase its diversity

2703
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
But you will never

2704
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
But definitely not because of age

2705
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
He won't see how old you are

2706
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Basically this will not happen

2707
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
When everyone is reviewing your information

2708
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Will feel that this person is very interesting

2709
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So they will do more discussion

2710
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I think it will

2711
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
At least in

2712
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I think there may be this kind of situation in science and engineering

2713
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Because everyone expects students

2714
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Everyone hopes

2715
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Promote young students

2716
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Education

2717
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
In this case, let's say you are very old

2718
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I don't know how old I am

2719
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Maybe 60 or 70 years old

2720
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Some are too old

2721
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It's very difficult to move a steel bottle

2722
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
There may be some problems in actual operation

2723
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
They may

2724
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
There will be a more in-depth discussion about this case

2725
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I should say this

2726
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But basically

2727
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
The age should not be a problem

2728
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
The student asked

2729
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Your statement of purpose

2730
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Do you want to write it very carefully

2731
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Like a proposal or a summary

2732
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I think this thing

2733
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Is

2734
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Proposal

2735
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Because he has some

2736
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
If you look at the teacher for too long

2737
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
There will be no way to endure

2738
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
To be honest

2739
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
But if you write too rough

2740
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I'm just interested in this

2741
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
There is no evidence to prove

2742
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I think it's too weak

2743
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So I think

2744
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
What are you interested in

2745
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
If you can support

2746
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Why are you interested in this

2747
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Instead of just saying that I am interested in this

2748
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I think this is a stronger case

2749
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Of course, I don't know how to write it like a proposal

2750
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Unless the school specifically requires you to write a proposal

2751
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I think it's in the middle

2752
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I think this is a good practice

2753
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Let everyone be able to use two or three

2754
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Two or three sentences

2755
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Summarize what you have learned

2756
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I think it takes time to practice

2757
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Like Mr. Yang said

2758
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I don't think you can write it too fine

2759
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
You can't write it too broad

2760
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It must be right

2761
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
We were reminded

2762
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
That we are already entering the breakout section

2763
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And we are over time

2764
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It turned out to be 9.30

2765
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
We are already over time

2766
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Let's go to the breakout room first

2767
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I'm sorry to bother you

2768
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Please help us get to the breakout room

2769
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
OK

2770
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I would like to remind you

2771
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Let me remind everyone

2772
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
We are now divided into two breakout room

2773
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
If you have any questions

2774
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
For professors in different fields

2775
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
You are welcome to

2776
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Ask questions in the corresponding field

2777
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
If there is a question

2778
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
In the general Q&A session

2779
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
If it is not answered

2780
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You are also welcome to

2781
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Ask the professor

2782
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
In the general breakout room

2783
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Ideally, you should be able to

2784
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Choose the breakout room

2785
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
We will leave one or two people

2786
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
In the main session

2787
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
To answer some technical questions

2788
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
If you have any technical questions

2789
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You are welcome to let me know

2790
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Thank you Wei Zhe

2791
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Thanks Wei Zhe

2792
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Wei Zhe and Terry were talking about writing sample.

2793
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
How important is writing sample?

2794
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Sociology students want to know how good your English writing ability is.

2795
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Sociology students focus on your English ability.

2796
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You need to be able to communicate, even write.

2797
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It's similar to SOP.

2798
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
You need to be able to convince people that you have an important goal.

2799
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Writing sample wants to know how good your academic ability is,

2800
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
and how good your English ability is.

2801
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
The recommended direction is what you have written before.

2802
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Of course, writing an essay or diary will be a little awkward.

2803
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Of course, it is more focused on academic papers.

2804
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Unless you are applying to the Department of Humanities and Sciences,

2805
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
for example, you are applying for a master's degree in literature.

2806
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Of course, it is more related to the field of writing.

2807
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Let me explain.

2808
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Professor Yang is assigned to the first breakout session.

2809
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Professor Chen is assigned to the second breakout session.

2810
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Everyone else is assigned to the second breakout session.

2811
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You can choose to accept or not accept.

2812
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.

2813
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.

2814
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Thank you, Professor Chen.

2815
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Thank you, both professors.

2816
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
There is no follow-up after the breakout session today.

2817
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
You can leave the meeting now.

2818
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Please remember that a postgraduate lecture is scheduled on August 28th.

2819
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Please remember that a postgraduate lecture is scheduled on August 28th.

2820
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
CVSOP will have a free review soon.

2821
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Please refer to Sandbox's event.

2822
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Thank you.

2823
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Thank you.

2824
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Thank you.

2825
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Thank you.

2826
01:41:49,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Thank you.
