0	5000	Let me start by introducing Annie.
5000	11000	Annie completed her Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Sydney, Australia last year.
11000	16000	She is currently a Senior Research Officer at the University of Technology Sydney,
16000	22000	working closely with the Associate Dean of Indigenous Land and Justice Research Hub.
22000	28000	Before completing her Ph.D., Annie was awarded a Master by Research and a Master of Cultural Studies
28000	33000	with Gender and Cultural Studies, also at the University of Sydney.
33000	39000	Her research interests include human geography, labor and spouse immigration, urban planning,
39000	45000	circular migration in the South Pacific, resource and livelihood,
45000	53000	Southern Asian studies, rural economics, Australian aid, the end of the user experiences,
53000	57000	remittances, and substantial development.
57000	62000	Annie is fluent in English, Mandarin, Tartoon, and Taiwanese.
62000	64000	Let's start with Annie.
64000	65000	Thank you.
65000	67000	Thank you, everyone.
67000	73000	I'd like to go over my topic for today.
73000	80000	My topic is Life After Migration, Migration, Urbanization, and Mobility in Geography.
80000	89000	Geography is the capital of a country called Timor-Leste.
89000	94000	You can see a cute little house on my PowerPoint.
94000	103000	According to Taiwanese, it's a traditional sacred house.
103000	109000	When I was still doing my Ph.D.
109000	112000	I lived in the Far East for about seven months.
112000	120000	I worked there from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019.
120000	126000	As the host mentioned, I speak Tartoon.
126000	133000	Many of my interviews were done in English plus Tartoon.
133000	141000	After I returned to Australia, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sydney.
141000	149000	I went to UTS, the University of Sydney Technology, as a Senior Research Officer.
149000	155000	In the U.S., I would be considered an Assistant Researcher or Assistant Professor.
155000	159000	But in Australia, we have a clear distinction.
159000	161000	So I only do research.
161000	164000	I didn't teach this semester.
164000	167000	So I don't call myself a professor.
167000	175000	In Australia, we have professors, assistant professors, and professors.
175000	179000	We don't have an assistant professor.
179000	184000	So we have lecturers, senior lecturers, and associate professors.
185000	190000	As you can see from my PowerPoint,
190000	197000	I'm going to talk about East Taiwan and Australia.
197000	202000	I know that most of our listeners are in Taiwan or the U.S.
202000	208000	So you may not know much about the South Pacific.
208000	213000	I think this is what makes lecturing valuable.
213000	217000	It shows us that there are different possibilities in life.
217000	220000	Of course, it's still a research topic.
220000	223000	So I'm still going to talk about what I'm studying.
223000	227000	What is my method?
227000	231000	From a geographical perspective,
231000	235000	what's the point of living there for seven months?
235000	237000	What else did I discover?
237000	241000	So the first point I'm talking about is resource management.
241000	245000	So why is it useful to do research in this small country?
245000	248000	Is it useful for Australia or Taiwan?
248000	251000	Or is it useful for them?
251000	258000	My Ph.D. was covered by an Australian aid program.
258000	260000	Australian aid is the same as U.S. aid.
260000	268000	Australian aid was used to assist the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia.
268000	272000	Taiwan used to receive aid.
272000	274000	We used to have U.S. aid.
274000	277000	So it's a miracle for Taiwan's economy.
277000	282000	But we can think about whether we can replicate this in other countries.
282000	287000	Or what direction can Taiwan's aid be in the future on the South Pacific?
287000	291000	So I'm going to talk about its resources.
291000	294000	My PowerPoint has oil.
294000	297000	And it's very young.
297000	300000	And you can't find a job in the local area.
300000	302000	That's the point of today.
302000	305000	Remittances is right.
305000	309000	As long as it's a private loan, it's called remittances.
309000	311000	It's different from A.
311000	315000	A is government-to-government agreement.
315000	320000	But remittances can be sent from Australia to Boxuan for $100.
320000	322000	This is remittances.
323000	330000	So a lot of people would like to send people abroad to work or study.
330000	335000	And there are a lot of natural resources in the local area.
335000	341000	So there's coconut, palm oil, and coffee.
341000	347000	So my first point is that there are a lot of Australian aid projects.
347000	352000	One of them is the Australian Seasonal Workers Program that I did.
352000	357000	It's very similar to the plan for Taiwanese to go to Australia for holiday work.
357000	364000	But the biggest difference is that Taiwanese or Australians are free to go to Australia for holiday work.
364000	366000	Because they're holiday workers.
366000	369000	But this is a South Pacific island.
369000	373000	Only workers from countries supported by Australia can come.
373000	375000	They're government-to-government agreements.
375000	378000	So it's a bit like our diplomatic model plan.
378000	383000	So workers are actually treated very well in Australia.
383000	385000	Because this is the face of the country.
385000	387000	And it's government-to-government agreements.
387000	390000	So if Taiwanese go to Australia for holiday work,
390000	396000	you have to find a job, find a house, apply for a visa, and do everything yourself.
396000	403000	But if it's a Pacific islander, like Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and my Timorese workers,
403000	406000	they're already set up.
406000	409000	Everything's set up for you.
409000	411000	All you have to do is fly over.
411000	414000	So that's a very different thing.
414000	420000	And they often have ambassadors from Pacific islands to see the workers.
420000	422000	Make sure they are treated very well.
422000	424000	This is a big difference.
424000	428000	So a lot of people, because of the support of this plan,
428000	433000	they can buy land or build a house when they return to their home country.
433000	438000	Or a lot of islanders like to party.
438000	443000	So a lot of it is spent on the maintenance of social networks.
443000	447000	The third and final point I want to talk about is
447000	451000	what I find challenging.
451000	455000	As a woman, and as you can see, I'm not white.
455000	457000	But I'm from Australia.
458000	461000	I'm Australian, I'm Taiwanese, I'm Hakka.
461000	470000	So this is how I negotiated my positionality.
470000	473000	Of course, sometimes it's boring when you first go.
473000	476000	And basically, as long as they see you as a woman,
476000	480000	they'll think you're a high-ranking wife or something.
480000	483000	They won't respect me as a professor.
483000	486000	Sexism and xenophobia.
486000	489000	This is what I'm talking about.
489000	492000	In fact, a lot of Pacific islanders have Chinese roots.
492000	496000	But how do Chinese people get along with them locally?
496000	500000	That will actually affect how they see my role.
500000	506000	Or I'll talk about how I often walk on the road and get touched by children.
506000	509000	Or pull my hair or something.
510000	513000	But I can speak local dialect.
513000	516000	So when I use local dialect to scare them, they'll be surprised.
516000	519000	Oh, this foreigner can speak local dialect.
519000	521000	And he seems to be from Australia.
521000	523000	They're scared when they see someone from Australia.
523000	526000	Because the role of Don Lee-Woon is very ambiguous.
526000	529000	He's a bit of an Australian colonial enemy.
529000	535000	So I'll talk a little bit about the history of Don Lee-Woon and Australian roles.
535000	538000	So we need to know where T-Mall is.
538000	540000	Where is Australia?
540000	543000	So you may have no problem with geography in this regard.
543000	545000	Where is Australia?
545000	548000	This is a map of the United States.
548000	553000	So the size of Australia is actually about the same size as that of the United States and Canada.
553000	558000	Don Lee-Woon is on this small island in the north.
558000	559000	It's a very small island.
559000	564000	It's between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
564000	565000	It's actually very small.
565000	567000	It's smaller than Taiwan.
567000	571000	But the complexity of its population is actually similar to that of Taiwan.
571000	576000	Because it has a mountainous terrain.
576000	577000	It's quite similar to Taiwan.
577000	578000	Mountainous.
578000	583000	And there are only two seasons, dry season and rainy season.
583000	586000	I was so happy when I went there in August.
586000	588000	It's about 40 degrees every day.
588000	593000	By November or December, like now, it's rainy season.
593000	598000	You go out every day like this to pick water.
598000	605000	In such a situation, it also has a lot of products.
605000	609000	Because there is a lot of rainwater, you can grow anything you want to live.
609000	612000	So there are a lot of things.
612000	614000	I'll pick a few first.
614000	617000	The first one is why I did this PhD.
617000	620000	Because Australians think it's important.
620000	623000	Because there is oil in the back garden of Australia.
623000	626000	So you can see it on this map.
626000	627000	Australia is here.
627000	630000	And then there's a small island on top of it.
630000	631000	It's Papua New Guinea.
631000	632000	Next to it is Indonesia.
632000	637000	So it's about the 17th century.
637000	640000	The Portuguese came and took over Papua New Guinea.
640000	643000	And then it's been there for over 300 years.
643000	645000	Basically, the number of buildings is not very large.
645000	648000	If I want to be more diplomatic.
649000	658000	The Portuguese brought them nothing but singing, dancing, Latin names and Catholicism.
658000	662000	There's not even a railway.
662000	665000	And they didn't build a university.
665000	670000	So in fact, the Portuguese are the characters over there.
670000	671000	I want your sandals.
671000	673000	I'm the sandalwood.
673000	676000	The locals used to talk about sandalwood, but now they don't.
677000	680000	I don't want to do a lot more construction.
680000	683000	But in the post-Papua New Guinea colonial era.
683000	687000	It was from the 1960s to the 1970s.
687000	689000	Natural gas was discovered in the East.
689000	695000	It's the kind of natural gas that you can light up in your backyard.
695000	697000	Natural gas floats up from the ground like this.
697000	702000	Of course, the Portuguese didn't have the Renaissance Revolution.
702000	705000	So I don't want to be able to pick it up.
705000	711000	But they found a lot of Indonesian businessmen who were actually very interested.
711000	713000	Australia is also very interested.
713000	715000	The United States is also very interested.
715000	720000	In the end, Indonesia's stronghold next to it was occupied by Dongding in 1975.
720000	722000	And then Australia signed a contract with Indonesia and said,
722000	725000	Hey, let's open the Timo Sea Oil below you, okay?
725000	727000	That's their cooperation.
727000	732000	But because Indonesia was independent in 1975 to 2002.
732000	736000	There's construction between 25 years.
736000	740000	There's a university and there's a lot of scholarships.
740000	746000	And then there's actually a little bit of the whole domestic economy of Dongding.
746000	749000	There's a construction infrastructure.
749000	751000	But he killed a lot of people after all.
752000	758000	In the 1992 massacre in Santa Mascara.
758000	766000	The issue of human rights in Dongding caused strong interest in the international community.
766000	768000	Yes, of course, in the end, Indonesia was there.
768000	771000	Ah, there's no way to go on.
771000	774000	And then the United Nations sent troops.
775000	780000	So, in 1999, they had the world's first record.
780000	782000	It's an independent referendum.
782000	790000	And then it was decided that a lot of people who were close to 99% decided to be independent.
790000	792000	We want our own country.
792000	794000	We don't want to be a province in Indonesia.
794000	796000	So they're independent.
796000	800000	So, from 1999 to 2000, the UN sent troops.
801000	804000	Most of the people in the UN are American or Australian.
804000	808000	So Australia and his ambiguous relationship has been going on for a long time.
808000	812000	But now it's officially the UN sent troops.
812000	818000	So what about the oil treaty between Indonesia and Australia?
818000	822000	So they're renegotiating the bond.
822000	830000	And then it becomes the oil of Dongding and all kinds of natural resources start to be exploited.
830000	836000	And maybe there's a bigger chance that they're going to let their own people manage their own resources.
836000	840000	So then they set up a team.
840000	842000	Petroleum fund.
842000	850000	It's about putting the oil revenue into the country's reserve fund.
850000	858000	In Taiwan, it's called redistribution fund.
858000	866000	And then we're going to talk about whether or not the money has been used properly.
866000	868000	And then there's the whole situation of the people's livelihood.
868000	872000	But in addition to oil, they have pretty good coffee.
872000	876000	Yes, I put a picture of Fairtrade's Timor-Leste coffee.
876000	878000	And a lot of coconut.
878000	882000	There's a province in the east called Los Barros.
882000	886000	They produce a lot of good quality coconut.
886000	890000	And I put the Dongding sea water I shot there.
890000	892000	Their sea water is really clear.
892000	894000	I haven't been to Palau.
894000	900000	But I heard from some of my friends who have been to Palau.
900000	906000	He said that the feeling of looking under the Dongding sea water is similar to that of Palau.
906000	908000	It's very beautiful and pollution-free.
908000	912000	So it's actually very rich in marine resources.
912000	916000	And then there's the most important resource.
916000	920000	I think it's also about determining whether or not this country can develop the most important resource, which is people.
920000	924000	Let's take a look at the demography of Timor-Leste.
924000	926000	Look at the population.
926000	928000	It looks very young.
928000	934000	Most people are under the age of 25.
934000	940000	When I was in the Dongding sea water, I was over 30 years old.
940000	944000	But young people over the age of 10 are at a loss.
944000	948000	But if someone looks very old, like over 50 years old.
948000	952000	It will be respected by the local community.
952000	956000	Because we can see that there is a gap between the population pyramid 35 to 39.
956000	960000	Then we can push it back a little bit.
960000	962000	They had a war more than 20 years ago.
962000	968000	At that time, it was those 18-year-old men who were going to serve in the military.
968000	972000	Usually quite a lot of people died on the battlefield.
972000	974000	So now they are about 40 years old.
974000	976000	Then there is the population pyramid.
976000	980000	It is in the age bracket of 35 to 45 years old.
980000	982000	There will be a shortage.
982000	986000	So because there was a civil war before.
986000	990000	So a lot of people just can't do it.
990000	998000	In this situation, develop their own personal economy.
998000	1002000	Or the development of life.
1002000	1006000	Basically caused a lot of problems.
1006000	1014000	Then we are going to talk about the role of Australia in the development of the East China Sea.
1014000	1018000	Because I just said that there are Chinese people in the East China Sea.
1018000	1020000	So basically 75 years ago.
1020000	1024000	Many Chinese people in the East China Sea came to Taiwan to study.
1024000	1028000	Because at that time they were members of the Republic of China.
1028000	1032000	And there is a consulate in Dili.
1032000	1034000	Because they are part of Portugal.
1034000	1036000	At that time, Portugal had diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
1036000	1040000	So from the founding of the Republic of China to 1975.
1040000	1046000	In fact, the relationship between Taiwan and East China Sea has always been very good.
1046000	1052000	A lot of people came to Australia because of the war.
1052000	1054000	Most of them are Chinese.
1054000	1056000	50%.
1056000	1060000	Most Chinese people in East China Sea are very good.
1060000	1062000	And rich.
1062000	1068000	So at that time, they could either choose to go to Taiwan to study.
1068000	1072000	Then a lot of people went to Taiwan to study.
1072000	1074000	Then apply for a refugee visa to Australia.
1074000	1078000	Or some people settled directly in Taiwan.
1078000	1080000	Not necessarily.
1080000	1082000	So now there is a census in Australia.
1082000	1084000	I mean they are Australian.
1084000	1086000	They are Australian citizens.
1086000	1092000	Or permanent residents.
1092000	1094000	Just like there are green cards in the United States.
1094000	1096000	There are about 10,000 people.
1096000	1098000	Of course, there are a few workers.
1098000	1100000	Or people who study abroad.
1100000	1102000	These may not be included in the census.
1102000	1108000	But Australia has always had a very close relationship with the East China Sea.
1108000	1110000	So when we talk about immigration theory.
1110000	1112000	Excuse me.
1112000	1114000	You just said 10,000 people.
1114000	1118000	Is this a high proportion of the population of East China Sea?
1118000	1122000	Yes, because the population of East China Sea is only 1.3 million.
1122000	1124000	Oh, OK.
1124000	1126000	Almost 1% of the population.
1126000	1128000	Yes, almost 1% of the population are in Australia.
1128000	1130000	So Australia is very important to them.
1130000	1134000	Like me and the East China Sea Embassy in Sydney.
1134000	1138000	It's a very good relationship.
1138000	1140000	The Embassy may come to me for a cup of coffee.
1140000	1142000	So they will say.
1142000	1146000	They usually send people to Australia.
1146000	1148000	Must be looking for the best, the highest level.
1148000	1150000	Just like Taiwan sent to Washington.
1150000	1154000	Is a peak of your diplomatic career.
1154000	1156000	So what we are talking about in immigration theory.
1156000	1158000	Migration has a push and pull factor.
1158000	1160000	Is that push and pull.
1160000	1162000	What is your birthplace?
1162000	1166000	How bad is it to let you send you out?
1166000	1168000	Or the place you moved to.
1168000	1170000	Like the United States or Australia.
1170000	1172000	How good is it to let you stay?
1172000	1174000	So what I'm talking about in this PowerPoint.
1174000	1178000	Is it the push and pull factor of the East China Sea?
1178000	1180000	We can take a look.
1180000	1182000	Because it's not very urbanized.
1182000	1184000	31%
1184000	1186000	And this is last year's data.
1186000	1188000	So 31% means.
1188000	1190000	70% of people actually live in rural areas.
1190000	1192000	So think about it.
1192000	1194000	If you are Taiwanese.
1194000	1196000	What was Taiwan like more than 40 years ago?
1196000	1198000	That feeling.
1198000	1200000	Maybe more than 40 years ago.
1200000	1202000	Taiwan's literacy level may be a little higher.
1202000	1204000	A little bit.
1204000	1206000	I don't have that data.
1206000	1208000	Then they have a very important reason.
1208000	1210000	Is the young unemployed population.
1210000	1214000	Because there are really not too many buildings on the island.
1214000	1216000	So if you go to college.
1216000	1218000	They now have about 7 specializations.
1218000	1220000	Plus college.
1220000	1222000	But after going to college.
1222000	1224000	Do you want to find a job?
1224000	1226000	The unemployment rate is 12.3.
1226000	1228000	The unemployment rate in Australia.
1228000	1230000	The overall unemployment rate.
1230000	1232000	It's very high after COVID.
1232000	1234000	Our very high is only 6%.
1234000	1236000	Then this country.
1236000	1238000	The unemployment rate on the island is 12.3%.
1238000	1240000	Then his population is only.
1240000	1242000	1.3 million.
1242000	1244000	And most of it is a very young population.
1244000	1246000	It's the middle of the year.
1246000	1248000	Because of the war.
1248000	1250000	There is no.
1250000	1252000	Their minimum wage.
1252000	1254000	$150 a month.
1254000	1256000	Is to do labor work.
1256000	1260000	I can only make about $5,000 a month.
1260000	1262000	But their official currency.
1262000	1264000	It's in US dollars again.
1264000	1266000	Because there is no ability to.
1266000	1268000	There is no central bank to issue their own currency.
1268000	1270000	So it's in US dollars.
1270000	1272000	Then a dollar or less.
1272000	1274000	There's that little coin.
1274000	1276000	It's called Saint.
1276000	1278000	It's Portuguese.
1278000	1280000	Saint.
1280000	1282000	They were in 2002.
1282000	1284000	After independence.
1284000	1286000	And then there's something like that.
1286000	1288000	The civil war.
1288000	1290000	It's a little bit of an Indian.
1290000	1292000	With that one.
1292000	1294000	A little bit of a local.
1294000	1296000	And there may be people from Australia.
1296000	1298000	There's a little bit of a conflict.
1298000	1300000	So that's in 2006.
1300000	1302000	Plus they're actually.
1302000	1304000	In 2014.
1304000	1306000	With Australia.
1306000	1308000	Because of the oil.
1308000	1310000	And there's a hearing.
1310000	1312000	That's right.
1312000	1314000	Because I'm not a political expert.
1314000	1316000	So I'm not going to go into detail.
1316000	1318000	But we can find out.
1318000	1320000	It's a big problem.
1320000	1322000	So I'm going to repost.
1322000	1324000	So we.
1324000	1326000	So many resources.
1326000	1328000	How does it help the development of this country?
1328000	1330000	Or is it just a resource curse?
1330000	1332000	There's oil, but.
1332000	1334000	It's like oil revenue.
1334000	1336000	It's not owned by the people.
1336000	1338000	Economic development is not up.
1338000	1340000	So then later.
1340000	1342000	The Australian government did something.
1342000	1344000	Just like I just said today.
1344000	1346000	Australian seasonal workers program.
1346000	1348000	To put this.
1348000	1350000	The diplomatic.
1350000	1352000	It should be said that the diplomatic.
1352000	1354000	Political ambition.
1354000	1356000	With the purpose of economic development.
1356000	1358000	Wrap it up into one.
1358000	1360000	Is that it can make both sides.
1360000	1362000	Can accept the immigration plan.
1362000	1364000	So what about this plan?
1364000	1366000	I have a net.
1366000	1368000	And this one on top is mine.
1368000	1370000	He's in one.
1370000	1372000	He's in one.
1372000	1374000	He's probably.
1374000	1376000	Because because the islanders.
1376000	1378000	They don't have that many people.
1378000	1380000	Can go to college.
1380000	1382000	So as long as this plan has.
1382000	1384000	You can join when you're in high school.
1384000	1386000	That might be 18 to 45 years old.
1386000	1388000	That's going to be very capable.
1388000	1390000	So they're going to have some physical tests.
1390000	1392000	It's like Kang.
1392000	1394000	It's not Kang Sabao.
1394000	1396000	But it's a little bit like jumping.
1396000	1398000	Something like that.
1398000	1400000	Can be that.
1400000	1402000	And then there's the hospital.
1402000	1404000	I just realized.
1404000	1406000	I'm going to Australia.
1406000	1408000	Is to the farm or.
1408000	1410000	Because it's a diplomatic plan.
1410000	1412000	So it's not the same as the resort.
1412000	1414000	They can go to some.
1414000	1416000	Places on the Australian coast.
1416000	1418000	There's a place in the northwest of Australia.
1418000	1420000	You can have that.
1420000	1422000	The industry.
1422000	1424000	So it's like that.
1424000	1426000	Remote hospitality.
1426000	1428000	They can actually do it too.
1428000	1430000	There's a pretty big one.
1430000	1432000	The focus is on me.
1432000	1434000	Talking about it.
1434000	1436000	Australia is the first world.
1436000	1438000	So if it's a job search.
1438000	1440000	Like me.
1440000	1442000	I can only have my name.
1442000	1444000	But if today.
1444000	1446000	Assuming my last name is changed.
1446000	1448000	I might be Chinese.
1448000	1450000	And then your application.
1450000	1452000	I'm not going to put up a picture.
1452000	1454000	Yeah.
1454000	1456000	You can only have your academic experience.
1456000	1458000	In order to avoid that.
1458000	1460000	Right.
1460000	1462000	The discrimination of competitors.
1462000	1464000	But if this plan.
1464000	1466000	It allows you to do overseas recruitment.
1466000	1468000	That's a big deal.
1468000	1470000	It's a big deal.
1470000	1472000	So they can do it.
1472000	1474000	Any kind of test.
1474000	1476000	What kind of people do they want to pick?
1476000	1478000	Go to Australia to work.
1478000	1480000	Those who want to use.
1480000	1482000	Want to join this government.
1482000	1484000	Plan.
1484000	1486000	Approve employer.
1486000	1488000	They have to pay.
1488000	1490000	Those migrant workers' visas.
1490000	1492000	Residence.
1492000	1494000	And air tickets.
1494000	1496000	Although it's still deducted from their salary.
1496000	1498000	We call it deduction.
1498000	1500000	But this is basically.
1500000	1502000	There will be a lot of convenience.
1502000	1504000	You can actually.
1504000	1506000	If I'm the owner.
1506000	1508000	I can pick anyone I want.
1508000	1510000	And those in Australia.
1510000	1512000	The law may be very unauthorized.
1512000	1514000	Like this.
1514000	1516000	You can't have pregnant people.
1516000	1518000	Or.
1518000	1520000	People who used to do business.
1520000	1522000	It's in there.
1522000	1524000	But this is in Australia.
1524000	1526000	Local laws are not allowed.
1526000	1528000	If someone is pregnant or married.
1528000	1530000	If you resign.
1530000	1532000	The government will shut down.
1532000	1534000	But this is basically.
1534000	1536000	You can do a lot of tricks.
1536000	1538000	So.
1538000	1540000	In this situation.
1540000	1542000	This plan.
1542000	1544000	A lot of migrant workers.
1544000	1546000	The islanders.
1546000	1548000	They are all very.
1548000	1550000	I should say it's a local business.
1550000	1552000	So.
1552000	1554000	There is also an implication.
1554000	1556000	The Australian government also hopes.
1556000	1558000	We are the best on the island.
1558000	1560000	They should be able to contribute to the local community.
1560000	1562000	Help this country.
1562000	1564000	Can develop.
1564000	1566000	So I made a picture here.
1566000	1568000	These workers may be.
1568000	1570000	In.
1570000	1572000	Regional Australia in the Australian countryside.
1572000	1574000	What do you do?
1574000	1576000	And then the money.
1576000	1578000	He might just send it back.
1578000	1580000	To his wife and children.
1580000	1582000	They will build a house there.
1582000	1584000	And then raise some pigs.
1584000	1586000	Or buy some farmland.
1586000	1588000	The so-called economic effect.
1588000	1590000	From just a family.
1590000	1592000	Expand to a whole community.
1592000	1594000	With a whole country.
1594000	1596000	This is their original expectation.
1596000	1598000	But we can look at this thing.
1598000	1600000	Is it feasible?
1600000	1602000	Because people.
1602000	1604000	You can't put the money.
1604000	1606000	Give the money to others.
1606000	1608000	It has nothing to do with you.
1608000	1610000	So this project must be big enough.
1610000	1612000	Its impact will be big enough.
1612000	1614000	Because I won't just send money to me.
1614000	1616000	A stranger.
1616000	1618000	I might just give it to my brothers and sisters.
1618000	1620000	To my family.
1620000	1622000	So this thing.
1622000	1624000	We will talk about the so-called academic.
1624000	1626000	We will say it is a.
1626000	1628000	Bottom-up approach.
1628000	1630000	Not that top-down.
1630000	1632000	But also these two.
1632000	1634000	Approach.
1634000	1636000	At the same time there is that power.
1636000	1638000	So the development of this country.
1638000	1640000	It may only rise.
1640000	1642000	But we can see that his current ratio is still.
1642000	1644000	31% still in Petroleum.
1644000	1646000	With oil.
1646000	1648000	Then 26% in natural gas.
1648000	1650000	22% in coffee.
1650000	1652000	Is raw coffee.
1652000	1654000	Then there are some other things.
1654000	1656000	Basically it is very small.
1656000	1658000	Then I said.
1658000	1660000	I was doing research at the beginning.
1660000	1662000	I do household survey.
1662000	1664000	Then a local family.
1664000	1666000	There are probably 11 or 12 people.
1666000	1668000	Imagine 45 years ago in Taiwan.
1668000	1670000	Because they are every.
1670000	1672000	Because women will be born.
1672000	1674000	Seven children in a lifetime.
1674000	1676000	If you see three or four.
1676000	1678000	That may be a senior official.
1678000	1680000	Pressure or something.
1680000	1682000	Maybe three or four are very few.
1682000	1684000	So I was.
1684000	1686000	A total of 52 families interviewed.
1686000	1688000	Then there are about 11 or 12 people in each.
1688000	1690000	If the child does not count.
1690000	1692000	I just do one.
1692000	1694000	Similar to the focus group.
1694000	1696000	The nationality.
1696000	1698000	Then ask them.
1698000	1700000	Asked some questions.
1700000	1702000	May be.
1702000	1704000	Because I mainly want to know.
1704000	1706000	How do they spend money?
1706000	1708000	What did you buy?
1708000	1710000	Something like that.
1710000	1712000	I also chased those workers.
1712000	1714000	From the countryside of Australia.
1714000	1716000	This is me.
1716000	1718000	Field map.
1718000	1720000	In Kunshan in the north.
1720000	1722000	Because Australia is a basketball.
1722000	1724000	So our north is a tropical.
1724000	1726000	I remember that time.
1726000	1728000	I drove for a long time.
1728000	1730000	Maybe half an hour.
1730000	1732000	I did not see anything.
1732000	1734000	Australia is very big.
1734000	1736000	After 25 minutes.
1736000	1738000	I only see nothing.
1738000	1740000	In the middle of nowhere.
1740000	1742000	They may live next door.
1742000	1744000	Accommodation.
1744000	1746000	That's it.
1746000	1748000	That kind of house.
1748000	1750000	Six months back once.
1750000	1752000	Six months back to the east.
1752000	1754000	So I was.
1754000	1756000	I was studying for a PhD.
1756000	1758000	Second year or third year.
1758000	1760000	I just followed them.
1760000	1762000	About six or seven months.
1762000	1764000	Then use WhatsApp and Facebook.
1764000	1766000	Contact them.
1766000	1768000	When they are ready to go home.
1768000	1770000	Very simple.
1770000	1772000	I just followed them home.
1772000	1774000	So I can know.
1774000	1776000	What do they use money for?
1776000	1778000	So the result I got later.
1778000	1780000	Where did they spend the money?
1780000	1782000	I came to a conclusion.
1782000	1784000	Basically.
1784000	1786000	36% of people.
1786000	1788000	Spend the money on.
1788000	1790000	Build a house.
1790000	1792000	This is easy to understand.
1792000	1794000	Because.
1794000	1796000	Their traditional house.
1796000	1798000	It's a straw house.
1798000	1800000	I really think the straw house is great.
1800000	1802000	It's very cool to live there.
1802000	1804000	It's a bit like Taiwan.
1804000	1806000	The traditional house.
1806000	1808000	You are the kind of tropical area.
1808000	1810000	Of course it's a straw house.
1810000	1812000	But if it rains.
1812000	1814000	Make a big water.
1814000	1816000	The straw house is washed away.
1816000	1818000	So they still basically.
1818000	1820000	Want to build that kind of western style.
1820000	1822000	Big house.
1822000	1824000	Then there are tropical colors.
1824000	1826000	Maybe the most is orange.
1826000	1828000	Red and green.
1828000	1830000	Then there will be 27% of people.
1830000	1832000	Want to do business.
1832000	1834000	Then I basically.
1834000	1836000	Three or four days ago at the National University of Australia.
1836000	1838000	There is another online conference.
1838000	1840000	Then there are many.
1840000	1842000	Development practitioners will say.
1842000	1844000	How do they use western ideas.
1844000	1846000	Think about it.
1846000	1848000	These islanders should take the money.
1848000	1850000	Then we should teach them how.
1850000	1852000	Financial literacy.
1852000	1854000	This is very.
1854000	1856000	Western colonialist view.
1856000	1858000	I teach you how to use money.
1858000	1860000	Then I said at that time.
1860000	1862000	Say.
1862000	1864000	No one is going to work for someone else.
1864000	1866000	Once they come back from Australia.
1866000	1868000	That's it.
1868000	1870000	You have been working so hard in Australia.
1870000	1872000	And there are white people.
1872000	1874000	Not necessarily white people.
1874000	1876000	Is the boss.
1876000	1878000	Then why do you come back?
1878000	1880000	Still continue to work for white people.
1880000	1882000	Or what kind of person is Australian?
1882000	1884000	Many people want to come back.
1884000	1886000	I just want to be my own boss.
1886000	1888000	So this is basically.
1888000	1890000	I think it's a great market.
1890000	1892000	They will be.
1892000	1894000	Can take this money.
1894000	1896000	Some people are from Indonesia.
1896000	1898000	There are many small and medium-sized businesses in Southeast Asia.
1898000	1900000	There are some people who are because of war.
1900000	1902000	May be young.
1902000	1904000	Their younger sibling.
1904000	1906000	There is no way to complete education.
1906000	1908000	So many of them.
1908000	1910000	Also invest in education.
1910000	1912000	Will send.
1912000	1914000	Will send their younger brothers and sisters.
1914000	1916000	Go to Indonesia to study.
1916000	1918000	Because actually.
1918000	1920000	As you know.
1920000	1922000	The nearest western country there.
1922000	1924000	It is Australia, New Zealand.
1924000	1926000	But the tuition is really expensive.
1926000	1928000	That is a year.
1928000	1930000	It is also 40,000 to 50,000 US dollars.
1930000	1932000	That.
1932000	1934000	Go to other places.
1934000	1936000	Asian countries like Singapore.
1936000	1938000	The competition is too big.
1938000	1940000	Taiwan did not provide scholarships.
1940000	1942000	The most convenient is Indonesia.
1942000	1944000	So many people have mentioned.
1944000	1946000	They want to go back to college.
1946000	1948000	May be going to Indonesia.
1948000	1950000	We may feel in Taiwan.
1950000	1952000	It is a very advanced country.
1952000	1954000	But after all.
1954000	1956000	That is also the Northeast.
1956000	1958000	So Indonesia for them.
1958000	1960000	In fact, the level of development is also very high.
1960000	1962000	And it is a very good choice.
1962000	1964000	So many people.
1964000	1966000	In addition to these three.
1966000	1968000	Build a house and do business.
1968000	1970000	Also invest in education.
1970000	1972000	Many people also bought it.
1972000	1974000	I bought some pigs in the countryside.
1974000	1976000	Domestic animals.
1976000	1978000	Basically more pigs.
1978000	1980000	Or chicken.
1980000	1982000	Or cash crops.
1982000	1984000	Mango trees.
1984000	1986000	Many people buy banana trees.
1986000	1988000	Mango trees.
1988000	1990000	And coconut.
1990000	1992000	Some are quite a lot.
1992000	1994000	Sorry.
1994000	1996000	Can you go back to the top?
1996000	1998000	I have two questions.
1998000	2000000	The first one is.
2000000	2002000	These are all interviews, right?
2002000	2004000	I saw the data.
2004000	2006000	All interviews.
2006000	2008000	In fact, I also double verify.
2008000	2010000	Because many times.
2010000	2012000	What they want to do with him.
2012000	2014000	Not the same.
2014000	2016000	Because of me.
2016000	2018000	Only through Western Union.
2018000	2020000	It's Australia.
2020000	2022000	I actually have an Australian.
2022000	2024000	The office asked for the approximate value.
2024000	2026000	Then I asked again.
2026000	2028000	Then I went to the interviewer.
2028000	2030000	Can you show me what you bought?
2030000	2032000	What did you buy?
2032000	2034000	Because I still have a point.
2034000	2036000	Many people tell me.
2036000	2038000	He bought a chicken.
2038000	2040000	Do business.
2040000	2042000	In fact, he went to sell chickens.
2042000	2044000	Because they fight chickens.
2044000	2046000	There is a girl who told me.
2046000	2048000	How much did he spend?
2048000	2050000	When I went home to count.
2050000	2052000	6,000 less.
2052000	2054000	So where did he spend 6,000?
2054000	2056000	You ask him directly.
2056000	2058000	Where is the missing 6,000?
2058000	2060000	It's embarrassing.
2060000	2062000	The next day, his friend invited me to drink coffee.
2062000	2064000	When I was working.
2064000	2066000	With a special man.
2066000	2068000	Come back to have a baby.
2068000	2070000	Not his husband.
2070000	2072000	So the 6,000 dollars.
2072000	2074000	In fact, it was a baby born in Australia.
2074000	2076000	It's too embarrassing.
2076000	2078000	He didn't want to tell me.
2078000	2080000	I said OK.
2080000	2082000	So I spent about 3,000.
2082000	2084000	Understand.
2084000	2086000	Another question.
2086000	2088000	Because this is like.
2088000	2090000	Is it back from Australia?
2090000	2092000	So it's a bit like.
2092000	2094000	I don't know if this question is right.
2094000	2096000	For those who are already.
2096000	2098000	For these local families.
2098000	2100000	It's like this.
2100000	2102000	So it's like this.
2102000	2104000	The ratio of income.
2104000	2106000	Is it also applicable to the general.
2106000	2108000	The ratio of income they originally had.
2108000	2110000	It should be said that.
2110000	2112000	The way they use this money.
2112000	2114000	It's different from the way they usually use money.
2114000	2116000	Or are they using the same.
2116000	2118000	Almost the same ratio.
2118000	2120000	This question.
2120000	2122000	You really know how to ask questions.
2122000	2124000	I think this is worth it.
2124000	2126000	1 million questions.
2126000	2128000	Because basically the islanders.
2128000	2130000	Do you know that their salary is very low?
2130000	2132000	So 150 dollars.
2132000	2134000	Basically, this money is for them.
2134000	2136000	Windfall fell from the sky.
2136000	2138000	Sit down money.
2138000	2140000	And a lot of people in the countryside.
2140000	2142000	They don't need money.
2142000	2144000	You have to imagine that Taiwan.
2144000	2146000	Even in the 50s and 60s.
2146000	2148000	They actually don't need money.
2148000	2150000	Because they are obligated.
2150000	2152000	It's said that there is often that.
2152000	2154000	We drove by.
2154000	2156000	My colleague is a documentary director.
2156000	2158000	He will talk a lot.
2158000	2160000	Hey, that sister.
2160000	2162000	I use candles to exchange corn with you, OK?
2162000	2164000	So they are basically still.
2164000	2166000	A lot of rural people are in the original economy.
2166000	2168000	So this money is for them.
2168000	2170000	Some of my workers.
2170000	2172000	They are.
2172000	2174000	Sent 6,000 yuan.
2174000	2176000	6,000 dollars back.
2176000	2178000	That's very big for them.
2178000	2180000	It's completely zero money.
2180000	2182000	The gift that fell from the sky.
2182000	2184000	Because they used to be.
2184000	2186000	What do you eat?
2186000	2188000	Maybe 100 times a month.
2188000	2190000	There is no such system.
2190000	2192000	So this is extra.
2192000	2194000	In addition to their livelihood system.
2196000	2198000	Can you answer this?
2198000	2200000	Because I will ask these two questions.
2200000	2202000	In fact, there is one in economics.
2202000	2204000	A very important theory.
2204000	2206000	If you say today.
2206000	2208000	Maybe your income today.
2208000	2210000	You may use this ratio to spend.
2210000	2212000	Then if you say today.
2212000	2214000	Give you 100 more.
2214000	2216000	It's like a hundred dollars that fell from the sky.
2216000	2218000	How do you make a choice?
2218000	2220000	It is very possible that you will spend a sum of money.
2220000	2222000	To invest or a sum of money.
2222000	2224000	When you get it.
2224000	2226000	Just spend it all.
2226000	2228000	You may want to save it.
2228000	2230000	Let you in the future.
2230000	2232000	Have a certain consumption.
2232000	2234000	So that your consumption can be smooth.
2234000	2236000	Let your overall life level go up.
2236000	2238000	But this thing is not always.
2238000	2240000	There should be some information.
2240000	2242000	But not like this.
2242000	2244000	A very good piece of information.
2244000	2246000	Because this state.
2246000	2248000	For us, it may be okay.
2248000	2250000	But for the locals.
2250000	2252000	This may be a big state.
2252000	2254000	How do you use it?
2254000	2256000	If the quality of the information is very good.
2256000	2258000	In fact, it is quite suitable.
2258000	2260000	So I will ask like this.
2260000	2262000	So I feel very curious.
2262000	2264000	Really.
2264000	2266000	So we see this pie chart.
2266000	2268000	In fact, I asked.
2268000	2270000	They did not mention buying food or what.
2270000	2272000	Because you usually want to buy food.
2272000	2274000	You go to kill your backyard chicken.
2274000	2276000	Or you go.
2276000	2278000	Use candles to exchange for corn.
2278000	2280000	All they talk about is.
2280000	2282000	I took this.
2282000	2284000	Is to build a house.
2284000	2286000	I bought a car.
2286000	2288000	Or what.
2288000	2290000	Then they did not even talk about buying a mobile phone.
2290000	2292000	At that time I was.
2292000	2294000	Fortunately, you asked.
2294000	2296000	I asked.
2296000	2298000	Don't a lot of people buy iphone?
2298000	2300000	Or what.
2300000	2302000	Then I found out.
2302000	2304000	I really live in the local area.
2304000	2306000	I found out.
2306000	2308000	I really ask.
2308000	2310000	You are too naive.
2310000	2312000	You know their network is super bad.
2312000	2314000	And everyone wants to buy that phone card and network.
2314000	2316000	Then they bought a mobile phone.
2316000	2318000	So a lot of people say.
2318000	2320000	He may be working here.
2320000	2322000	He wants to talk to his girlfriend.
2322000	2324000	He wants to buy a mobile phone for him.
2324000	2326000	A smart phone for his girlfriend.
2326000	2328000	But this is not a remittance.
2328000	2330000	It's because they've been working in Australia for a long time.
2330000	2332000	I bought it.
2332000	2334000	So those are gifts.
2334000	2336000	They brought it all back.
2336000	2338000	What rice cooker.
2338000	2340000	I was wondering why.
2340000	2342000	No electronic device.
2342000	2344000	But they actually bought it first.
2344000	2346000	So these are the ones.
2346000	2348000	Because these are the ones that can only be used locally.
2348000	2350000	So yeah.
2350000	2352000	This is probably.
2354000	2356000	And then later.
2356000	2358000	I've been living there for a long time.
2358000	2360000	I'll find out.
2360000	2362000	They're actually in the process of urbanization.
2362000	2364000	There are quietly going on.
2364000	2366000	Although they are urbanized.
2366000	2368000	About 30 percent.
2368000	2370000	About 70 percent.
2370000	2372000	Most of them still live in the countryside.
2372000	2374000	But in fact.
2374000	2376000	This transition is also happening.
2376000	2378000	From that general.
2378000	2380000	They actually have one.
2380000	2382000	The only shopping center in the country.
2382000	2384000	It's called Timo Plaza.
2384000	2386000	It's a bit like when I was still in Taiwan.
2386000	2388000	When I was in fifth or sixth grade.
2388000	2390000	My hometown is Taichung.
2390000	2392000	I go to the first square.
2392000	2394000	It was about 20 years ago.
2394000	2396000	The level of Taichung's first square.
2396000	2398000	I don't know what other areas are.
2398000	2400000	There are some.
2400000	2402000	Chinese businessmen from other places.
2402000	2404000	Come over there to sell some small things.
2404000	2406000	Or goods or something.
2406000	2408000	So basically a lot.
2408000	2410000	But most of them are.
2410000	2412000	Because of the war.
2412000	2414000	So a lot of that.
2414000	2416000	The road is the whole.
2416000	2418000	It was when the UN army came.
2418000	2420000	Get rid of it.
2420000	2422000	So a lot of countries like Japan.
2422000	2424000	JICA.
2424000	2426000	What exchange association.
2426000	2428000	I helped them in.
2428000	2430000	There are also Koka in Korea.
2430000	2432000	China's Belt and Road.
2432000	2434000	Also fixed a lot.
2434000	2436000	Of course there is.
2436000	2438000	USA in the United States of America.
2438000	2440000	Also have this.
2440000	2442000	So there are gradually roads in the countryside.
2442000	2444000	But this is a very sticky situation.
2444000	2446000	They have a road but no streetlights.
2446000	2448000	So I really.
2448000	2450000	It was a long adventure for me at the time.
2450000	2452000	If I go out at night.
2452000	2454000	I have to have a flashlight.
2454000	2456000	Otherwise it's pretty dangerous.
2456000	2458000	That's another one.
2458000	2460000	I think it makes me feel even more.
2460000	2462000	A big change is because.
2462000	2464000	According to Marx's theory.
2464000	2466000	Capital transfer.
2466000	2468000	Also.
2468000	2470000	How do you get the capital.
2470000	2472000	To support you.
2472000	2474000	Your own activity.
2474000	2476000	The change.
2476000	2478000	To see the change of this era.
2478000	2480000	So they also started from.
2480000	2482000	The.
2482000	2484000	Sell ​​small things in the market.
2484000	2486000	Also advanced.
2486000	2488000	That is to say.
2488000	2490000	Maybe it's like a sales service.
2490000	2492000	Like the one on my right.
2492000	2494000	There are buses.
2494000	2496000	So their buses.
2496000	2498000	This service is only available in the capital.
2498000	2500000	If I was going to the countryside.
2500000	2502000	I have to take a truck.
2502000	2504000	It's really a truck.
2504000	2506000	Then.
2506000	2508000	Because I'm a foreigner.
2508000	2510000	There will be some goods on the truck.
2510000	2512000	Like this.
2512000	2514000	If you want to take a truck.
2514000	2516000	You have to do it with the chicken and the sheep.
2516000	2518000	So I will.
2518000	2520000	If you use the power of money.
2520000	2522000	Then give me two more dollars.
2522000	2524000	I can sit next to him.
2524000	2526000	I don't have to.
2526000	2528000	Travel with animals.
2528000	2530000	Of course.
2530000	2532000	These workers.
2532000	2534000	A lot of money.
2534000	2536000	$6,000, $7,000, $10,000.
2536000	2538000	A lot in the local area.
2538000	2540000	I asked the least.
2540000	2542000	It's the kind.
2542000	2544000	He's not quite used to Australian life.
2544000	2546000	It's the first season.
2546000	2548000	He might only have 3,000.
2548000	2550000	But if it's the kind.
2550000	2552000	I've been to Australia four or five times.
2552000	2554000	They're very good.
2554000	2556000	They can save a year.
2556000	2558000	One season is six or seven months.
2558000	2560000	It's close to $20,000.
2560000	2562000	I want to say I'm a university professor.
2562000	2564000	I can't save that much.
2564000	2566000	I'm a moonlight group.
2566000	2568000	If you go back, you're basically considered.
2568000	2570000	It's a new father's class.
2570000	2572000	So this.
2572000	2574000	This is actually in.
2574000	2576000	In fact, in terms of local people.
2576000	2578000	This will break.
2578000	2580000	Break some.
2580000	2582000	Maybe that person.
2582000	2584000	He's usually in.
2584000	2586000	Uh, in the local society.
2586000	2588000	His original class.
2588000	2590000	It's not that.
2590000	2592000	And then he might go back.
2592000	2594000	With a lot of money.
2594000	2596000	Like Taiwan said.
2596000	2598000	Explosive or greedy.
2598000	2600000	It's just that feeling.
2600000	2602000	It's also a lot.
2602000	2604000	Uh, in the local area.
2604000	2606000	It's a hot topic.
2606000	2608000	Like I went to the countryside for an interview.
2608000	2610000	They want to say.
2610000	2612000	So that means I'm here to ask you.
2612000	2614000	Can I get into that?
2614000	2616000	They'll be right.
2616000	2618000	This thing is really going abroad to work.
2618000	2620000	Create an Australian dream.
2620000	2622000	This thing can be.
2622000	2624000	It's a way to make me rich in an instant.
2624000	2626000	But in fact.
2626000	2628000	When I was doing the interview.
2628000	2630000	I'll find out.
2630000	2632000	A lot of people.
2632000	2634000	I want to pursue this Australian dream.
2634000	2636000	But in the end, you're done.
2636000	2638000	We can see him build a house.
2638000	2640000	Progress.
2640000	2642000	Some people may be more.
2642000	2644000	So he might have gone.
2644000	2646000	Two seasons.
2646000	2648000	About 10,000.
2648000	2650000	And then the house on the left.
2650000	2652000	Just build a small house.
2652000	2654000	But some people may be ambitious.
2654000	2656000	Or what?
2656000	2658000	Like this house.
2658000	2660000	That's the backyard of our house.
2660000	2662000	He also went to Australia.
2662000	2664000	But because it seems like only one season.
2664000	2666000	Or what?
2666000	2668000	It's just that the money hasn't been sent back.
2668000	2670000	The whole house is embarrassing.
2670000	2672000	So his house has no roof.
2672000	2674000	He can only live on the first floor.
2674000	2676000	The second floor has not been returned because of the money.
2676000	2678000	And then maybe my wife is.
2678000	2680000	The second floor has no roof.
2680000	2682000	The whole house can't be built.
2682000	2684000	So this is actually.
2684000	2686000	There is the so-called.
2686000	2688000	That kind of meeting effect.
2688000	2690000	But the meeting effect.
2690000	2692000	Is there really that much?
2692000	2694000	Or can it always be a continuous thing?
2694000	2696000	It is also necessary to see.
2696000	2698000	Or there is.
2698000	2700000	In Taiwan, we are in the Japanese era.
2700000	2702000	There is self-love.
2702000	2704000	But not in Tokyo until now.
2704000	2706000	To my picture below.
2706000	2708000	The picture is standing next to the Tokyo girl.
2708000	2710000	It's Australia and the Tokyo flag.
2710000	2712000	This word is called Beirun.
2712000	2714000	Beirun means water well.
2714000	2716000	So the Australians donated a well here.
2716000	2718000	That's in the urban area.
2718000	2720000	What are they doing in line?
2720000	2722000	They are queuing for water.
2722000	2724000	Because only foreigners live.
2724000	2726000	Or high-ranking families.
2726000	2728000	There is tap water.
2728000	2730000	That's usually.
2730000	2732000	A group of people is going to.
2732000	2734000	Water station.
2734000	2736000	Or the water tower to get water.
2736000	2738000	What do they usually drink?
2738000	2740000	They are the main water.
2740000	2742000	Or buy that kind of imported water.
2742000	2744000	I remember when I was there.
2744000	2746000	The first thing I wake up every morning.
2746000	2748000	I opened my faucet.
2748000	2750000	Because I was sitting.
2750000	2752000	In the house of the British consul.
2752000	2754000	Then I opened the faucet.
2754000	2756000	There is water.
2756000	2758000	I just put that pool of water.
2758000	2760000	I just.
2760000	2762000	There is something like a piece of water.
2762000	2764000	Then I use that water all day.
2764000	2766000	To brush your teeth.
2766000	2768000	Wash your face.
2768000	2770000	Then I go to the supermarket.
2770000	2772000	Buy water.
2772000	2774000	So basically a lot of people.
2774000	2776000	After working home.
2776000	2778000	The first thing they see when they buy a house.
2778000	2780000	Like Taiwanese people look at the location.
2780000	2782000	Did you enter the train station?
2782000	2784000	What is the bus station?
2784000	2786000	Their first preference.
2786000	2788000	Enter the water tower.
2788000	2790000	There must be a well and a water tower next to it.
2790000	2792000	Because there is no tap water.
2792000	2794000	This is also a very different thing.
2794000	2796000	Then I have this picture below.
2796000	2798000	There is a German-Austrian geography.
2798000	2800000	Annual photography award.
2800000	2802000	That is.
2802000	2804000	They.
2804000	2806000	I was in the market at that time.
2806000	2808000	Take a truck to the side.
2808000	2810000	When I was doing a rural interview.
2810000	2812000	I took a sneak shot.
2812000	2814000	Their truck is usually a bit like.
2814000	2816000	Thai song.
2816000	2818000	Or the Philippine tattoo.
2818000	2820000	Everyone will sit in the back.
2820000	2822000	Then the driver sits in front.
2822000	2824000	Then there is no sign or anything.
2824000	2826000	So you just follow the water.
2826000	2828000	But my interviewee.
2828000	2830000	When he came back.
2830000	2832000	Bought a truck.
2832000	2834000	He said he wanted to do this business.
2834000	2836000	Because in a public transportation.
2836000	2838000	A very underdeveloped place.
2838000	2840000	You can move.
2840000	2842000	In fact, to some extent.
2842000	2844000	There is a way.
2844000	2846000	Generate more wealth.
2846000	2848000	Is to be able to let your.
2848000	2850000	Economic capital continues.
2850000	2852000	A very important element.
2852000	2854000	Then here again.
2854000	2856000	Back to what I just said.
2856000	2858000	In fact, some people may want to.
2858000	2860000	Come back and do business.
2860000	2862000	What.
2862000	2864000	Some people do it.
2864000	2866000	Tourism industry.
2866000	2868000	But their tourism industry is.
2868000	2870000	There is an empty environment.
2870000	2872000	It's very underdeveloped.
2872000	2874000	It's not easy to go to Tokyo.
2874000	2876000	There are only three places to fly.
2876000	2878000	One is from Australia.
2878000	2880000	Darwin.
2880000	2882000	Darwin is a base.
2882000	2884000	It was a military base before.
2884000	2886000	That place.
2886000	2888000	And only Australia Airlines.
2888000	2890000	Qantas Air North.
2890000	2892000	Next is from Singapore.
2892000	2894000	The last one is from Bali.
2894000	2896000	Bali is actually the most.
2896000	2898000	Most people fly.
2898000	2900000	Then I flew directly from Australia.
2900000	2902000	Then come back to Bali.
2902000	2904000	So the plane.
2904000	2906000	It's not easy to fly.
2906000	2908000	Very few tourists come.
2908000	2910000	That is.
2910000	2912000	Domestic tourists.
2912000	2914000	It's not enough to support this.
2914000	2916000	So they.
2916000	2918000	The official has been telling me.
2918000	2920000	Can you write an article about tourism?
2920000	2922000	Let more people come.
2922000	2924000	I just want to say.
2924000	2926000	But it's not like that.
2926000	2928000	The West will want to go to Tokyo.
2928000	2930000	The feeling of spending money.
2930000	2932000	It's a big adventure.
2932000	2934000	That kind of feeling.
2934000	2936000	Because they are actually like.
2936000	2938000	Many areas in Southeast Asia.
2938000	2940000	Fighters are banned.
2940000	2942000	We know that Indonesia is actually a.
2942000	2944000	Go home country.
2944000	2946000	In addition to the fighters in Bali.
2946000	2948000	Other places will call the mayor.
2948000	2950000	But the fighters in Tokyo.
2950000	2952000	Basically every day.
2952000	2954000	That's their rule.
2954000	2956000	The rule is.
2956000	2958000	I'll have a video later.
2958000	2960000	The chicken will become.
2960000	2962000	Dinner that day.
2962000	2964000	If you win the chicken.
2964000	2966000	Because they're in the chicken's leg.
2966000	2968000	Remember the chicken's leg.
2968000	2970000	A knife.
2970000	2972000	So if you lose, it becomes dinner.
2972000	2974000	Then if you win, you can.
2974000	2976000	Survive and then tomorrow.
2976000	2978000	Continue the next round tomorrow.
2978000	2980000	So a lot of people are actually.
2980000	2982000	In.
2982000	2984000	Get those things back.
2984000	2986000	In addition to doing these meaningful things.
2986000	2988000	A lot of people actually use it to gamble.
2988000	2990000	Or do something.
2990000	2992000	Make you happy.
2992000	2994000	Spend.
2994000	2996000	But every time I'm with the West.
2996000	2998000	I'll say this.
2998000	3000000	This is like our Melbourne car.
3000000	3002000	Go to SEMA.
3002000	3004000	You go to a bar or something.
3004000	3006000	But this is the local version.
3006000	3008000	Let's take a look.
3008000	3010000	Fighters.
3012000	3014000	Wait a minute.
3014000	3016000	So let's take a look at the Fighters.
3016000	3018000	Wait a minute.
3018000	3020000	That's what I put on the left.
3020000	3022000	It's a bucket shower.
3022000	3024000	I was in the east.
3024000	3026000	Ask how to take a shower.
3034000	3036000	This is a bucket shower.
3036000	3038000	Fighters.
3044000	3046000	Wait a minute.
3046000	3048000	Wait a minute.
3048000	3050000	Wait a minute.
3050000	3052000	Wait a minute.
3052000	3054000	Wait a minute.
3068000	3070000	Let's talk about it.
3070000	3072000	Let's talk about it.
3072000	3074000	Yes.
3074000	3076000	There was a chicken.
3076000	3077000	A little accidentally picked.
3077000	3081000	And then the chicken was left to the side for dinner.
3082000	3084000	I was on the left picture.
3084000	3086000	I am our sponsor.
3086000	3088000	Come back he opened the ghost.
3088000	3090000	Really like Taiwan 450 years ago.
3090000	3092000	You are just in that window that man.
3092000	3094000	And tell the old lady.
3094000	3096000	Hey, what I want?
3096000	3098000	Hey, I asked my woman that person bought something.
3098000	3102000	She said she bought a bottle of gutebebe chili sauce and a envelope.
3103000	3105000	So they are basically that kind of small particlularly.
3105000	3106000	It's like this.
3106000	3108000	The whole thing on the top is the shampoo.
3108000	3111000	Because they actually only have to go on a date.
3111000	3112000	When is it?
3112000	3114000	When do you wash your hair with shampoo?
3114000	3116000	That's why they usually take a shower.
3116000	3118000	I just use cold water.
3118000	3120000	So when you wash your hair, you use a small bag.
3120000	3122000	And then because I'm a foreigner.
3122000	3126000	So sometimes I go to visit our OZ corner.
3126000	3128000	We have an Australian supermarket.
3128000	3131000	See if we can buy Australian milk.
3131000	3133000	Then we'll see.
3133000	3135000	These are our little friends.
3145000	3148000	This is their daily game.
3148000	3150000	And then I just put some.
3150000	3153000	I wrote some articles myself.
3153000	3154000	If you are interested.
3154000	3157000	And the Australian ABC has interviewed me.
3157000	3158000	Chinese experience.
3158000	3161000	If you are interested, you can take a look.
3163000	3165000	Wow!
3177000	3180000	The black one next to it is a pig.
3180000	3182000	Their pigs are pretty thin.
3182000	3184000	Because people can't eat enough.
3184000	3187000	So the pigs are also very thin.
3187000	3188000	Yeah.
3188000	3190000	So that's about what I wanted to share today.
3190000	3192000	If you have any questions.
3192000	3194000	You are welcome to discuss it together.
3194000	3196000	Thank you everyone.
3196000	3197000	Thank you.
3197000	3199000	Annie's speech was really, really exciting.
3199000	3201000	I really think it's very, very interesting.
3201000	3203000	Then I want to ask.
3203000	3206000	If the audience has any questions.
3206000	3208000	You can ask them at this time.
3208000	3210000	Then.
3210000	3211000	Or this is good.
3211000	3212000	Because our speech is almost.
3212000	3214000	I can stop recording first.
3214000	3216000	Then everyone can be more free.
3216000	3218000	If you want to ask questions, you can.
3219000	3221000	If you are here, thank you again.
3221000	3222000	Annie's speech today.
3222000	3224000	Thank you.
