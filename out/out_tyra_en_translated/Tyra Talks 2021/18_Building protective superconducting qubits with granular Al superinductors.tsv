0	17000	Welcome to today's TARTalk. We are honored to have Dr. Ronson to talk about his research on quantum bit during his Ph.D. class.
17000	21000	Before we start, let me introduce today's speaker.
21000	26000	Dr. Ronson graduated from Rochester University in the east of the United States this year.
26000	33000	His work in his Ph.D. class is mainly to use superconducting man-made atoms to achieve protective superconducting qubits.
33000	38000	Before his Ph.D. class, he worked in the 3D IC department of TSMC for two and a half years.
38000	45000	He just finished his Ph.D. class and got his degree.
45000	54000	He will move to IBM Research as a Research Scientist and continue to develop and integrate his most specialized superconducting quantum chips.
54000	60000	At the same time, he is also one of the members of the Qiskit Advocate of the IBM Q promotion plan.
60000	69000	In addition to his main superconducting qubit research, he is also very committed to developing quantum education and games with Qiskit.
69000	74000	Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.
74000	77000	Let's welcome Dr. Ronson to give us today's speech with a warm applause.
77000	91000	Dr. Ronson, thank you for giving me this opportunity to share with you.
91000	96000	You can see my laser pointer.
97000	100000	Thank you.
100000	104000	What I'm going to share with you today is my work at the Ph.D. class.
104000	108000	There are three parts of my work at the Ph.D. class.
108000	115000	The first part is Low-EJ's Josephson-Johnson superconductor.
115000	124000	The third part is the prototype of a quantum circuit.
124000	127000	We call it bifloxone qubit.
127000	137000	Because junction is a little boring, and there are some time constraints, I won't mention junction.
137000	145000	The main focus is on the bifloxone circuit and a more important component in it, the superconductor.
145000	148000	Dr. Ronson is here again.
148000	151000	This circuit is very similar to the bifloxone circuit.
151000	159000	It's just that the black-shift junction is changed to a cooper-pair box, and the gate is used to connect.
159000	170000	Because I do Fab, not design, I will try to explain the circuit.
170000	177000	But there may be some Hamiltonian behind the theory.
177000	180000	Because of time constraints, I won't mention too much.
180000	183000	I'm not a specialist in quantum circuits.
183000	187000	You can discuss any questions you have.
187000	194000	Because not everyone here is doing qubit, I will briefly mention it.
194000	206000	In quantum computation technology, especially in qubit hardware, there are mainly five criteria.
206000	214000	These are the five criteria proposed by Dr. Ronson in 2000.
214000	224000	The first two are circuit depth, which is how long a circuit can run before the signal disappears.
224000	227000	So you can put a few gates before the signal disappears.
227000	230000	The other criteria is the number of qubits.
230000	237000	So Dr. Ronson's work is more like de-extending the circuit depth of super-canon qubit.
237000	245000	That is to say, try to increase our either coherent time or dephasing time.
245000	254000	Here is a recent meme, a web meme.
254000	258000	It summarizes the paper of super-canon qubit.
258000	262000	Now we can see that there are 12 kinds of papers.
262000	270000	Dr. Ronson's work is basically located in these three papers.
270000	273000	He wrote that Johnson and Johnson can do so many things.
273000	275000	This is my first work.
275000	281000	The second is to realize super-inductors, impossible inductors.
281000	285000	The third one is our prototype.
285000	288000	We made a new qubit and it is awful.
288000	291000	Just kidding.
291000	297000	This is my work at Dr. Ronson's lab.
297000	301000	The first one is super-inductors.
301000	310000	We try to realize super-inductors with granular aluminum.
310000	316000	The second one is super-inductors based on Johnson to realize bifluxon qubits.
316000	320000	The third one is super-inductors based on granular aluminum to realize bifluxon qubits.
320000	323000	This is an ongoing project.
323000	326000	Maybe we can talk about it later.
326000	329000	But today's main focus is these two.
329000	334000	Basically, this page is a brief introduction of Johnson.
334000	337000	Johnson is basically a capacitor.
337000	341000	Its two sides are super-conductors.
341000	346000	There is a thin layer of aluminum oxide in the middle.
346000	350000	In our device, we use aluminum-based.
350000	357000	We use a shadow mask to grow an aluminum layer in one direction.
357000	360000	Then introduce some oxygen into the vacuum chamber.
360000	364000	Then another layer of aluminum is cut in the other direction.
365000	367000	This is Johnson.
367000	373000	Johnson can be represented by three elements on the model.
373000	379000	One of them will affect the resistance of the circuit damping.
379000	384000	There is also a capacitor and a non-linear inductor.
384000	389000	The characteristic energy of the capacitor and the inductor is
389000	394000	Q2 over 2C
394000	402000	This is the energy generated by the Johnson effect.
402000	407000	Johnson effect basically describes
407000	414000	You can use the phase difference of the super-current on both sides of Johnson as a parameter.
414000	418000	To parameterize the characteristics of the circuit element IV.
418000	423000	Its current and voltage can be parameterized by phase.
423000	427000	Then you can get its characteristic energy.
427000	432000	In practice, what Johnson I did today
432000	434000	How much is the resistance of the two sides of the circuit?
434000	437000	It is inversely proportional to Ej.
437000	444000	Ej and Ec can be used in classical physics.
445000	452000	You can think of it as the kinetic energy and potential energy in classical physics.
452000	458000	Ej is like a potential energy in phase representation.
458000	460000	Ec is like kinetic energy.
460000	469000	When the quantity of Ej and Ec is in the correct position
469000	472000	When Ej and Ec are comparable
472000	475000	Because of the quantum confinement effect
475000	480000	We can observe the generation of energy levels.
480000	489000	In quantum computation, we take the first and zeroth connection to do the operation.
489000	494000	For example, if the energy level is non-equally spaced today
494000	501000	You can use the microwave to address the ground state and the first excited state more accurately.
501000	507000	This is the basic concept of quantum computation using superconducting artificial atoms.
511000	523000	I just mentioned that Ej can be compared to kinetic energy and potential energy.
524000	528000	In classical physics, we know that kinetic energy and potential energy
528000	533000	Because of the mathematical structure of kinetic energy and potential energy
533000	538000	We can expect them to represent their own bases.
538000	547000	For example, the kinetic energy base is the kinetic energy, and the unknown base is the unknown.
547000	552000	Therefore, P and delta P and delta X will follow the computational relation.
552000	555000	You can expect them to have certain principles.
555000	560000	There is a similar phenomenon in superconducting circuits.
560000	570000	We use the basis of charging energy, which is the number of cooper pairs.
570000	579000	And the basis of Josephine energy, which is the parameterized supercurrent phase.
579000	589000	These two operators will also follow the so-called oscillating principle.
589000	600000	In superconducting circuits, we are more concerned about charging energy.
600000	613000	If we want to minimize the charge noise, we need to maximize the phase fluctuation.
613000	628000	To maximize the phase fluctuation, we need to compress the energy spectrum into a parabola.
628000	634000	Therefore, we need a large inductance to flatten the parabola.
634000	640000	In this way, we can get a relatively low charge sensitivity.
640000	649000	This is why we want to make a superconductor.
649000	661000	Traditionally, in semiconductor, the way to make a superconductor is to make a line.
661000	665000	The thinner the line, the larger the inductance.
665000	674000	Last year, there was a paper to demonstrate how large the inductance can be.
674000	684000	This paper realized about 1 uH and 30 kΩ.
684000	689000	The reason why kΩ impedance is an important parameter is that
689000	697000	we want a superconductor to operate at a certain frequency.
697000	702000	We want the superconductor to maintain an inductive response.
702000	721000	That is to say, the operating frequency must be higher than the operating frequency.
721000	730000	This resonant frequency can be used to equal 1 over square of LC.
730000	736000	That is to say, if you have a large L and the corresponding F is fixed,
736000	741000	your specific capacitance must be small enough.
741000	745000	This will correspond to a high enough impedance.
745000	749000	The reason why impedance is an important parameter is because of this.
749000	757000	This paper demonstrates that it is already a limit.
757000	760000	Because the black part of the device is hollowed out.
760000	764000	However, it is quite difficult to do this.
764000	771000	To make a device of hundreds of microns in size and hollow out the substrate,
771000	777000	leaving only a very thin dielectric, is very challenging.
777000	786000	Generally, we use superconducting kinetic inductance to do this.
786000	788000	Here is an example of what we do in our lab.
788000	790000	We use a material called granular aluminum.
790000	793000	We will see a simple structure of it later.
793000	808000	This material is provided by Cooper-Pear kinetic inductance.
808000	811000	On the other hand, we use Johnson-Johnson inductance.
811000	826000	I forgot the name of the professor.
826000	829000	This is Professor Lin's lab.
829000	832000	This is made by Maruchan and his group.
832000	837000	This is the largest inductance in the world.
837000	841000	It is 2.5 microhenry with an impedance of up to 200 kΩ.
841000	847000	The way they do this is to remove the entire Johnson-Johnson substrate.
847000	850000	It is similar to the concept of suspended graphene.
850000	852000	After removing the oxide at the bottom,
852000	858000	and over-etching, the metal will rise up due to the force.
858000	864000	By doing this, you can remove the substrate and get a very high impedance.
864000	870000	This is provided by Johnson-Johnson superconductor.
870000	877000	This is a simple description of why we need a superconductor.
877000	885000	These are some of the challenges we face in superkinetic qubit.
886000	892000	Whichever is smaller, either T1 or T2,
892000	898000	the shortest decoherence is not equal to Tg.
898000	905000	The number of times a circuit can operate is the so-called circuit depth.
905000	908000	What we need to do is to try to extend the circuit depth.
909000	924000	The next thing I want to talk about is how to extend the circuit depth.
924000	928000	One way is to use parity protection.
929000	931000	The concept of parity protection is...
931000	934000	Sorry, let me first talk about what T1 and T2 are,
934000	939000	and what we are focusing on in this talk.
939000	943000	T1 and T2 are a number in the NMR system.
943000	954000	T1 refers to how long it takes for a qubit or electron to be excited to the first excited state,
954000	956000	and how long it takes for it to relax back.
956000	960000	If this is a block sphere in a qubit,
960000	971000	the physical picture is that when you excite from 0 to 1,
971000	975000	after a certain amount of time, the ball will slowly shrink back to 0.
975000	989000	Defacing is more like how to decoherence the information on the face of the xy plane.
991000	994000	We are mainly talking about the relaxation of T1,
994000	1003000	which is to say, how to suppress from 1 to 0 before 0 to 1.
1004000	1017000	I have made a brief video on how to realize 0 and 1 in superconducting qubits.
1017000	1019000	This is a device for charge qubits.
1019000	1026000	It can be written as 4EC times the number of qubit pairs,
1026000	1029000	which is the number of qubit pairs on the island.
1030000	1038000	In this structure, we can see that when n is equal to 0,
1038000	1041000	it means that there is 0 charge on the island,
1041000	1043000	and when n is equal to 1, it means that there is 1 charge on the island.
1043000	1046000	There will be individual parabola corresponding to this.
1048000	1051000	For example, if you are 0 today, your energy should look like this.
1051000	1054000	When there is 1 charge on the island, it looks like this.
1054000	1059000	In fact, the energy is the number of qubit pairs you add up,
1059000	1064000	and the whole charge is your charging energy.
1066000	1070000	If there is a charge running on the island today,
1070000	1074000	we expect that your energy will jump from here to here.
1076000	1079000	For example, you have some quasi-particle tunneling.
1079000	1082000	On the other hand, you will have some local charge noise.
1082000	1086000	If you have some local noise today,
1086000	1090000	your energy will jump from here to here.
1092000	1100000	At this time, if I turn on Jordan-Johnson tunneling today,
1100000	1106000	I just saw that Jordan-Johnson is a capacitor.
1106000	1109000	The energy diagram we expect looks like this.
1109000	1113000	If I turn on Jordan-Johnson effect today,
1113000	1122000	what we see is that we will have so-called anti-level crossing,
1122000	1125000	and then you will have 0 state and 1 state.
1126000	1133000	In this case, it is a similar situation in our system,
1133000	1137000	but we only use flux as the basis.
1138000	1146000	What we are actually observing is the so-called flux zone.
1146000	1154000	The concept of flux zone is the circulation in the circuit today,
1154000	1163000	which is your super-current phase winding.
1163000	1166000	For example, if you have a flux zone tunnel today,
1166000	1169000	your super-current will have an extra graph,
1169000	1173000	and your phase will have an extra graph wrapping.
1174000	1178000	The concept of flux zone is used to...
1178000	1180000	As I mentioned earlier,
1184000	1188000	the concept of protection today is...
1188000	1191000	Let's say we have a system today,
1191000	1195000	which is completely invisible to each other between 0 and 1.
1195000	1196000	In other words,
1197000	1198000	I have a...
1200000	1201000	Let's put it this way.
1201000	1206000	Basically, if we play today...
1206000	1212000	Because of this Jordan-Johnson tunneling,
1212000	1216000	what will happen is that it allows you to jump from 0 to 1,
1216000	1221000	but you can also jump from 1 to 0 because of the coupling with the outside world.
1223000	1225000	But if we have a switch today,
1225000	1231000	we can put the system between 0 and 1.
1232000	1234000	Because in this case,
1234000	1241000	let's say we have a degeneracy.
1242000	1244000	Basically, when I open 0 and 1 today,
1244000	1248000	that is, when the switching system is in a different situation,
1248000	1250000	I can do...
1250000	1254000	When I want to read and write the system today,
1254000	1258000	I can do 0 and 1 writing.
1258000	1260000	When I want to read today,
1260000	1263000	I can let the system enter the so-called protective state.
1264000	1265000	At this time,
1267000	1269000	the signal will be preserved.
1269000	1273000	It can be preserved better.
1274000	1276000	I may not have done a good job.
1276000	1281000	I tried to use the concept of degeneracy to explain,
1281000	1283000	but the effect may not be very good.
1283000	1284000	But basically,
1284000	1289000	if we write it down...
1289000	1291000	Vincent, sorry.
1292000	1293000	Vincent, sorry.
1293000	1295000	Can I ask a question?
1295000	1296000	Yes, you can.
1296000	1297000	Hello.
1297000	1299000	Can I go back to the last page?
1299000	1300000	Yes.
1302000	1304000	I want to ask you...
1305000	1308000	This seems to be a very basic thing.
1308000	1312000	So when you do the rotational...
1312000	1314000	Because the part below you,
1314000	1316000	minus one-half EJ,
1316000	1318000	is your transition,
1318000	1319000	right?
1319000	1321000	Then the above is basically
1321000	1324000	the amount of charge
1324000	1328000	on your island.
1328000	1330000	If...
1330000	1332000	We discussed it last time.
1332000	1334000	When you do it,
1334000	1336000	you should also see some charge drop.
1336000	1339000	It should be on the top.
1339000	1342000	It affects NG here.
1342000	1346000	So when you do rotation with approximation,
1346000	1349000	it should eliminate the above.
1349000	1353000	But if it's charge drop,
1353000	1355000	the frequency it affects
1355000	1357000	will probably affect
1357000	1362000	the order of magnitude.
1364000	1366000	My understanding is...
1366000	1368000	I'm not doing charge qubit.
1368000	1370000	But my understanding is
1370000	1372000	it's effective the same.
1372000	1374000	It won't affect.
1374000	1375000	Why?
1375000	1377000	So the above...
1377000	1379000	4EC N-NG square.
1379000	1382000	This basically turns it into frequency.
1382000	1384000	So you want to do
1384000	1386000	rotation with approximation?
1388000	1389000	Yes.
1389000	1390000	OK.
1390000	1392000	But...
1392000	1393000	OK.
1393000	1395000	But there's a shift.
1395000	1397000	It affects the picture.
1401000	1404000	I think it's probably calibrated.
1404000	1405000	OK.
1405000	1407000	So let's say...
1407000	1409000	You usually put
1409000	1411000	1,000 electrons.
1411000	1413000	Then you jump an electron.
1413000	1415000	Your frequency jump
1415000	1418000	is about one-third of the jump.
1418000	1420000	How much is that?
1420000	1422000	Two-thirds?
1422000	1424000	Because it's N square.
1424000	1426000	So I don't know...
1426000	1428000	I should say...
1428000	1430000	I think I should say...
1430000	1431000	I don't know...
1431000	1434000	It's under rotation with approximation.
1434000	1436000	In fact,
1437000	1439000	I don't know how to do calibration.
1439000	1441000	So I can't comment.
1441000	1443000	Sorry.
1443000	1444000	Yes.
1444000	1446000	But my understanding is
1446000	1448000	it's...
1454000	1456000	In fact, charge jump
1456000	1460000	happens for a long time.
1460000	1462000	So we actually
1462000	1464000	don't really...
1464000	1466000	If you really meet it,
1466000	1468000	you're not very lucky.
1468000	1470000	But we usually
1470000	1472000	take it as
1472000	1474000	the main calibration.
1474000	1476000	So we don't worry about it.
1476000	1478000	It's just that it takes a long time.
1478000	1479000	For example,
1479000	1480000	10 milliseconds,
1480000	1481000	you'll see it once.
1481000	1483000	10 milliseconds, you'll see it once.
1483000	1485000	But if you see it,
1485000	1487000	because we basically do single shot,
1487000	1489000	so we don't really worry about it.
1489000	1491000	So I'm not very convinced.
1491000	1492000	Got it.
1492000	1493000	OK.
1493000	1494000	It doesn't matter.
1494000	1495000	Keep going.
1495000	1496000	Thank you.
1496000	1497000	OK.
1497000	1498000	Sorry.
1498000	1500000	Then I'll...
1500000	1502000	I'll talk about it more smoothly
1502000	1503000	this week.
1503000	1505000	Because this week...
1505000	1507000	Basically, we...
1509000	1511000	Our basic concept is
1511000	1513000	we're in Flux on Parity.
1513000	1515000	I'm going to build a mechanism
1515000	1517000	in my circuit
1517000	1519000	to turn on and turn off
1519000	1520000	my protection.
1520000	1522000	Suppose I...
1522000	1524000	The concept of on and off protection
1524000	1526000	comes from what I just said.
1526000	1528000	Suppose it's a degeneracy lifting.
1528000	1529000	That is to say,
1529000	1531000	suppose my system has degeneracy.
1531000	1533000	Then I can somehow prevent
1533000	1535000	the degenerated ground state
1535000	1537000	between the two.
1537000	1539000	They can communicate
1539000	1541000	between the two.
1541000	1543000	Suppose I have this ability.
1543000	1545000	Then I can do one thing.
1545000	1547000	That is, I can
1547000	1549000	preserve the data
1549000	1551000	in the protected state.
1551000	1553000	In the unprotected state.
1553000	1555000	That is, I can disable this protection.
1555000	1557000	Then it has degeneracy lifting.
1557000	1559000	Then we can do
1559000	1561000	0 and 1 read and write.
1561000	1563000	Then this is a...
1563000	1565000	a...
1565000	1566000	a concept.
1566000	1568000	Then our work this time is
1568000	1570000	a proof of concept.
1570000	1571000	Then we actually use
1571000	1573000	the mechanism I just said.
1573000	1575000	It's the so-called Aruna-Kesher effect.
1575000	1577000	Aruna-Kesher effect is basically
1577000	1579000	Aruna-Bohm effect
1579000	1581000	which is a dual version of Aruna-Bohm.
1581000	1583000	Imagine that
1583000	1585000	Aruna-Bohm is
1585000	1587000	an electron in the gas.
1587000	1589000	Then there are some
1589000	1591000	non-zero vector potentials in it.
1591000	1593000	When the electron propagates,
1593000	1595000	it will have
1595000	1597000	destructive or
1597000	1599000	constructive interference
1599000	1601000	because of this vector potential.
1601000	1603000	Then Aruna-Kesher effect
1603000	1605000	refers to a fluxon.
1605000	1607000	When it is tunneling,
1607000	1609000	there is a junction on the left or right
1609000	1611000	to do tunneling.
1611000	1613000	In the process of tunneling,
1613000	1615000	how many charges
1615000	1617000	exist on this island
1617000	1619000	will have some impact.
1619000	1621000	In the case of
1621000	1623000	a single electron,
1623000	1625000	this tunneling will have
1625000	1627000	destructive interference
1627000	1629000	which suppresses the
1629000	1631000	tunneling of a single fluxon.
1631000	1633000	The specific performance
1633000	1635000	in Hamiltonian
1635000	1637000	is that
1637000	1639000	there are two
1639000	1641000	degenerate ground states
1641000	1643000	in the optimized point.
1643000	1645000	However,
1645000	1647000	these two states
1647000	1649000	cannot see each other.
1649000	1651000	This is why
1651000	1653000	we call it
1653000	1655000	parity protection.
1665000	1667000	So,
1667000	1669000	do you have any
1669000	1671000	questions
1671000	1673000	or
1673000	1675000	need to explain more clearly?
1675000	1677000	If not,
1677000	1679000	let's move on to the first part.
1679000	1681000	The superconductor.
1681000	1683000	The superconductor of quantum mechanics.
1683000	1685000	OK.
1685000	1687000	I will continue to explain.
1689000	1691000	I just mentioned
1691000	1693000	how to
1693000	1695000	realize the circuit.
1695000	1697000	A very important element
1697000	1699000	is to
1699000	1701000	make the
1701000	1703000	superconductor.
1703000	1705000	The superconductor
1705000	1707000	is made of
1707000	1709000	granular aluminum.
1709000	1711000	Its microscopic structure
1711000	1713000	is like this.
1713000	1715000	The red one is aluminum,
1715000	1717000	and the green one is aluminum oxide.
1717000	1719000	The way to
1719000	1721000	grow it is
1721000	1723000	to add some oxygen
1723000	1725000	to the argon plasma
1725000	1727000	during the sputter process.
1727000	1729000	Then,
1729000	1731000	pressurize
1731000	1733000	about 1%
1733000	1735000	to 1%
1735000	1737000	of the concentration.
1737000	1739000	Then,
1739000	1741000	we can get a structure like this.
1741000	1743000	The grain size is usually
1743000	1745000	about 3 to 4 nanometers.
1745000	1747000	This graph shows
1747000	1749000	the experimental data
1749000	1751000	extracted from
1751000	1753000	the literature.
1753000	1755000	This graph shows
1755000	1757000	the TCE and resistivity.
1757000	1759000	We can see that
1759000	1761000	as the resistivity increases,
1761000	1763000	the TCE
1763000	1765000	starts to grow.
1765000	1767000	The pure aluminum
1767000	1769000	is about 1.3K.
1769000	1771000	Then, it will grow to 2K.
1771000	1773000	In different degrees,
1773000	1775000	we can get different films.
1775000	1777000	The grain size is different.
1777000	1779000	The maximum TCE
1779000	1781000	can reach 3K.
1781000	1783000	However, when we continue
1783000	1785000	to increase the resistivity,
1785000	1787000	the TCE will not grow.
1787000	1789000	It will not have
1789000	1791000	the so-called
1791000	1793000	disorderly induced
1793000	1795000	SI transition.
1795000	1797000	Why do we need to increase
1797000	1799000	the resistivity?
1799000	1801000	The reason is that
1801000	1803000	kinetic inductance
1803000	1805000	can increase
1805000	1807000	the resistance.
1807000	1809000	This is the
1809000	1811000	experimental demo
1811000	1813000	of a sub-inductor.
1813000	1815000	We basically made it
1815000	1817000	into a resonator structure
1817000	1819000	to measure its
1819000	1821000	resonant frequency.
1821000	1823000	Then, we can get
1823000	1825000	its inductance.
1825000	1827000	We got an impedance
1827000	1829000	of about 30kΩ
1829000	1831000	and an inductor
1831000	1833000	of 1.3uH.
1833000	1835000	Here are some details
1835000	1837000	about the application.
1837000	1839000	This is the resistivity
1839000	1841000	as a function of oxygen flow.
1841000	1843000	We later found that
1843000	1845000	the more accurate method
1845000	1847000	is to use a flow meter
1847000	1849000	instead of oxygen pressure.
1849000	1851000	If you are interested in
1851000	1853000	the details,
1853000	1855000	we can talk about it
1855000	1857000	in more detail later.
1857000	1859000	The resistivity we made
1859000	1861000	can be controlled
1861000	1863000	by a flow meter.
1863000	1865000	We just mentioned
1865000	1867000	that we made it
1867000	1869000	into a resonator structure.
1869000	1871000	The black part is
1871000	1873000	the granular aluminum.
1873000	1875000	The white part is the pure aluminum.
1875000	1877000	We made it
1877000	1879000	into a resonator
1879000	1881000	of half-wavelength
1881000	1883000	called planar waveguide geometry.
1883000	1885000	Then, we threw it into the fridge
1885000	1887000	to measure its
1887000	1889000	resonant frequency.
1889000	1891000	We extracted
1891000	1893000	the quality factor.
1893000	1895000	We further
1895000	1897000	characterized the quality factor
1897000	1899000	as a function of temperature.
1899000	1901000	We got
1901000	1903000	a feature
1903000	1905000	of the quality factor
1905000	1907000	which is
1907000	1909000	a line
1909000	1911000	that does not change
1911000	1913000	with temperature
1913000	1915000	when it is
1915000	1917000	below 250kΩ.
1917000	1919000	We observed
1919000	1921000	that it is
1921000	1923000	an exponentially
1923000	1925000	decaying
1925000	1927000	quality factor.
1927000	1929000	It is
1929000	1931000	similar to
1931000	1933000	the superconductor
1933000	1935000	in many disorders.
1935000	1937000	We observed
1937000	1939000	a two-level system behavior
1939000	1941000	at low temperature.
1941000	1943000	At high temperature,
1943000	1945000	we observed
1945000	1947000	a semi-regenerated
1947000	1949000	quasi-particle.
1949000	1951000	What is the difference between
1951000	1953000	these two things?
1953000	1955000	At low temperature,
1955000	1957000	it is a two-level system.
1957000	1959000	A two-level system
1959000	1961000	usually has
1961000	1963000	some non-saturated
1963000	1965000	or non-reactive
1965000	1967000	oxides or dielectrics
1967000	1969000	in the dielectric
1969000	1971000	when the film
1971000	1973000	is growing.
1973000	1975000	These dielectrics
1975000	1977000	will produce
1977000	1979000	some local
1979000	1981000	electrical dipoles.
1981000	1983000	They will have
1983000	1985000	some oscillation
1985000	1987000	with the
1987000	1989000	EM field
1989000	1991000	in our
1991000	1993000	micro-resonator.
1993000	1995000	This will
1995000	1997000	cause an additional
1997000	1999000	loss.
1999000	2001000	This loss
2001000	2003000	will not change
2003000	2005000	with the temperature.
2005000	2007000	At higher temperature,
2007000	2009000	a quasi-particle
2009000	2011000	will be produced.
2011000	2013000	It is similar to
2013000	2015000	when you get closer to Tc,
2015000	2017000	your couple pair
2017000	2019000	will start to break
2019000	2021000	due to temperature.
2021000	2023000	These normal electrons
2023000	2025000	will reduce
2025000	2027000	your quality factor.
2027000	2029000	These normal electrons
2029000	2031000	will produce
2031000	2033000	some excitation
2033000	2035000	from exponential
2035000	2037000	1 over kT
2037000	2039000	to produce a model.
2039000	2041000	This is the so-called
2041000	2043000	Martin-Spartan theory.
2043000	2045000	So basically,
2045000	2047000	our work here is to verify...
2047000	2049000	I have a question.
2049000	2051000	Do you have exactly
2051000	2053000	the same geometry
2053000	2055000	as ordinary aluminum?
2055000	2057000	We are curious
2057000	2059000	about the difference between
2059000	2061000	granular aluminum
2061000	2063000	and ordinary aluminum.
2063000	2065000	We didn't really
2065000	2067000	calibrate the two-level system.
2067000	2069000	Pure aluminum
2069000	2071000	has a
2071000	2073000	very low
2073000	2075000	kinetic doctrine,
2075000	2077000	so
2077000	2079000	we didn't really
2079000	2081000	calibrate
2081000	2083000	the two-level system.
2083000	2085000	Oh, okay.
2085000	2087000	I understand.
2087000	2089000	I think
2089000	2091000	another
2091000	2093000	crude comparison
2093000	2095000	is that if you
2095000	2097000	make exactly the same feature
2097000	2099000	but ordinary aluminum,
2099000	2101000	what is the difference
2101000	2103000	between your QI?
2103000	2105000	If your QI is
2105000	2107000	TLS lost at low temperature,
2107000	2109000	you can compare, right?
2109000	2111000	I think
2111000	2113000	the two-level system
2113000	2115000	I just mentioned
2115000	2117000	is highly related to your QI.
2117000	2119000	For example, if we make
2119000	2121000	granular aluminum,
2121000	2123000	I also suspect that our aluminum...
2123000	2125000	Because granular aluminum
2125000	2127000	is built-in oxide.
2127000	2129000	So will the material itself
2129000	2131000	have some two-level system loss
2131000	2133000	from the structure of the material itself?
2133000	2135000	This is also possible.
2135000	2137000	Yes, I'm actually
2137000	2139000	worried about this.
2139000	2141000	Okay, I understand.
2141000	2143000	Okay, so...
2143000	2145000	The details
2145000	2147000	need to be more
2147000	2149000	detailed.
2149000	2151000	It does require more detailed
2151000	2153000	analysis of the structure.
2153000	2155000	Because the two-level system is
2155000	2157000	the source of
2157000	2159000	the NOES of OneOF.
2159000	2161000	So
2161000	2163000	we need to spend more time on it.
2163000	2165000	For example, for surface cleaning,
2165000	2167000	we need to be more careful
2167000	2169000	and more detailed.
2169000	2171000	Right.
2171000	2173000	Okay, thank you.
2173000	2175000	Thank you.
2175000	2177000	And...
2177000	2179000	Right, so basically
2179000	2181000	what I'm talking about here is
2181000	2183000	we are fitting two parameters,
2183000	2185000	which are the parameters in practice,
2185000	2187000	the results obtained in practice,
2187000	2189000	which are my frequency shift and my quality factor.
2189000	2191000	Then I can get
2191000	2193000	a very good match,
2193000	2195000	that is, the contribution of my loss
2195000	2197000	is basically
2197000	2199000	temperature-independent.
2199000	2201000	At low temperature,
2201000	2203000	it is temperature-independent
2203000	2205000	two-level system loss
2205000	2207000	that dominates.
2207000	2209000	At high temperature,
2209000	2211000	more than 250 mC,
2211000	2213000	I can see the sum of
2213000	2215000	the sum of the generated
2215000	2217000	quasiparticle that dominates.
2217000	2219000	Yes, this is a simple summary.
2219000	2221000	Okay.
2221000	2223000	Next is our
2223000	2225000	performance QP.
2227000	2229000	This time we use
2229000	2231000	Junction to do super-inductor.
2231000	2233000	It is closer to
2233000	2235000	what Meru and Quarren did.
2235000	2237000	Then,
2237000	2239000	as we just mentioned,
2239000	2241000	using quantum mechanics to do super-inductor
2241000	2243000	to build this structure
2243000	2245000	is still an ongoing process.
2245000	2247000	In this circuit,
2247000	2249000	how can this circuit
2249000	2251000	be mapped to this place?
2251000	2253000	Basically, you turn this 90 degrees,
2253000	2255000	then these two junctions,
2255000	2257000	these two red cross,
2257000	2259000	then this super-inductor,
2259000	2261000	half here,
2261000	2263000	the other half here,
2263000	2265000	then the last two sides
2265000	2267000	are connected to this.
2267000	2269000	This thing turns 90 degrees counterclockwise,
2269000	2271000	then it will be mapped to this graph.
2271000	2273000	Then connect to a radar resonator.
2273000	2275000	This radar resonator is coupled
2275000	2277000	to a microwave line.
2277000	2279000	This is a strip-line structure,
2279000	2281000	not a coplanar waveguide.
2281000	2283000	These are basically
2283000	2285000	how we do this device.
2285000	2287000	Then,
2287000	2289000	the device parameters,
2289000	2291000	what we do on the structure
2291000	2293000	is that we
2293000	2295000	use
2295000	2297000	our super-inductor,
2297000	2299000	we can't do much in this device.
2299000	2301000	Basically,
2301000	2303000	I remember
2303000	2305000	this device is
2305000	2307000	less than a microherry.
2307000	2309000	This device
2311000	2313000	is less than
2313000	2315000	a microherry.
2315000	2317000	It's not an ideal device.
2317000	2319000	When our super-inductor
2319000	2321000	is not big enough,
2321000	2323000	we still have
2323000	2325000	T1 protection,
2325000	2327000	but our defacient protection
2327000	2329000	is not too big.
2329000	2331000	Basically,
2331000	2333000	our T2 data
2333000	2335000	is about
2335000	2337000	1 microsecond.
2337000	2339000	T1 can be
2339000	2341000	10 to 100 microseconds.
2343000	2345000	Our device
2345000	2347000	is
2347000	2349000	basically
2349000	2351000	a charge-sensitive device
2351000	2353000	because it has a coplanar island.
2353000	2355000	Then,
2355000	2357000	in this device,
2357000	2359000	we do
2359000	2361000	quasi-particle trap.
2361000	2363000	The concept is basically
2363000	2365000	because we have
2365000	2367000	an island structure,
2367000	2369000	we have three different
2369000	2371000	films,
2371000	2373000	three layers of aluminum.
2373000	2375000	They are all aluminum,
2375000	2377000	but they are made in different processes.
2377000	2379000	These three layers
2379000	2381000	can be separated.
2381000	2383000	These two are the same layer,
2383000	2385000	and this is the other layer.
2385000	2387000	We can adjust the thickness
2387000	2389000	to make the aluminum in the middle
2389000	2391000	thinner.
2391000	2393000	The aluminum will have a bigger
2393000	2395000	Tc, a bigger bandgap.
2395000	2397000	This kind of structure
2397000	2399000	can make
2399000	2401000	the middle
2401000	2403000	island
2403000	2405000	have a bigger bandgap.
2405000	2407000	So, the quasi-particle
2407000	2409000	is not easy to come up,
2409000	2411000	and suppress
2411000	2413000	the quasi-particle poisoning.
2413000	2415000	It is simply controlled
2415000	2417000	by the thickness of the film.
2417000	2419000	Then,
2419000	2421000	we observed that
2421000	2423000	in 8 hours,
2423000	2425000	we only saw a few times
2425000	2427000	the quasi-particle
2427000	2429000	jump.
2429000	2431000	The number of times is relatively small,
2431000	2433000	and each measurement
2433000	2435000	ends very quickly.
2435000	2437000	If it is a time domain,
2437000	2439000	it ends very quickly,
2439000	2441000	so we rarely
2441000	2443000	encounter it.
2443000	2445000	Basically, we measure the data
2445000	2447000	and
2447000	2449000	this is a relatively impressive
2449000	2451000	place.
2451000	2453000	If you don't do
2453000	2455000	quasi-particle trap,
2455000	2457000	the frequency of the jump
2457000	2459000	is about 10 ms.
2459000	2461000	In our system,
2461000	2463000	the shortest
2463000	2465000	is also about
2465000	2467000	10 ms.
2467000	2469000	This
2469000	2471000	is our
2471000	2473000	frequency domain
2473000	2475000	of spectroscopy.
2475000	2477000	These are
2477000	2479000	X01 transition,
2479000	2481000	which is
2481000	2483000	the cubic spectrum.
2483000	2485000	The blue data
2485000	2487000	is the
2487000	2489000	unprotected state,
2489000	2491000	which is the
2493000	2495000	anti-level crossing.
2495000	2497000	The orange data
2497000	2499000	is the
2499000	2501000	island bias 1E,
2501000	2503000	which is 0.5.
2503000	2505000	We see
2505000	2507000	degeneracy,
2507000	2509000	which is the Arunacheshire effect.
2509000	2511000	When we enable
2511000	2513000	the system's protected state,
2513000	2515000	we see
2515000	2517000	degenerated ground state.
2517000	2519000	When
2519000	2521000	we enter
2521000	2523000	0E,
2523000	2525000	we enter the unprotected state,
2525000	2527000	and we can do the reading.
2527000	2529000	On the other hand,
2529000	2531000	the linear fit
2531000	2533000	is basically
2533000	2535000	the super-inductor.
2535000	2537000	We can get
2537000	2539000	the super-inductor
2539000	2541000	inductance.
2541000	2543000	Sorry, the inductance is
2543000	2545000	0.1 mH,
2545000	2547000	not 1 mH.
2547000	2549000	On the other hand,
2549000	2551000	we observe
2551000	2553000	the
2553000	2555000	self-resonance
2555000	2557000	frequency, which is
2557000	2559000	0.1 mH.
2559000	2561000	From this frequency,
2561000	2563000	we can get the junction-based super-inductor.
2563000	2565000	Its impedance is
2565000	2567000	about 4 kΩ.
2569000	2571000	The proof-of-concept
2571000	2573000	shown here
2573000	2575000	is how to
2575000	2577000	enable
2577000	2579000	the protected state
2579000	2581000	and
2581000	2583000	compare
2583000	2585000	the protected and unprotected state.
2585000	2587000	This is the
2587000	2589000	microwave protocol.
2589000	2591000	The y-axis
2591000	2593000	is the charge,
2593000	2595000	which means
2595000	2597000	I turn on
2597000	2599000	the protection
2599000	2601000	on i.e. bias 1E,
2601000	2603000	and turn off the protection
2603000	2605000	on i.e. remove the gate.
2607000	2609000	What we do
2609000	2611000	is to let the system
2611000	2613000	be in unprotected state,
2613000	2615000	and then we
2615000	2617000	write the system into 1.
2617000	2619000	Then we turn on the protection.
2619000	2621000	This is a 30-minute
2621000	2623000	pause to
2623000	2625000	turn on the protection.
2625000	2627000	The duration is Δt.
2627000	2629000	After Δt,
2629000	2631000	I turn off the pause
2631000	2633000	and read the system
2633000	2635000	to see whether it is in 0 or 1.
2635000	2637000	This is the relaxation of the system.
2637000	2639000	The delta is here.
2639000	2641000	If there is no
2641000	2643000	gate,
2643000	2645000	the T1 feed
2645000	2647000	is about 12 microseconds.
2647000	2649000	When I turn on
2649000	2651000	the protection,
2651000	2653000	the T1 can reach
2653000	2655000	100 microseconds,
2655000	2657000	which is 10 times
2657000	2659000	the improvement.
2659000	2661000	However,
2661000	2663000	the T1 of this device
2663000	2665000	is still quite bad,
2665000	2667000	which is only 10 microseconds.
2667000	2669000	We can use
2669000	2671000	ArrayCatcherEffect
2671000	2673000	to demonstrate
2673000	2675000	that ArrayCatcherEffect
2675000	2677000	can help us achieve
2677000	2679000	a protected effect.
2679000	2681000	Basically,
2681000	2683000	we verify
2683000	2685000	this graph
2685000	2687000	at different flux-biasing points.
2687000	2689000	We can see
2689000	2691000	about 10 times
2691000	2693000	the improvement.
2693000	2695000	The location of 0.3
2695000	2697000	is PhiExternal
2697000	2699000	and 6 PiExternal
2699000	2701000	are matched to
2701000	2703000	the read-out resonator.
2703000	2705000	Therefore, we get
2705000	2707000	0.3
2707000	2709000	or 6 GHz.
2709000	2711000	These 6 GHz
2711000	2713000	are the
2713000	2715000	read-out resonator
2715000	2717000	frequencies.
2723000	2725000	This is the
2725000	2727000	conclusion.
2727000	2729000	We realize
2729000	2731000	a prototype circuit.
2731000	2733000	This circuit
2733000	2735000	can have
2735000	2737000	a protective
2737000	2739000	mechanism.
2739000	2741000	We can
2741000	2743000	enjoy
2743000	2745000	a short gate-time
2745000	2747000	while
2747000	2749000	enjoying a higher
2749000	2751000	improvement of T1.
2751000	2753000	This is
2753000	2755000	the main topic of today.
2755000	2757000	Thank you to all my collaborators.
2757000	2759000	Thank you for your
2759000	2761000	participation.
2761000	2763000	I'm ready to take questions.
2763000	2765000	Before
2765000	2767000	the Q&A,
2767000	2769000	let's give a round of
2769000	2771000	applause to Wen-Cheng
2771000	2773000	for his wonderful speech.
2773000	2775000	Of course,
2775000	2777000	if you have any questions,
2777000	2779000	you can
2779000	2781000	open the microphone to ask.
2783000	2785000	Is there
2785000	2787000	any question?
2787000	2789000	Actually, I have a question.
2789000	2791000	Let me ask a question first.
2791000	2793000	Sorry.
2793000	2795000	OK.
2795000	2797000	Can I
2797000	2799000	ask you a question?
2799000	2801000	Sorry.
2801000	2803000	OK.
2803000	2805000	Very nice talk.
2805000	2807000	The result is
2807000	2809000	very exciting.
2809000	2811000	I want to ask
2811000	2813000	about
2813000	2815000	the following
2815000	2817000	work.
2817000	2819000	T1 is
2819000	2821000	102 microseconds
2821000	2823000	under the protective state.
2823000	2825000	I want to ask
2825000	2827000	if you have studied
2827000	2829000	what limiting factor
2829000	2831000	limits it to
2831000	2833000	102 microseconds.
2833000	2835000	Yes.
2835000	2837000	Basically,
2837000	2839000	it is...
2839000	2841000	It is
2841000	2843000	junction symmetry.
2843000	2845000	In short, it is junction symmetry.
2845000	2847000	If the two junctions
2847000	2849000	are not symmetric,
2849000	2851000	it will affect
2851000	2853000	the original T1.
2853000	2855000	Even unprotected state
2855000	2857000	will affect T1.
2857000	2859000	Yes.
2859000	2861000	I don't think
2861000	2863000	I put it here.
2863000	2865000	Basically,
2865000	2867000	if these two junctions
2867000	2869000	have either oxidation
2869000	2871000	or size asymmetry,
2871000	2873000	it will
2873000	2875000	limit T1.
2879000	2881000	Is it different from
2881000	2883000	dielectric loss
2883000	2885000	limitation?
2885000	2887000	Is it?
2887000	2889000	It is not caused by
2889000	2891000	two-level system.
2891000	2893000	At least,
2893000	2895000	in modeling,
2895000	2897000	they know better.
2897000	2899000	According to their feedback,
2899000	2901000	in modeling,
2901000	2903000	asymmetry will have a big impact.
2903000	2905000	Asymmetry can be
2905000	2907000	from our...
2907000	2909000	We can look at it
2909000	2911000	with a squeegee.
2911000	2913000	We can
2913000	2915000	look at
2915000	2917000	asymmetry
2917000	2919000	at the lowest point
2919000	2921000	of the field.
2921000	2923000	Our equipment is bad.
2923000	2925000	We make
2925000	2927000	asymmetry,
2927000	2929000	put it in modeling,
2929000	2931000	and push it out.
2931000	2933000	It tells us
2933000	2935000	our equipment is bad.
2935000	2937000	Or
2937000	2939000	maybe not.
2939000	2941000	The junction symmetry
2941000	2943000	is more particular.
2943000	2945000	We must use two junctions.
2945000	2947000	The asymmetry of these two junctions
2947000	2949000	is quite critical.
2949000	2951000	I have a question.
2951000	2953000	What is your
2953000	2955000	asymmetry?
2955000	2957000	For example,
2957000	2959000	your asymmetry
2959000	2961000	can be parameterized.
2961000	2963000	For example,
2963000	2965000	in Squid,
2965000	2967000	there is a defect.
2967000	2969000	How much
2969000	2971000	difference
2971000	2973000	is there?
2973000	2975000	Ideally,
2975000	2977000	what is the difference?
2977000	2979000	We use
2979000	2981000	gigahertz.
2981000	2983000	0.6 gigahertz.
2987000	2989000	So your
2989000	2991000	delta
2991000	2993000	is about
2993000	2995000	0.4 gigahertz.
2995000	2997000	I see.
2997000	2999000	There is no difference.
2999000	3001000	Asymmetry
3001000	3003000	is a must
3003000	3005000	for junction.
3005000	3007000	Our
3007000	3009000	situation is
3009000	3011000	that
3011000	3013000	our device
3013000	3015000	must have these two junctions.
3015000	3017000	You can't just make one.
3017000	3019000	You have to have both.
3019000	3021000	If you make one,
3021000	3023000	there will be such a problem.
3023000	3025000	The device
3025000	3027000	is particular about delta.
3027000	3029000	It takes time to tune.
3031000	3033000	If you don't mind,
3033000	3035000	I have a second question.
3035000	3037000	Why your
3037000	3039000	super inductor
3039000	3041000	junction
3041000	3043000	is
3043000	3045000	a two-angle junction?
3045000	3047000	It looks like
3047000	3049000	a rotating-angle junction,
3049000	3051000	not a
3051000	3053000	stolen-bridge junction.
3053000	3055000	Unlike what we did
3055000	3057000	in Maryland.
3057000	3059000	Our boss doesn't like
3059000	3061000	stolen-bridge junction.
3061000	3063000	He thinks
3063000	3065000	our junction
3065000	3067000	won't be broken.
3067000	3069000	So I want to fix it,
3069000	3071000	but my boss says it's too slow.
3073000	3075000	Is your
3075000	3077000	blow-dry
3077000	3079000	like a trick?
3079000	3081000	What?
3081000	3083000	Do you have a special trick
3083000	3085000	when you blow-dry?
3085000	3087000	I remember that
3087000	3089000	top-mask
3089000	3091000	was a PMMA
3091000	3093000	last year.
3093000	3095000	It collapsed when I blow-dry it.
3095000	3097000	I couldn't finish it in 4 or 5 years.
3097000	3099000	My boss told me not to do it again.
3099000	3101000	So I want to ask you.
3105000	3107000	According to
3107000	3109000	normal
3109000	3111000	fab,
3111000	3113000	our yield
3113000	3115000	is quite high.
3115000	3117000	As long as
3117000	3119000	the first step is OK,
3119000	3121000	and the next step is OK,
3121000	3123000	it's usually
3123000	3125000	not a problem.
3125000	3127000	It's usually not a problem.
3127000	3129000	No, we just can't do it.
3129000	3131000	I've been doing it for
3131000	3133000	a week, and my boss said
3133000	3135000	there's nothing special
3135000	3137000	to fix.
3137000	3139000	Nothing special.
3141000	3143000	OK.
3143000	3145000	I see.
3145000	3147000	I'll let others
3147000	3149000	ask questions.
3149000	3151000	Thank you.
3153000	3155000	I have a question.
3155000	3157000	Can you go back to
3157000	3159000	TC?
3159000	3161000	TC and
3161000	3163000	granularized.
3165000	3167000	My question is
3167000	3169000	for different
3169000	3171000	samples,
3171000	3173000	do you know
3173000	3175000	the delta
3175000	3177000	bandgap?
3177000	3179000	Is it almost
3179000	3181000	the same?
3181000	3183000	Or not?
3183000	3185000	I didn't test it.
3187000	3189000	But you feed
3189000	3191000	Matisse-Bardini
3191000	3193000	and you get the value.
3193000	3195000	Oh, no, sorry.
3195000	3197000	This TC is independent.
3197000	3199000	I just use it
3199000	3201000	to test TC.
3201000	3203000	Oh, I see.
3203000	3205000	So each data is
3205000	3207000	transported by TC.
3207000	3209000	And there's no microwave.
3209000	3211000	Matisse-Bardini uses microwave.
3211000	3213000	Right.
3213000	3215000	So we don't...
3215000	3217000	Suppose
3217000	3219000	there should be
3219000	3221000	a resonator chip.
3221000	3223000	Suppose
3223000	3225000	if it's 100% Matisse-Bardini,
3225000	3227000	it should be exactly the same.
3227000	3229000	But we're worried
3229000	3231000	because we don't know
3231000	3233000	how much of it is not Matisse-Bardini.
3233000	3235000	We're curious.
3235000	3237000	Yeah, that's
3237000	3239000	a very good point.
3239000	3241000	But in that case,
3241000	3243000	if it's
3243000	3245000	what you want to do,
3245000	3247000	you don't want it to be Matisse-Bardini.
3247000	3249000	You want the
3249000	3251000	alpha factor to be high.
3251000	3253000	You want it to
3253000	3255000	deviate from Matisse-Bardini.
3255000	3257000	Not necessarily.
3257000	3259000	But I hope
3259000	3261000	if it really comes from
3261000	3263000	the energy deposit,
3263000	3265000	it can still break the pair.
3265000	3267000	Then I can test the documenter.
3267000	3269000	Otherwise, it reacts a lot
3269000	3271000	but it's useless
3271000	3273000	if it doesn't interact with the particle.
3273000	3275000	Interesting.
3275000	3277000	OK.
3279000	3281000	My understanding is
3281000	3283000	if it follows BCS,
3283000	3285000	it's Matisse-Bardini.
3285000	3287000	We haven't
3287000	3289000	thought about it.
3289000	3291000	At least the first part,
3291000	3293000	the alpha factor is good.
3293000	3295000	We've demonstrated this part.
3295000	3297000	As you can see,
3297000	3299000	we want to test it because of this.
3299000	3301000	But we're worried
3301000	3303000	if it doesn't interact
3303000	3305000	with the physical particle
3305000	3307000	in a normal response,
3307000	3309000	it becomes a very powerful
3309000	3311000	but it only reacts with RF.
3311000	3313000	It's useless.
3315000	3317000	OK.
3317000	3319000	Because what I did before
3319000	3321000	is HKID.
3321000	3323000	The pair I read before
3323000	3325000	is more HKID.
3325000	3327000	I haven't thought about it.
3327000	3329000	OK.
3329000	3331000	OK.
3331000	3333000	OK.
3333000	3335000	As I said last time,
3335000	3337000	in low resistivity,
3337000	3339000	it usually follows
3339000	3341000	strictly
3341000	3343000	Matisse-Bardini.
3343000	3345000	If you push it
3345000	3347000	to close to 800
3347000	3349000	or 1000
3349000	3351000	Michael-Henry per square,
3351000	3353000	sorry,
3353000	3355000	you'll get
3355000	3357000	a nonlinear phenomenon.
3357000	3359000	It makes sense.
3359000	3361000	It's in line with the prediction.
3361000	3363000	It's not Matisse-Bardini.
3363000	3365000	Yes.
3365000	3367000	OK.
3367000	3369000	This is my question.
3369000	3371000	Do you have any other questions?
3371000	3373000	If you don't have any questions,
3373000	3375000	please turn on
3375000	3377000	the microphone.
3379000	3381000	OK.
3381000	3383000	Now I...
