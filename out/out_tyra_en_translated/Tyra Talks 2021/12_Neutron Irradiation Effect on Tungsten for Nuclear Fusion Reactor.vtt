00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Terra Talk on November 21, 2020.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
We are honored to have Dr. Tsing Ke, who just became Dr. Yin Chao yesterday, to give a speech.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
The topic of his speech today is Neutron Irradiation Effect on Tom Stanford Nuclear Fusion Reactor.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
If you don't know what ITER is, you can google it.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
It is basically the world's largest nuclear fusion experiment or nuclear fusion reactor.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Yin Chao.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Dr. Yin Chao's main field of research is the field he will talk to us about today,

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
which is material science, especially nuclear materials, nuclear fusion, tungsten, and neutron irradiation.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
In the past, Dr. Yin Chao obtained a master's degree from the Department of Materials at Taipei University of Science and Technology.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
After obtaining a master's degree in the same place, he went to UC Berkeley's Department of Nuclear Engineering and obtained a master's degree.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
After that, he is now at the Belize Nuclear Research Center,

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
and also obtained a doctor's degree from the Department of Materials at Ruwen University.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Dr. Yin Chao's research focuses on nuclear power plants floating on the ocean,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
and the nuclear fusion reactor material.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Dr. Yin Chao for his speech.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:44.000 --> 01:53.000
As I said earlier, my speech will focus on the neutron irradiation effect of nukes.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
The nukes will be applied to the nuclear fusion reactor.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Let me introduce my unit first.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Our unit is called SCK-CEN.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
SCK and CEN have the same meaning.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
SCK stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
and CEN stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Belize is a bilingual country.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Our unit is located in Mol, which is very close to the Netherlands.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Our unit has three reactors,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
BR1, BR2, and BR3, which are the Belgian reactors 1, 2, and 3.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
BR1 is the earliest reactor.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
BR2 is the most recent reactor.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
BR2 is the most recent reactor.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
BR2 was originally designed for material testing.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
some nuclear accidents occurred,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
like Chernobyl and Fukushima.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Since the nuclear industry has fallen,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
there are not as many experiments to do the material test.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Since the nuclear industry has fallen, there are not as many experiments to do the material test.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Some part of it has been converted into medical isotopes

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
and half-body doping.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
But they decided to dismantle it due to some problems.

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
Now it is a place to study how to retire the nuclear power plant.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Our company built a Mira.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It is a new reactor,

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
which is controlled by a accelerator.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
It is a reactor and accelerator.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
If you want to know more about our company,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
you can come here.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
If you want to know more about our company,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
you can come here.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Let's continue.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
My speech will be divided into five sections.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
First, I will introduce what nuclear fusion is,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
what kind of reactor it is,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
why we use it,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
what materials I tested,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
how I tested it,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
and the radiation testing.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Next, I will introduce the development method.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I will introduce three methods of development,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
three methods of improvement,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
to measure radiation.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Next, I will tell you about

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
the result before and after radiation.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
I will tell you about the result before and after radiation.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
First, introduction.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
As you know,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
2 million years ago,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
humans discovered fire.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
The symbol of the discovery of fire

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
is that humans began to control chemical energy.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
If we did not control chemical energy,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
there would be no industrial revolution,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
and there would be no modern society.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
In the middle of the 20th century,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
another important thing happened.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
We discovered nuclear energy,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
and we learned how to use the energy of nuclear fission

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
to generate electricity.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
We have been using it for more than half a century.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Among them, nuclear fusion is the holy grail of nuclear energy.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
If we can control nuclear fusion,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
we can get relatively clean energy,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and it is also sustainable.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
It can be used for thousands of years.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Because the raw materials can be directly planted in the sea,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
or mining lithium.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So basically,

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
its fuel is non-negotiable.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
In addition,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
we can even use this energy to expand the universe

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
and explore in another galaxy.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because as we know,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
if you leave the solar system

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
or reach the solar system's borders,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
you cannot use solar energy

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
because you are too far from the sun

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
or too far from any core.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So the efficiency of using solar energy is too low.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
If you use chemical energy,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
the chemical rocket will not reach that far.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Even if it reaches that far,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
if you use a fuel cell,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
it will soon run out of fuel.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
So the only way is to use nuclear energy.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
What is nuclear fusion?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Nuclear fusion is an example of

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
the reaction of copper and iron.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
There are two lighter atoms,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
copper and iron,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
deuterium and trillium.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
They combine to form a heavier atom,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
helium,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
and release a neutron.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Then you can...

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Sorry.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You can see from the picture on the right

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
that the energy released by fusion

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
is much higher than that of fission.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
This is why we say

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
that nuclear fusion is the Holy Grail of nuclear energy.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Because the energy obtained

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
from the same amount of fuel

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
is about four or five times that of fusion.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Scientists are now studying

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
how to control nuclear fusion.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
There are several types of reactors

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
that have been proposed.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
If you want to make a general classification,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
you can classify them into

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
magnetic fields and inertial fields.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The most famous of the magnetic fields

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
is the Tokens.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
It is also called ITER.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
ITER means the way in Latin.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
The other one is the Stellarator.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
The Stellarator is a centrifuge.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
The most famous centrifuge is

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
the Winchester 7X in Germany.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
The most famous inertial confinement

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
is the National Ignition Facility in the United States.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The National Ignition Facility

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
in the United States

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
has a slightly different way

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
of generating nuclear fusion.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
The way it is confined

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
is the same as its name.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
It uses a magnetic field

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
to confine the electric field.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
The electric field is heated to

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
more than 1.5 billion degrees

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
to generate nuclear fusion.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
The inertial confinement

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
uses a lot of lasers.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
It hits the fuel capsule

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
to generate high-temperature high-pressure

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and small nuclear explosions.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
It is a controllable light explosion.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Among all the reactors

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I just mentioned,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
the one that is the closest

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
to commercialization

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
is Tokamak.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
The most famous one is ITER.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
This is its diagram.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
As I mentioned,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
ITER uses magnetic field

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
and the fuel is

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
a blade and a wire.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
The design of the reactor

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
is postmode,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
which is a kind of

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
pulse-mode reactor.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
When the nuclear reaction occurs,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
it releases high-energy neutrons

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and high-temperature electrons

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
along the magnetic field.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The high-temperature electrons

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
are brought along the magnetic field

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
to the diverter,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
which is the red part.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
The diverter receives

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
high neutrons and high-temperature electrons

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
and is a pulse-mode reactor.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
This is a very challenging

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
and rigorous challenge.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
What is a diverter?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
You can see the structure of a diverter.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
The diverter cassette

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
is composed of many plasma-facing units.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
You can see the plasma-facing units

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
are arranged one by one.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Each unit is composed of

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
several tungsten monoblocks

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
and is connected by a tube.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
The tube is used to

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
let the coolant flow through.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You can see that

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
in a steady-state operation,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
10 MW per m2

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
is deposited

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
on the surface of the material.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
You can see that

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
the surface temperature

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
rises to 1,200 °C.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
The temperature drop

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
is only 8 mm.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
This is a very serious impact

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
on the material.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
In addition,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
it is a pulse-mode reactor,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
which produces fatigue.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
The temperature is very high.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
It is like the temperature

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
produced by friction

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
when a spaceship enters the atmosphere.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
This is a very extreme condition.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Why do we choose to use lead?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Because lead has the highest concentration

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
in all metals.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
In addition, it is basically pure metal

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
and has a relatively small

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
concentration after oxidation.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
In addition,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
it is not easy to

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
keep the fuel in it.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
However,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
it is very brittle

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
at low temperature.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
It is a bit like ceramic.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Why does this happen?

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
As you may have heard,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
iron becomes brittle

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
at low temperature.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
It does not become brittle

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
when you hit it.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
This is the case

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
in BCC,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
which is also a metal of

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
high temperature.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
In addition,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
the temperature may rise to 2,000 degrees

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
when there is a special situation.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
In October,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
it is like a solar flare.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It suddenly releases a lot of heat

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
and the surface becomes

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
more than 2,000 degrees.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
This will cause the mechanical properties

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
of the material to deteriorate.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
In addition,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
there will be some

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
transmutation elements

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
due to lead oxidation.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
This is why

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
different materials

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
are developed.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Urethane and

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
high deformation

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
materials

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
have a good feature.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Their DBTT,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
which I just talked about,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
will become brittle

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
when it is transformed.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
The material that was transformed

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
will become as brittle as ceramic.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
The temperature of transformation

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
is DBTT.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
This is called transformation temperature.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
In addition,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
they also propose

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Particle Reinforced Tonsils,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
which contains some

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
oxidized or oxidized materials

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
to stabilize the grain boundary.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
The heat stability

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
will be higher.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
DBTT is the same.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
It will contain some

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
fake elements

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
to stabilize the boundary.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
It can suppress the phenomenon

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
of mechanical growth and tightness.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I have a question.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
We also do a lot of

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
neutron scattering experiments.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
We do particle physics,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
so we care about

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
the energy of each neutron

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
more than the total energy

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
multiplied by its flux.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Do you care about the energy of neutrons

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
more than the total energy

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
multiplied by its flux?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
We care about both.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
I will talk about it later.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
What I am talking about now

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
is the manufacturing process.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
The material is brittle

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
when it is at room temperature.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
It is difficult to process.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
So we use cross-sectional molding

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
and spot plasma sintering

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
to reduce the number of processing.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So the final product will be produced.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
They propose so many

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
different materials

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
but they never do the test.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
When designing DBTT,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
you need to consider

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
the strict conditions

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
for the machine to perform well.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
So they need this kind of data.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
So my PhD thesis is

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
to assess these

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
high-temperature neutron elation effects.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
The conditions are

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
the highest temperature is 1200°C

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
based on the operation of the ETH diverter.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
The ETH diverter's

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
end-of-life

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
which is the highest cumulative mass

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
is less than 1 dPa

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
which is displacement per atom.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Displacement per atom

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
is a method to calculate

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
how many times the atom is moved.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
The higher the number,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
the higher the displacement per atom.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Hello, can I ask a question?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Yes, you can.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm working in nuclear engineering

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
at Utah University.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
So I've touched a lot of these.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
So you said the temperature is very high

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
and it has displacement per atom.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
But if the temperature is high

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
and you heat it up,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
it will return to its original state.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Will it be able to repair itself?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
It will repair itself.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But what I'm trying to say is

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
the calculation

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
because the displacement per atom

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
is not really displacement per atom.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
It's interstitial or vacancy.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So the purpose of the cumulative dPa

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
is to calculate the fluence.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Because the neutron source

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
and the iron source

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
and the electron source

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
all have dPa.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
They all have their own fluence.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
So the purpose of the dPa

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
is to have a match

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
between the damage and the fluence.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
It's just a comparison.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
It's not that the density of the voice

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
will be that high or that low.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Because at different temperatures,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
like what you said,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
it will have a different effect.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Thank you.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
We have a total of 12 materials

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
that are being studied.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
One of them is a multi-crystalline material

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
and the other is a single-crystalline material.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
If the multi-crystalline material

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
is divided by the composition of the material,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
it will be divided into a pure material

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
or a particle-reinforced material

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
or a non-crystalline material.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
For the pure material,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
it's either purchased

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
or provided by different research units.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
So IGP is made in Australia.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
ATW is made in China.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
IGA is made in Japan.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Particle-reinforced tungsten

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
contains some things like

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
zirconium carbide or titanium carbide

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
and ethane oxide.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
For the tungsten alloys,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
as I mentioned earlier,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
it contains DOPE and

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
ferric alloy.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
KR is ferric alloy.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
If you divide it by the composition,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
you can also divide it into three categories.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
There are rolled and forged materials.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
The advanced process is

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
spark plasma sintering.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
The last one, recrystallized tungsten,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
is a reference group.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
It's to increase the structure of the fiber

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
and let us know more about

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
the impact of the corrosion.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
If we divide it by the volume,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
we can divide it into two types.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
The first one is elongated grains.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
You can see that

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
only IGP is carrier-like grains

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
because it's double forged.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
It's broken on both sides.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
So it's elongated and

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
looks like fiber.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
The other materials are rolled,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
so it's flat and pancake-like.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
It's like a pancake.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
The remaining four materials,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
advanced process and recrystallized tungsten,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
are all equal axis grains.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
It's not particularly long.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
The four pieces I use are all

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
metatrized samples.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
You can see that it's only 12 mm in size.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
It's about a dollar in size.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
The elongated grains,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
the forged and rolled tungsten,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
are metatrized,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
so their mechanical properties are ideal.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
They have different properties in different directions.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So we took two directions to analyze.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
How do we define the direction?

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
It's determined by the position

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
of the material when it breaks

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
If the broken surface is perpendicular

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
to the elongated grain,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
we say it's an L-sample or LT-sample.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
If it's parallel to the elongated grain,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
we say it's a TL-sample.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
There are four tests

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
applied in our experiment.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
The first one is fractured tungsten,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
which has a black line in the middle.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
We used EDM to cut it

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
in a power-generating way,

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
and we cut out a small hole.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
This small hole can be used

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
as a crack,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
and it can be used

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
as a crack hole,

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
and it can be used

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
as a crack hole,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
so we can test

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
the resistance of the crack hole expansion.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
In the end,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
we cut out the fragment.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Tensile test is the most common

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
mechanical property.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
The test is mainly for

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
measuring the force-force curve,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
compressive strength,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
elongation strength,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
and some elongation properties.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
The third one is

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
3-point bending test.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
The 3-point bending test

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
mainly tests the bending nature,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
including bending force and bending hardness.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
In our experiment,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
we tested the 3-point bending test.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
The last one is

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
micro-indentation test.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
This is a very simple test.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I used an indenter

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
to press a crack on the surface of the material

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
to measure its size and hardness.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
If the indent is small,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
the hardness will be high.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
The 3-point bending test

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
is different from the previous ones.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Neutron irradiation is

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
done in Fission Reactor 2.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
As we all know,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
fusion and fission are very different

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
in the neutron spectrum.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Fission has a very high

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
thermoneutron flux.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
In order to make the spectrum

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
as close to fusion as possible,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
we need to block

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
the thermoneutrons.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
We use a steel capsule

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
to cover the sample

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
to block the thermoneutrons.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
In addition,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
we put the capsule

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
in the middle of the fuel channel

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
to reduce the thermoneutrons.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
In addition,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
we need to perform

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
high-temperature experiments.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
The high-temperature experiment

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
is because the sample

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
will be gamma-heated in the fusion reactor.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
The temperature of the sample

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
will be higher

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
if we reduce the thermoneutrons

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
and lower the temperature

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
if we increase the thermoneutrons.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
We use a spacer pin

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
to control the distance

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
between the sample and the capsule.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
The shorter the distance,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
the lower the temperature.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Here are the three tests

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
that I developed and improved.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
The first one is

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
the Fracture Time Detect

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
and the Sturman Bending Test.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
I combined the two tests

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
because most of the standard tests

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
are aimed at steel.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
We all know that

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
steel is a high-temperature material.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
However,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
we can't test the material

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
directly with the ANC standard.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
We can't test the material

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
directly with the ANC standard.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
This is an improvement.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
You can see that

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
the Fracture Time Detect

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
and the Sturman Bending Test

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
increase with the temperature.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
When I combine the two curves,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
you can see that

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
they are basically the same.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
I can define a DVTT

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
when the Fracture Strength

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
is equal to 5%,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
the Fracture Toughness

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
is equal to 5%

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
and the Fracture Strength

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
is equal to 5%.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
This can be used

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
as a DVTT definition.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
However,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
you will find that

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
the DVTT can't be used

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
as a DVTT definition.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
We can use the ANC test

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
to support or even replace

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
the Fracture Time Detect.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
You can see that

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
the geometry of the sample

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
and the test setup are simpler.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
It can reduce a lot of costs.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
I have a question.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
I can understand that

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
but do you have a goal?

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
For example,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
what kind of spec do you want to achieve?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
What do you mean?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
For example,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
what kind of data do you want to improve?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Do you have a goal

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
to meet the future needs?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
Our goal is

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
to reduce the number of tests

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
and to reduce the number of samples.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
When we do this kind of test,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
the space of the reactor is limited.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
The number of samples

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
is also limited.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Any experiment requires

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
high-intensity protection

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
and a lot of regulations.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
For example,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
a tensile sample

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
costs 5,000 euros.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
So your focus is on

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
developing a way to test.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Yes.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
What kind of value do you want to test?

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
The value I want to test

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
is the same as the standard.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
I can use it to replace the standard.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I see.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
So you don't do any value-changing?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
The value-changing part

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
is done by other institutes.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I mentioned it just now.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I do the final approval.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It takes a lot of time to do the final approval.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
I didn't talk about the time it takes.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
For example,

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
I have to wait a year

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
for the final approval.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
After the final approval,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
you can't do it right away

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
because it's too high-intensity.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
You have to cool it down

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
for half a year or even 10 months.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I don't have half the time

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I can ask you a question.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Your BR2 Reactor.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
I used the Belgian Reactor

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
as a benchmark.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Is this called Venus?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Is BR2 Venus?

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Venus.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
They used to build a reactor

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
for PWR vessel material testing.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
They modified it.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
I don't know if it's called Venus.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
I've never heard of Venus.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Can I ask how much power

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
does your reactor have?

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
1 MW?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I don't remember.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
I think it's 50 MW.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
I have a suggestion.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
You used steel for the capsule, right?

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
You want to block the thermoneutron, right?

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Thermoneutron interaction

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
seems to be better with light material.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
If the temperature of the reactor

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
is not too high,

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
polyethylene seems to be better.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Thermoneutron cross-section

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
is bigger.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
If you use light elements

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
to block the thermoneutron,

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
will it be easier to produce more thermoneutron?

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
Because you reduce the number of neutrons.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
So you basically use boron.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
But boron will affect the reactivity.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Yes, so it will be more complicated.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
They won't let you do that.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Thank you.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
So,

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
based on the conclusion we just made,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
we can come up with a method

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
similar to the ASTM standard

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
to test the temperature of the steel.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
So here,

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
we only need one test temperature.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
So we only need one temperature

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
to do the experiment.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
We use the three-point slope

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
to get the slope of the curve.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Then,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
we need to make two assumptions.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
One is 23 MPa square meter,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
which is the DPA we just defined.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
The other is Kbase,

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
which is the lowest value of the curve.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Why do I use 5 to 10 here?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Because 5 to 10 doesn't affect

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
the curve during the transition period.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
The result is basically the same.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So we can deduce the curve.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
So we can deduce the curve.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
This is the deduced curve.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
This is the experiment value.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
You can see that it is quite consistent.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
So you can see that IGP,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
its elasticity is better than ATW,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
The second test method we developed

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
The second test method we developed

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
is the Interrupted Tensile Test.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Generally, the tensile test is to pull it all the way,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
until it breaks.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
After we get the whole curve,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
we will see the tensile strength.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
But we do it differently.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
We will see the tensile strength

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
when it reaches the tensile strength.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
So how do we measure the tensile strength?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
First, we provide a load.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
You can see the stress goes up.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
The load rate is the slope of the stress.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
The load rate is the slope of the stress.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
we stop the test.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
we stop the test.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
We can stop the test

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
At that point,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
there is no major deformation

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
we stop the test

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
at a place close to the tensile strength.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
At that point,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
there is no major deformation

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
At that point,

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
there is no major deformation

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
so it has no effect on its fiber structure.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
At that point,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
we can see that this is a DBT range.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
we can see that this is a DBT range.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
The advantage is that we only need one test piece.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
The advantage is that we only need one test piece.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
This will save us more time.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
This will save us more time.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
You can see that the HMLR

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
is higher than the upper yaw strength.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
This experiment is very suitable for

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
the materials with the HMLR.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
The materials with the HMLR.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
You can see that the HMLR

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
is a drop in the HMLR point.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
You have to be careful to control it,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
because we don't want it to deform,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
so you have to be careful to control the drop point.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
So you have to be careful to control the drop point.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
The third,

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
the last,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
one that I introduced and we developed

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
a testing method.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
This test method is very small.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
This test method is very small.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
A little test method.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
It is an Indian test related to Danjin.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
As we all know,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Danjin has a mechanical phenomenon.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
In other words, it will have different mechanical reactions

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
in different directions.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
So when it was doing the Indian test,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
there was a similar phenomenon.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.000
So when I pressed an indent,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I moved it to another place,

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
rotated it, and pressed it again.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
You will find that the four pictures on the right

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
are rotated at 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees respectively.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
You will see that their shapes are different.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
When we calculate the hardness,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
the traditional method is called Diagonal.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
So it is its diagonal.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Because its shape is different,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
its diagonal is also different.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Then the diagonal is different,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
the hardness you deduced is also different.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So there is a fluctuation.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
What I use here is the True Project Area.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
It will also be different.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
The whole black part,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
I just use this to calculate.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Then it will also be different.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Why is it different?

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
Because in Danjin,

39:57.000 --> 40:03.000
we can use the Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
to explain.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
The Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law is related to

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
the relationship between the stretching force

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and the cutting force.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
It is related to the slip plane of the material.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
It is related to the sliding system.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.000
So if the relative angle of your sliding system

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
changes,

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
your M value will change.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
If your M value changes,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
your cutting force will also change.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
So when your material is deforming,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
your dislocation glide

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
will also require a different force.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
So the deformation of the indent

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
you just saw will be different.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
So we came up with a small

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
suggestion for future experiments.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Because basically,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
there are a lot of people doing low-quantity

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
photocopying experiments,

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
such as 0.0dPa.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
In this situation,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
the irradiation hardening

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
is usually quite low.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
If you don't take this into account,

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
the anisotropic indentation,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
the hardness,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
will cause some of your trends

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
to be a little weird,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
to be disordered.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
So we came up with this.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Because the indent we used

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
as you can see,

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
is a Victor hardness indenter.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
It has four faces.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
So basically,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
the change it produces

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
is a cycle of 90 degrees.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
So it's a sine function.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
So the way we propose is that

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
you can do an experiment

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
at three different angles.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
This is an indentation experiment.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Then,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
by fitting this sine function,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
you get H0.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
This is a very accurate value.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It's a more uniform value.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
You can use it to compare

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
the material hardening.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
If you don't know

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
your crystallography direction,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
which means you don't know

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
where your energy is coming from,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
we suggest you use 8%

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
to represent your uncertainty.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Because we found that

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
no matter how the radiation temperature changes,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
basically,

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
the amplitude is about 8%.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Here are the unradiated results.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
So this is the general tensile property.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
It's the tensile property.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
As you can see from the right,

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
in the experiment at 400 and 600 degrees,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
you can see that

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
the Zirconium carbide-reinforced tungsten

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
has the highest strength,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
which is the brown line.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
Before that,

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I'd like to introduce

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
what uniform elongation is,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
and what early necking is.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Uniform elongation is

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
the strength between

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
the yield strength and UTS,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
which is the tensile strength

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
between the yield strength

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and the tensile strength.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
This is the uniform elongation.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
If there is no uniform elongation,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
this phenomenon is called early necking.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
At 500 degrees,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
which is 400 degrees,

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
you can see that

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
basically all materials

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
have different levels of uniform elongation,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
except T-orientation,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
which is the material

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in the T-direction,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
and L-orientation.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
When you raise the temperature to more than 500 degrees,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
you will find that

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
those with mechanical processing,

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
such as rolling and forging materials,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
they all become early necking.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
Their uniform elongation disappears.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
However,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
those tungsten with advanced processing

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
still have the phenomenon

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
of uniform elongation.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Because of their uniform elongation,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
their work-hardening capacity is better.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Here we also analyze

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
the relative properties of fracture strength.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
You can see that

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
IGP,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
we use the machine

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
of fracture strength

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
and fracture strength

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
to evaluate their fracture resistance,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
which is their toughness.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Basically,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
when you multiply strength and toughness,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
it is energy.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
So we can know

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
how much energy

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
the material needs

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
to resist the fracture.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
You can see that

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
IGP-L needs the highest energy,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
so its fracture resistance is the highest.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
In addition,

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
we will find that

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
in different directions,

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
the fracture strength of the same material

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
in different directions

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
is different.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
You can see that

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
L's fracture strength

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
is higher than T's.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Although their waist strength

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
and ultimate waist strength

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
are basically the same material,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
but their fracture strength is much worse.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Why is that?

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
Here is a possible explanation.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
Because their fracture strength is different.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
You can see that

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the fracture strength of L's sample

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
on the right is like this.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
So if you crack

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
and propagate,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
the weakest part of the material

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
is the fracture strength.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
So basically,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
your fractures like to have fracture strength.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
When you expand the fracture strength

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
in L's sample,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
it will usually come across

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
the middle of the fracture strength.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Either it deviates

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
or it goes through.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
When it goes through,

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
the energy needed

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
and the force needed

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
will be higher.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
So why is L's fracture strength

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
higher than T's?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
T's fracture strength

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
is basically parallel

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
to the fracture surface.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
So basically,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
it just goes through.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
So it's easier to have

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
premature fracture.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
On the right,

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
you can see that

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
the triple junction

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
is the junction point

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
of the three meridians.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Basically,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
the force will be concentrated here.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
You can see that

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
L's sample has more force concentration.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
That is to say,

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
under the same force,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the force they share

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
is smaller.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
This is why

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
the fracture strength is higher.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
As for T's,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
it has less triple junction.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
This is why

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
it's easier to have

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
premature fracture.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
So these two points

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
add up to

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
T's fracture strength

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
which is lower than L's.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Here, we use 3-point contour

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
to measure DVTT.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
As I mentioned earlier,

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
we can use it

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
to replace fracture toughness

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
to understand DVTT.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
We did a test here.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
We found that

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
L's DVTT

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
is lower than T's.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
That is to say,

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
L can deform

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
at a lower temperature.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
However,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
T can't.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Let me remind you that

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
T and TL

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
have the same fracture strength.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
L and LT are the same.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
But I use different symbols

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
because T is for

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
8-centimeter fissure

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
and TL is for

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
3-point contour fissure.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
As you can see,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Advanced Tungsten Grade

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
has higher DVTT.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
As for

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Heavily Formed Tungsten

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
and Tungsten Alloy,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Tungsten Alloy

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
has lower DVTT

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
than 100°C.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Why is this the case?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Why is Advanced Tungsten Grade

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
has higher DVTT?

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
We found that

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
if you have

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Raw and Forged Tungsten,

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
their

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Low Angle Ground Boundary Density

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
is higher.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
What is Low Angle Ground Boundary?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Low Angle Ground Boundary is

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
the boundary between

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
the two

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
less than 15°C.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
The boundary

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
is Low Angle Ground Boundary.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Low Angle Ground Boundary

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
can have

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
dislocation nuclei

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
on top of it.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
They can generate

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
a new dislocation source.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
If you have more

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Low Angle Ground Boundary,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
you can have more dislocation.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I just mentioned that

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
you must have dislocation

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
to have Plasticity Formation.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
That's what I was talking about

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
when I talked about the

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
single-strand boundary.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
The more dislocation you have,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
the more likely you are to have

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Plasticity Formation at low temperature.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
That's why

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
these fissures

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
have lower Plasticity Formation.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
We have analyzed

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
the difference between

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Fracture Surface and

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Fissure Pattern.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
On the left,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
you can see the IGP,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Commercial Tungsten.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
This is the tungsten

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
purchased by the company.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Fracture Pattern

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
is closely related

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
to Fissure Pattern.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Its denomination is

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
these small cracks.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
These cracks

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
appear when the temperature is over 400°C.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Why do these cracks

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
look like this?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Why do these cracks look like this?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
We can explain it

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
from the perspective of the crystal.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
You can see the L-sample,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
the sample above.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
You can imagine the crystal

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
protruding from the screen

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
pointing at you.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
As I mentioned,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
the Wicked String

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
is the weakest.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
The cracks like to go that way.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
You can see the cracks

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
going along the crystal

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
or crossing.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
The T-Orientation

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
is like this.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The crystal

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
is arranged one by one

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
on the screen.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
It's like when you fold

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
a piece of wood.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
If you fold it along the fiber,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
it will look like this.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
As for the Advanced Tungsten Grade,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
their crystal is basically

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
in the same axis.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
The cracks are easily

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
to go along the crystal

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
or cross the crystal.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
They are extended

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
along the crystal.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
They are basically

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
many intergranular fractures.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
There are also partial

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
trans-crystal fractures.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Trans-crystal fractures are

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
pointed by the green lens

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
which is the

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
trans-crystal fractures.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
The trans-crystal fractures

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
show the grain shape.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
At higher temperatures,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
we can only see

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
the fine grain

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
which is called FG.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
There are also dimples

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
which show the cracks.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Let's talk about

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Irradiated Results.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
As I mentioned,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
we also applied

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
the Inter-Rodent Tensile Type

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
to Irradiated Tungsten.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
We can see the results.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
We have estimated

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
the DVT-T.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You can see the two materials

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
of DVT-T.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Recoil-Covered Reinforced Tungsten

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
and ATW,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
which is commercial tungsten.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Their DVT-Shift

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
is almost the same,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
which is 200 to 250 degrees.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Why do we have a range here?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Although these points

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
have been measured

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
to see if they are irradiated,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
their large

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
refractive deformation

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
is basically non-existent.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
They have small refractive deformation,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
which means that the

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
refractive electric field

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
is directly cut off.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
As you can see,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
the transition curve

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
basically has a range.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Therefore,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
there is such a phenomenon.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
When there is a transition range,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
the refractive deformation

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
is relatively small.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
As you can see,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
the stress increase

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
of the two materials

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
is basically

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
doubled.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Here,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I did some tests

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
of Frager-Thomas.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
You can see that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Frager-Thomas's

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
refractive deformation

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
increases as the

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
refractive field increases.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Here, I tested

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
the temperature at 600 degrees,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
so all the points are made at 600 degrees.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
The radiation condition

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
is also at 600 degrees.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
As you can see,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
when the

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
DPA of the radiation is getting higher

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
to 0.7,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
it basically

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
reduces the

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
refractive deformation

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
of the material.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
In other words,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
it becomes

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
brittle.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It basically becomes very brittle.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
In addition,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
we also found that

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
the

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
tungsten of

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
ATW

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
also increases

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
the refractive deformation

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
as the

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
refractive field

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
increases.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
This can prove

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
that the

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
refractive field

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
also goes

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
directly

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
through the

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
crystal.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It's not just

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
the crystal.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
We also did

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
the Transition Curve Estimation.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I just mentioned that

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
the 23 MPa root meter

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
cannot be used.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Why?

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Because it cannot be used,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
we need two

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
experiment temperatures

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
to do the

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Transition Curve Estimation.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Because we have

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
the reference

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Frasier-Thompson test,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
the non-irradiated

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Frasier-Thompson test

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
uses the Frasier-Thompson test.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
The K-base is 47,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
and the rest is calculation.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
As I mentioned,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
the 23 MPa

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
root meter cannot be used,

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
so we redefine the DPET

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
as Tf.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Tf is the

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
anti-curve point.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The curve anti-curve point.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
As you can see,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
after the radiation,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
the

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Tf

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
drops to

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
23 MPa.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Why?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Because

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
the Tf

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
drops to

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
23 MPa,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
and the DPET

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
goes higher.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
If I use the anti-curve point

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
as the definition,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
the IGP

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
grows only 20 degrees.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
If I use the

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
anti-curve point as the

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
definition,

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
the ATW

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
grows 100 degrees.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
If I use the anti-curve point

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
as the definition,

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
the ATW

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
grows 200 degrees.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The last curve,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
the green curve,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
is not a good fit.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
The K-top

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
is too close

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
to the K-base.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
The fitting is weird.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
We need

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
a higher temperature

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
for the test,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
so we can get more

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
experimental points.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
But as we

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
saw,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
we can say

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
the point on the right,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
the 0.7,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
the DPA

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
is higher than 600 degrees.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
No,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
No,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Here,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
we use the hardness test

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
to evaluate the

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
irradiation harmony,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
which is the hardness

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
after corrosion.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
As you can see,

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
the highest change

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
in most materials

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
is in

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
irradiation harmony

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
at 1000 degrees.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
At higher temperature,

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
as we mentioned,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
there will be annealing.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Many DPETTs are annealed,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
so the temperature drops.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
But it's still high,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
as you can see,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
it's similar to 600 degrees.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
We haven't done

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
the TEM yet,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
but we are doing it.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
We need to prepare the TEM

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
and use GLOBAL,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
so we need to do it directly.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Many materials

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
have high irradiation harmony,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
so we are still waiting for it to cool down.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
We haven't done

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
the TEM yet,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
but according to the document,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
at higher temperature,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
the chance of voice

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
will be higher,

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
the voice density

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
will be higher than

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
the dislocation density.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
So,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
these two parts

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
are composed of voice.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
At 1200 degrees,

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
the voice density will be higher.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
In addition,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
the current theory

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
states that

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
the higher the range,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
the more

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
irradiation-induced defects

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
can be absorbed.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
So, the higher the range,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
the lower the irradiation harmony.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
However,

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
IGP is higher than

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
IGA,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
even though

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
it has a lower

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
voice density.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Here is

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
a possible explanation.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
IGA and IGP

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
are pure materials.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Because

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
of the

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
self-insidious atom,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
which is a

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
self-insidious atom,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
it will produce

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Frenkel pairs,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
which is a

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
self-insidious atom

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
and a vacuum.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
The self-insidious atom

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
will form an elliptical structure

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
in the BCC,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
which has a

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
very low

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
dispersion energy.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Therefore,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
the self-insidious atom

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
can move

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
in 3D.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Therefore,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
the self-insidious atom

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
is more likely to be absorbed by the range

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and leave a lot of vacuum.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
After that,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
the voice

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
is higher than

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
the irradiation harmony.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
That's why IGA

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
has a higher voice density

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
even though

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
it has a higher range.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
In addition,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
we also know that

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
hardness and strength

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
are proportional.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Therefore,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
we try to

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
evaluate

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
the growth of

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
the curve

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
of the waist strength

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and temperature

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
after irradiation.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Here,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
we can see

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that the brown line

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
is the fractional strength.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
If it intersects

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
with the color line,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
it is basically

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
the dBTT.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The dark gray line

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
is the dBTT,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
which is the position

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
of the rotation temperature.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
However,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
all of them are not exposed.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Only IGP is exposed.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Therefore, we can suggest

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
that IGA has a better

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
resistance to irradiation damage.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
However,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
we can see that

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
the strength

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
is doubled.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
The fractional strength

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
is also doubled.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The last point is the broken point.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The broken point is also

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
doubled.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
These brown lines

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
should go up.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Therefore,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
we can't say

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
where the dBTT is.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
However,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
we can only say

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
whether the resistance

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
to irradiation is strong or not.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
We can only say that IGP

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
and Zirconia Carbide Tonsil

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
have a better resistance to irradiation.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
In addition,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
all of these hardness tests

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
are done at room temperature.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Therefore,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
some things

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
need to be considered

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
before making

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
the final decision.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Therefore,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
we still need

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
some high-temperature

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
hardness tests

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
to verify.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Fortunately,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
we will soon have

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
a high-temperature

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
hardness test device.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
We will move it

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
to the control area

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
so that we can verify

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
whether the results

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
are correct or not.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Finally,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
we can see

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
the single crystal tungsten

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
that we used

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
the unbiased hardness

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
to test.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
As I mentioned earlier,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
the hardness fluctuates

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
depending on the rotation angle.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Therefore,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
if you don't have H0,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
you won't be able to figure out

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
the exact temperature.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If you use H0,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
you will find that

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
the highest temperature

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
for hardening

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
is 800°C.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
800°C is

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
the highest temperature

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
for tungsten welding.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
After that,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
annealing occurs

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and the temperature drops slowly.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Finally,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I will summarize

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the irradiation results.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
You can see that

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
the fractional tungsten test

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
and the internal temperature test

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
are used

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
to evaluate the growth rate

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
of dPtT.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
You can see that

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
the growth rate of IgP

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
is about 0.1 dPa,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
which is much lower than AtW.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
AtW will

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
grow to

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
about 300°C

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
at 1 dPa.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
At 300°C,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
the cone covering

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
will grow to about 250°C.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I will also summarize

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
the results

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
after hardening.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
You can see that

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
the results of the tensile test

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
are very similar to

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
the hardness evaluation.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The curves I mentioned

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
can be used as a reference.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
They are basically the same

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
as the tensile test.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
In addition,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
AtW and IgP

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
have similar density.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
You can also see

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
that their hardness

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
is similar.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The theory

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
may be correct.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
In addition,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
we can also see

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
the hardness

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
of the materials

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
at different temperatures.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You can see that

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
most materials

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
decrease at 1200°C,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
except

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
titanium carbide reinforced tungsten.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This is a very special phenomenon.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
We need to

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
use TEM to study further.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Because

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
there is no annealing,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
the crack does not disappear.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
It does not become larger

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
or self-expand.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It is a very special phenomenon.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We need to

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
further

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
analyze it

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
with electromagnetic microscope.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
In conclusion,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
this is a very simple

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
take-away note.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I have developed

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
three different

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
testing methods.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
The first one is

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Miniaturized Sturmanium Test

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
and Fracture Tungsten Test.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
These tests evaluate

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
the growth rate of

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
DVDT and

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
its curve.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Interpolated Tensile Test

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
is a test

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
that can measure

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
the strength of

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
different temperatures

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
with a single test.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The last one is

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Unbiased Hardness Test.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
With this test,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
we can get

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
accurate hardness

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and hardness measurement

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
on a single test.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
In addition,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
as I mentioned earlier,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
we use

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
mechanical testing

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and observation of

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
fiber structure.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
We found that

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
the higher the

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
membrane boundary density,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
the lower the temperature

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
of the material.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
In addition,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
we found that

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
although IGP

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
does not have

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
a high density,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
its hardness

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
is relatively low.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Therefore,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
increasing the density

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
does not necessarily

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
reduce the hardness.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
This theory may be

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
based on very small

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
nanometers.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
This theory may be

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
based on very small

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
nanometers.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
This theory may be

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
based on very small

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
nanometers.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Thank you.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Thank you.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Any questions?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Any questions?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Any questions?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
There is a general question.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
We all know that

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
material is expensive.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
How much do you need

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
in Fusion Reactor?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Will it affect

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Fusion Reactor?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Basically,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
if you want to

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
use a magnetic field

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
or a laser,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
you have to spend a lot of electricity.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
If you want to use wood,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
what do you think?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Because I play Fusion Reactor.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I have always been interested in Fusion Reactor.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But I don't know much about it.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Thank you.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
What about the material?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
The material is

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
about 900 tons.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
The material is about 900 tons.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
900 tons

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
1 kg of material

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
is not that expensive.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's not that expensive.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
1 kg of material

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
is less than 100 US dollars.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
most of the

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
experience

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
of

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Fusion Reactor

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
is based on

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
the experience of

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Fusion Reactor.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The cost of materials

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
is usually the lowest.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Compared to the cost of

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
the operation,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
the cost of materials is the lowest.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
this should not affect

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
the future

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
development of Fusion.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Another thing I'm interested in

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
is that the material is basically

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
placed at the bottom

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
of Fusion Reactor.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I want to know

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
the activation rate.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
After activation,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
what is the radiation

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
of Fusion Reactor?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
For example, SIVIR.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Yes, if we use SIVIR.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
When it first came out,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
it was more than 50 mSv.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Its activation rate is not that high.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Because it only contains

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Rhinium and Osmium.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Basically,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
the composition is low,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
but you can't directly

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
contact it.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
it's not as high as

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Fusion Reactor's

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
radiation.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So, 50 mSv per hour?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yes.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That's pretty high.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Thank you.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You're welcome.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I have a general question.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Can you talk about

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
the next step of this project?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I mean the whole plan.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Which part are you talking about?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Is it Diverter or the entire

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Ether?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
What is the next step?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Ether hopes that

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
the first Ether

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
will be in 2025.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
But we estimate that

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
it will be in 2027 due to

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
some administrative issues.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Some minor issues

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
during installation.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So, the actual Ether

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
should be in 2027.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
After Ether,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
there will be a

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Demonstration Reactor

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
in Europe.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Demonstration Power Plant.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
It's called DEMO.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
They want to test

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
some new concepts

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
with Ether.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Like TDM,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
or Blanket.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
The power generation

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
depends on Blanket.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
80% of the terminal

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
will be generated here.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
As you can see,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Helium has only 3.5 MeV,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
but the terminal has 14 MeV.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
So, the main energy is in the terminal.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Fusion Reactor

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
harnesses

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
the terminal energy.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It relies on

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
the interaction between

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
the terminal and the material

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
to transfer the energy to the material.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So, Blanket will absorb the energy

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and generate electricity.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
In addition,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
in Blanket,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
you need

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Deuterium and Trillium.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
The terminal and the terminal

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
do not exist in the natural world.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So, you need to manufacture them.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
We have the terminal

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
in the Fusion Reactor,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and we use it.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
But we can't always

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
use the fusion reactor

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
to generate the terminal.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So, the concept of Ether

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
is to

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
generate the terminal by itself.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So, it contains a lot of Li.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Li generates the terminal

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
with the fusion reactor.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Then, it uses the cycle

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
to extract the terminal

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and turn it into

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
the fuel to burn.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
So,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
this concept

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
will be verified in Ether.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Some new concepts

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
in Diverter

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
such as Liquid Metal,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
can be used to

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
generate the terminal.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
However,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Liquid Metal

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
does not have this problem.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So, many new concepts

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
have appeared.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I hope that

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
it will be applied to DEMO.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
The goal of DEMO

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
is that the value of Q is greater than 10.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Q is equal to 10.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
the energy generated

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
by the fusion reactor

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
is equal to

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
10 times of the input energy.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
However,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
this is a very ambitious goal.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Because there is no fusion reactor

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
that has reached

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
this level.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Even JET has not reached this level.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It seems that

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
there is a theoretical value of 1.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
But it has not reached this level.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
the goal of DEMO

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
is greater than

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
50.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The goal is to reach the state

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
where electricity can be generated.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
So,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
this is a European project.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
However, there are also projects in other countries.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Ether is an international project.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
There are seven countries participating.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
If the EU is a country,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
there are

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
EU,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
China, India,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Japan,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
the United States,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
and South Korea.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Each country has its own DEMO.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So, there will be

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
different approaches

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
in the future.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
However,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
this is a bit of

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
imagination.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Although we have many meetings

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
that are already designing DEMO,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I dare not say that

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Ether has not been built yet.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Thank you.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It sounds like the next

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
collider of LHC.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
LHC can't finish it.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But they are already discussing

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
how to build the next one.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I know the timeline.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Thank you.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Any other questions?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I have a question.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Do you have a contact?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Or you can email me.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Yes, I do.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It depends on you.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
If our audience

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
are interested in

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
the next project,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
you can contact

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
our speaker.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
If you want to

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
review this video,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
we will upload the recording

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
in a week.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
That's all for today.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Let's give our speaker

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
a round of applause.
