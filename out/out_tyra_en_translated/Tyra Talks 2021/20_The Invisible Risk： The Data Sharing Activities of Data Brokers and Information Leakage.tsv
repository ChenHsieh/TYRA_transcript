0	11000	Good morning, good evening, and thank you for joining me today to share my screen.
11000	27000	We don't have a lot of people today, so feel free to interrupt me at any time if you have any questions, or just turn on the microphone.
27000	35000	The topic I'm going to talk about today is called Invisible Risk Data Sharing Activities of Data Brokers.
35000	41000	My co-authors are Aaron, who just got his PhD from Rutgers.
41000	44000	His PhD peers are also here.
44000	48000	He's going to go to California State University, Fullerton.
48000	51000	The other teacher is a Rutgers teacher.
52000	54000	Let me introduce myself.
54000	56000	My background is actually accounting.
56000	59000	I'm a CPA, and I'm a Certified Internal Auditor.
59000	63000	But my PhD is Management Information Systems.
63000	69000	I usually teach data analytics and data mining related courses.
69000	71000	Because of my background.
71000	75000	I'm currently on the list of Fulbright specialists.
75000	78000	I specialize in curriculum development.
78000	82000	I've worked with Computer Science before.
82000	86000	They have a task force on how to design cybersecurity curriculum.
86000	88000	So I'm in that program.
88000	92000	My research is mainly IT management and security management.
92000	94000	Almost all of them are in this area.
94000	105000	I often give lectures outside, maybe at universities, conferences, or some professional organizations.
105000	110000	I used to be a panelist at the Federal Reserve Bank.
110000	113000	About three or four weeks ago,
113000	117000	I helped them do analytics training at McDonald's.
117000	120000	I also did some training for the California Department of Justice.
120000	124000	I also gave a lecture at the Taiwan Monetary Authority.
124000	130000	In 2018, I was at KPMG, a large audit consulting firm.
130000	132000	I was a professor-in-residence there.
132000	136000	So I worked with them in New York for 10 weeks.
136000	138000	I also do projects with them.
138000	141000	I've done more than 15 projects so far.
141000	147000	I'm the incoming president of Accounting Information Systems.
147000	148000	This is my LinkedIn.
148000	150000	If you're interested.
150000	152000	About this paper.
152000	156000	Data Broker has been around for a long time.
156000	160000	It's just that it's been noticed for the past 10 years.
160000	164000	As you can see, a lot of news is about Data Brokers.
164000	168000	The earliest one I have here is from 2013.
168000	172000	I've been seeing it since this year.
172000	177000	Especially after the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal.
177000	179000	More news.
179000	181000	Who is a Data Broker?
181000	188000	A Data Broker is not the organization we usually come into contact with.
188000	192000	For example, if we go to a website.
192000	195000	We all know that it collects a lot of our information.
195000	199000	We also know that some websites will sell or share our information.
199000	203000	But the Data Broker is actually hiding behind these websites.
203000	206000	So when it's collecting data, we probably don't know.
206000	209000	For example, we have a free app on our phone.
209000	212000	Then we log in.
212000	213000	In fact, this app is free.
213000	214000	It's not free.
214000	218000	It's actually because there's an additional information sharing action behind it.
218000	219000	So it's free.
219000	222000	Or, for example, we go to the supermarket to buy something.
222000	225000	All of our purchase records and so on.
225000	227000	In fact, it's all shared behind it.
227000	231000	Or it can go to, for example, Facebook.
231000	235000	All of our public information on Instagram.
235000	237000	So the photos we posted.
237000	239000	What we wrote.
239000	240000	How to write.
240000	242000	Is it a relationship?
242000	244000	It knows all of these things.
244000	247000	There are also some public sources that it can find.
247000	250000	For example, in Illinois.
250000	254000	For example, who paid for which house's property tax.
254000	256000	That's all you can see.
256000	259000	So there's actually public registration information.
259000	263000	And then these companies will collect all of your data.
263000	267000	And if it's not enough, it will go to other Data Brokers.
267000	269000	Share it together or buy it from them.
269000	271000	And after you've bought it, you've sorted it out.
271000	274000	In fact, each of us will have a tag.
274000	276000	It can have some influence.
276000	280000	For example, this person is their family.
280000	283000	There will be a baby recently.
283000	287000	Or this person will have access to a golf club.
287000	292000	Or this person is Facebook's social media influencer.
292000	295000	It can all know that you have some preferences.
295000	297000	Or you have some characteristics.
297000	299000	It knows it all.
299000	302000	And this is the most common thing.
302000	306000	These marketing or advertising Data Brokers.
306000	309000	They can actually do it very accurately.
309000	312000	For example, when I was in another school.
312000	315000	My colleague, every time he received an advertisement letter, he asked him.
315000	316000	Do you want to buy a house?
316000	318000	Do you want to buy a new car?
318000	320000	Do you want to buy a new boat?
320000	322000	And then he got this.
322000	323000	I got it all.
323000	324000	Do you want to borrow Personal Loan?
324000	325000	Do you want to borrow Mortgage?
325000	327000	How much money do you still have to pay for Mortgage?
327000	329000	So you can see that he can know.
329000	331000	What is your current financial situation?
331000	334000	The advertisement he gave you.
334000	335000	It's all different.
335000	338000	There are also two more common ones.
338000	340000	Fraud Detection and Risk Mitigation.
340000	343000	For example, when you go to the bank to borrow money.
343000	347000	He needs to make sure that the information you give is correct.
347000	349000	It is also through Data Brokers.
349000	351000	This part is very important.
352000	357000	There are also some websites that actually allow you to find other people's websites.
357000	361000	He also collects the information of these people through Data Brokers.
361000	365000	So you can judge if that person is the one you want to see.
365000	367000	So why is this information useful?
367000	371000	That's actually because if he can get a lot of customer data.
371000	373000	Collect it all.
373000	377000	And then whether it's online or offline.
377000	379000	What happens after he finds it all?
379000	382000	Then he has a way to reconfirm these data.
382000	384000	For example, the same thing.
384000	386000	I went to find it from a lot of sources.
386000	389000	I can tell which one is right.
389000	392000	Then you can put that data quality will be much better.
392000	395000	So he has a way to use it to make some predictions.
395000	399000	Then he doesn't care what happens to each of us.
399000	402000	What he wants is this large amount of aggregated data.
402000	404000	Then he can make predictions for him.
404000	406000	After this prediction, it's actually very useful.
406000	408000	It's because he can sell it.
408000	410000	For example, this person may have to change cars next year.
410000	412000	He has a way to tell these people.
412000	415000	You can send a marketing material.
415000	420000	Or he can buy more useful information from other Data Brokers.
420000	423000	To make his data richer.
423000	427000	So you will see all kinds of Data Brokers.
427000	429000	These four are relatively large.
429000	432000	For example, Axiom is actually very large.
432000	437000	They are all doing marketing campaigns and fraud detection.
437000	442000	Then the three people in the back are for business or government.
442000	446000	For example, tell you what the financial information of these people is.
446000	449000	Or someone told you that his customer transaction.
449000	451000	What does it look like?
451000	455000	Or he can tell you that I have collected this information.
455000	457000	Not just for marketing.
457000	460000	Financial service products can be given.
460000	463000	In fact, this is when you understand all the profiles of a person.
463000	466000	In fact, all the information is very useful.
466000	469000	So what kind of information did they collect?
469000	471000	Uh, this is a bit vague.
471000	473000	Because this is a screenshot.
473000	476000	But if you can see, he actually tells you here.
476000	478000	Axiom is a big Data Broker.
478000	481000	He is a Public Traded Company.
481000	489000	He has 45 years of historical data on name changes and residential history.
489000	492000	He has all the data from the past 45 years.
492000	493000	Who are you here?
493000	494000	How did you change your name?
494000	495000	He has it all.
495000	499000	That gender, age, education level.
499000	501000	This is very simple for them.
501000	502000	He also knows you.
502000	506000	For example, what income level do you currently have?
506000	508000	What is the car?
508000	512000	Then when there is this information, he can do prediction.
512000	515000	For example, is there anyone in your household?
515000	517000	Recently planning to have a baby.
517000	520000	Or is it planning to adopt a child?
520000	522000	Or are you in the United States every year?
522000	524000	Are you paying taxes every April?
524000	526000	Or are you a heavy Facebook user?
526000	529000	Or are you easily influenced by social media?
529000	531000	He has a way to know.
531000	534000	Do you have major medical insurance?
534000	536000	All of these are known.
536000	543000	Then, surprisingly, they have more than 3000 different attributes.
543000	552000	So in the United States, everyone, if he has collected your information, he has 3000 different attributes to describe the various characteristics of this person.
552000	558000	So he actually knows very well what happened to each of us.
558000	561000	Sometimes we don't even know our own preference.
561000	563000	But these data brokers will know.
563000	567000	Then you will find that this is actually quite scary.
567000	572000	The reason is because he is not the organization we will directly contact.
572000	573000	For example, we go to Amazon.
573000	574000	We know Amazon.
574000	575000	We go to Facebook.
575000	576000	We know it's him.
576000	580000	But he's actually doing these things behind the scenes.
580000	589000	So in 2014, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, they actually have two articles.
589000	591000	They're all talking about this.
592000	598000	What they're talking about in these two articles is actually that they're talking about data brokers.
598000	604000	Their biggest problem is that we don't know what he's doing.
604000	607000	We don't know what information he's collecting.
607000	611000	We don't know what he's doing with our information.
611000	613000	How to share it, how to sell it, who to sell it to.
613000	618000	In fact, we all don't know that his whole practice is actually a black box.
618000	621000	So we don't know what they're doing at all.
621000	632000	So this Federal Trade Commission in 2013 and 2014, we hope that everyone can have some action to limit that.
632000	637000	At least let us know more about what these data brokers are doing.
637000	640000	So this is the main content of these two articles.
641000	645000	So what they're talking about is a very interesting thing, which is data brokers.
645000	652000	They're actually competing with each other to see who they can sell their data to.
652000	654000	So there's no problem.
654000	656000	But they're not actually competing with each other.
656000	658000	They're actually cooperating with each other.
658000	661000	For example, they asked nine data brokers.
661000	666000	And then they'll know where each data broker comes from.
666000	670000	For example, you're collecting public data from government agencies.
670000	675000	Or it could be any other publicly available source.
675000	677000	But it could be commercial sources.
677000	680000	Or it could be collected from another company and given to you.
680000	685000	You'll see that these nine data brokers actually have very different ways of collecting data.
685000	688000	Some people only use commercial sources.
688000	690000	Some people use everything.
691000	695000	And the most special thing is that although they're usually competing for clients,
695000	697000	that is, who can buy their data,
697000	701000	but you can see that their data is actually shared with each other.
701000	703000	Or you can say, ah, I've collected this data today.
703000	705000	And then if you need it, I'll sell it to you.
705000	709000	So you can see that they're a very complex network.
709000	712000	And in these nine, there are actually only seven,
712000	714000	which is the one on the bottom left.
714000	717000	The seventh is that it has nothing to do with other data brokers.
717000	720000	There are no data sharing activities.
720000	724000	Everyone else will buy or sell to a certain extent.
724000	726000	Or where do you share it from?
726000	728000	They all have it.
728000	731000	This thing is very interesting to us.
731000	735000	The reason is because if they don't just collect it themselves,
735000	738000	they'll take other people's stuff and use it together.
738000	745000	If today the hacker can attack a certain data broker,
745000	747000	it's actually like a grand prize.
747000	750000	The reason is because the data you get is not just his.
750000	753000	All the information you get and all the other people,
753000	756000	all the information they share with each other.
756000	758000	That's actually our hypothesis.
758000	762000	It's just that we later found out that there really was this thing.
762000	767000	For example, many years ago, in 2018,
767000	769000	Equifax had a big breach.
769000	775000	They forgot to update their software inside,
775000	777000	so they had a big breach.
777000	782000	Their breach is actually not just Equifax's data being leaked.
782000	784000	In addition to Equifax,
784000	786000	the other two big credit bureaus,
786000	788000	which is Experian and TransUnion,
788000	790000	are actually all leaked.
790000	794000	In fact, our data collection is from Dark Web.
794000	796000	So we actually found that
796000	799000	if you go and find Equifax's data breach,
799000	801000	you can actually see the data of the other two.
801000	804000	It's actually all mixed up.
804000	808000	There's also some anecdotal evidence.
808000	810000	When Equifax had a breach,
810000	814000	the other two reported the credit fraud data.
814000	818000	So all the data is actually leaked.
818000	820000	If we go to, for example, Google Trend,
820000	823000	and look at their fraud report trend,
823000	827000	you'll find that these three are actually almost the same trend.
827000	828000	One company has a problem,
828000	830000	and the other two have a problem.
830000	834000	We think that this is definitely because
834000	839000	of the influence of the exchange of information between them.
839000	841000	So as long as one person has a problem,
841000	843000	everything will happen.
843000	844000	That's a lot of trouble.
844000	846000	So you'll see that in fact,
846000	851000	there are a lot of regulations in the United States.
851000	853000	They've been around since 2013.
853000	857000	The early focus was actually that
857000	861000	these data brokers should let those consumers know
861000	865000	what kind of data they've collected.
865000	867000	So in 2013 and 2014,
867000	870000	Axiom would actually let every user,
870000	871000	no matter who you are,
871000	872000	you go and log into your data,
872000	874000	and then you can see what information you have.
874000	876000	You can see it all.
876000	878000	There are also some other points that
878000	881000	they feel are not transparent at all.
881000	882000	What is your practice?
882000	883000	What did you collect?
883000	884000	Who did you sell it to?
884000	887000	So far, it's all black box.
887000	889000	This is early 2013 and 2014.
889000	891000	And then in 2018 and 2019,
891000	893000	there were two new things.
893000	895000	In Vermont,
895000	897000	there's a data broker law.
897000	898000	It says,
898000	900000	if you're a data broker,
900000	902000	we'll talk about its definition later.
902000	904000	If you're a data broker,
904000	909000	you should register with its Secretary of State.
909000	910000	To register,
910000	911000	simply put,
911000	912000	before the end of January every year,
912000	913000	you have to go to its website
913000	916000	and provide all your data to it.
916000	918000	The provided data actually looks like this.
918000	920000	Which company are you from?
920000	921000	What is your website?
921000	925000	And then if the user doesn't want you to collect information,
925000	926000	can you opt out?
926000	928000	I don't want you to collect.
928000	930000	So how do you do it?
930000	933000	It actually has all the details of the disclosure.
933000	934000	Or it says,
934000	937000	do you have any
937000	939000	statement about opt-out
939000	941000	or data collection?
941000	943000	You can actually write it up.
943000	946000	This example is written a lot.
946000	947000	Some companies,
947000	948000	although it says it's registered,
948000	949000	but in fact,
949000	951000	you'll see that there's no information at all.
951000	953000	A lot of them just say,
953000	954000	please see our website.
954000	955000	If you click on it,
955000	957000	there's nothing there.
957000	958000	You can hardly see it.
958000	959000	This is one.
959000	962000	The second question is actually
962000	963000	data broker,
963000	968000	even if it meets the definition of regulation,
968000	970000	it's a data broker.
970000	972000	If it doesn't register,
972000	975000	the penalty is actually very low.
975000	977000	I forgot if it's Vermont or California State.
977000	979000	If you don't register,
979000	981000	you'll only be fined $100 a day.
981000	983000	And it's online.
983000	984000	I've been fined,
984000	985000	for example,
985000	987000	$10,000,
987000	988000	and I can't pay anymore.
988000	989000	For data brokers,
989000	991000	this is almost nothing.
991000	993000	They might make more than $10,000 a day.
993000	994000	So,
994000	995000	uh,
995000	997000	the penalty is actually not that big.
997000	999000	It's not like GDPR,
999000	1003000	which has such a big impact on European privacy regulation.
1003000	1004000	If you have a violation,
1004000	1008000	it's just a few percent annual sales revenue.
1008000	1009000	So,
1009000	1011000	the effect of this thing is not that good.
1011000	1012000	So,
1012000	1014000	it's actually very simple to define.
1014000	1016000	Simply put,
1016000	1018000	when a company,
1018000	1020000	you know you're collecting data,
1020000	1022000	or you know you're selling it,
1022000	1024000	you take the data you've collected and sell it.
1024000	1026000	And then it's actually a data broker.
1026000	1028000	As long as you collect the data and sell the data,
1028000	1030000	you're not directly facing those customers,
1030000	1032000	it's actually a data broker.
1032000	1033000	So,
1033000	1034000	uh,
1034000	1035000	it's actually a pretty big definition.
1035000	1036000	But actually,
1036000	1037000	you have to think about this definition.
1037000	1038000	It's very simple.
1038000	1039000	For example,
1039000	1041000	if you only collect data,
1041000	1043000	buy the data and use it yourself,
1043000	1045000	you're not a data broker.
1045000	1046000	Or,
1046000	1047000	say,
1047000	1049000	the data you collect is actually your customer's data.
1049000	1050000	For example,
1050000	1051000	Amazon,
1051000	1053000	what I collect is actually the data of these people who buy things from me.
1053000	1055000	And then I take these things and sell them.
1055000	1056000	Actually,
1056000	1057000	I'm not a data broker.
1057000	1058000	So,
1058000	1059000	there's actually a loophole.
1059000	1060000	So,
1060000	1061000	that's going to cause some problems.
1061000	1063000	A lot of companies are actually data brokers,
1063000	1065000	because they're actually doing business.
1065000	1066000	But,
1066000	1067000	uh,
1067000	1068000	according to this law,
1068000	1070000	you can't actually see it.
1070000	1072000	The California State is the same.
1072000	1073000	Uh,
1073000	1074000	that is,
1074000	1076000	if you go to his Attorney General's office,
1076000	1078000	you can also see this big,
1078000	1079000	uh,
1079000	1081000	almost all the requests are exactly the same.
1081000	1083000	It's just that it started working a year later.
1083000	1085000	It started working in January 2020.
1085000	1087000	All the definitions are the same.
1087000	1088000	Almost everything is the same.
1088000	1089000	Although,
1089000	1090000	uh,
1090000	1093000	California's privacy regulation is actually more strict.
1093000	1095000	But it's actually the same in this regard.
1095000	1096000	So,
1096000	1099000	the information he's going to reveal is actually almost the same.
1099000	1100000	So,
1100000	1101000	uh,
1101000	1103000	if you don't have a chance to go to their website,
1103000	1105000	you can see something like that.
1105000	1106000	So,
1106000	1107000	uh,
1107000	1109000	let's talk about it very quickly.
1109000	1110000	Uh,
1110000	1111000	we think,
1111000	1115000	why do they compete with each other and cooperate with each other?
1115000	1118000	Why do you think this is going to happen to them in the future?
1118000	1120000	Security breach or,
1120000	1121000	or,
1121000	1122000	or information will,
1122000	1123000	will,
1123000	1124000	will be stolen by someone.
1124000	1126000	This state is actually related to the reason.
1126000	1129000	The first big point is actually not in this.
1129000	1131000	Competition or data sharing.
1131000	1135000	It's actually because it's actually an unregulated industry.
1135000	1136000	He said,
1136000	1137000	he said,
1137000	1139000	everything is actually self-regulated.
1139000	1141000	They have their own privacy standards.
1141000	1143000	They have their own norms.
1143000	1144000	But,
1144000	1145000	uh,
1145000	1146000	for us,
1146000	1147000	in fact,
1147000	1148000	they are unregulated.
1148000	1149000	That is.
1149000	1151000	You take your information and share it.
1151000	1152000	Uh,
1152000	1153000	what is your penalty?
1153000	1154000	Or,
1154000	1155000	what can be shared?
1155000	1157000	What can't be shared?
1157000	1158000	In fact,
1158000	1160000	there are no restrictions at all.
1160000	1161000	Simply put.
1161000	1162000	So,
1162000	1164000	if there is a hacker.
1164000	1166000	If you can find a data broker,
1166000	1168000	if you can take all his information,
1168000	1169000	the impact will be great.
1169000	1170000	So,
1170000	1171000	this is why,
1171000	1172000	like Equifax,
1172000	1173000	the main one.
1173000	1174000	In fact,
1174000	1176000	the main one is a data broker.
1176000	1178000	If there is a breach,
1178000	1180000	it will have a great impact.
1180000	1182000	These information can actually be sold.
1182000	1183000	So,
1183000	1184000	that will have a greater impact.
1184000	1185000	So,
1185000	1186000	there are more benefits.
1186000	1187000	So,
1187000	1189000	people are more likely to want to go,
1189000	1190000	uh,
1190000	1191000	get your information and sell it.
1191000	1192000	So,
1192000	1194000	this paper is still in a very rough stage.
1194000	1195000	But I think,
1195000	1196000	uh,
1196000	1197000	we still hope to be able to present.
1197000	1199000	And then I hope to give you some awareness.
1199000	1200000	Or,
1200000	1201000	uh,
1201000	1202000	some extra ideas.
1202000	1203000	Especially in,
1203000	1204000	uh,
1204000	1206000	how to protect privacy protection.
1206000	1207000	Or,
1207000	1208000	how to be more,
1208000	1210000	more effective to understand what they are doing.
1210000	1211000	So,
1211000	1212000	uh,
1212000	1213000	you will see that in fact,
1213000	1214000	our hypothesis,
1214000	1215000	in fact,
1215000	1216000	everything is still in a very rough stage.
1216000	1217000	So,
1217000	1219000	but we still hope to be able to share more.
1219000	1220000	So,
1220000	1221000	the other one is,
1221000	1222000	uh,
1222000	1224000	we want to know if this registration has any impact.
1224000	1225000	Uh,
1225000	1226000	we,
1226000	1227000	of course,
1227000	1228000	we let these broad data brokers,
1228000	1229000	they are all transparent.
1229000	1230000	Or,
1230000	1231000	everyone knows who they are.
1231000	1232000	Will they say,
1232000	1233000	their practice is better?
1233000	1234000	They are more transparent.
1234000	1235000	Or,
1235000	1236000	they have some pressure to say,
1236000	1237000	they can't be so easy.
1237000	1238000	There will be a security breach.
1238000	1239000	But the problem is actually in,
1239000	1240000	not this regulation.
1240000	1241000	In fact,
1241000	1242000	because even if you don't register,
1242000	1243000	it doesn't actually work.
1243000	1244000	So,
1244000	1245000	uh,
1245000	1246000	I think,
1246000	1247000	uh,
1247000	1248000	I think,
1248000	1249000	uh,
1249000	1250000	I think,
1250000	1251000	uh,
1251000	1252000	uh.
1252000	1253000	So,
1253000	1254000	uh,
1254000	1255000	so.
1255000	1256000	Uh,
1256000	1257000	so,
1257000	1258000	uh,
1258000	1259000	uh,
1259000	1260000	so.
1260000	1261000	Uh,
1261000	1262000	so.
1262000	1263000	Uh,
1263000	1264000	uh,
1264000	1265000	so.
1265000	1266000	uh,
1266000	1267000	so,
1267000	1268000	uh,
1268000	1269000	uh.
1269000	1270000	Uh,
1270000	1271000	uh.
1271000	1272000	Uh,
1272000	1273000	uh.
1273000	1274000	Uh,
1274000	1275000	uh,
1275000	1276000	uh,
1276000	1277000	uh,
1277000	1278000	uh,
1278680	1279680	so.
1279680	1280680	Uh,
1280680	1281680	uh.
1281680	1282680	So,
1282680	1283680	uh.
1283680	1284680	So,
1284680	1285680	uh.
1285680	1286680	So.
1286680	1287680	Uh,
1287680	1288680	uh.
1288680	1289680	Uh,
1289680	1290680	so.
1290680	1291680	Uh,
1291680	1292880	so.
1292880	1293880	Uh,

2105020	2106020	Conclusion.
2108020	2110020	This research is actually very rough.
2110020	2112020	That's actually an ongoing project.
2112020	2114020	Actually, we've always wanted to keep going.
2114020	2118020	The focus of our presentation today is actually that we want to
2118020	2121020	improve everyone's awareness of data brokers.
2121020	2124020	Or I hope to encourage everyone to say that if you are interested,
2124020	2126020	you can join this project.
2126020	2130020	So we can think about how we can do it.
2130020	2134020	Uh, more accurately or more effectively.
2135020	2136020	Data collection.
2137020	2138020	Sharing the practices.
2143020	2144020	Privacy protection.
2151020	2152020	Privacy regulation.

2172020	2173020	Transparency.
2178020	2179020	Talk.
2184020	2185020	Stop sharing.
2195020	2196020	No problem.
2197020	2198020	Very clear.
2208020	2211020	I just want to think about it.
2211020	2216020	I don't know much about this, but I think it's a very important issue.
2216020	2219020	I want to share with you.
2220020	2223020	How do you protect your own data?
2223020	2226020	For example, because every website you use now has cookies.
2226020	2228020	Then you have to accept or reject.
2228020	2231020	Then there's something we can do to protect it.
2231020	2233020	Or it's already too late.
2233020	2236020	Our profile is already known to everyone.
2236020	2239020	We found that most of the data is already out there.
2239020	2241020	So we have to protect it.
2241020	2243020	We have to protect it.
2243020	2245020	We have to protect it.
2245020	2247020	We have to protect it.
2247020	2249020	So most of the data is already out there.
2249020	2252020	And then I'm trying something now.
2252020	2254020	It's a cookie on the website.
2254020	2257020	For example, I'm connected to Wall Street Journal today.
2257020	2258020	I'm connected to Amazon today.
2258020	2259020	What's behind it?
2259020	2262020	Collecting our data or activity.
2262020	2265020	Uh, we found that actually.
2265020	2268020	I can't control it in the middle of an upper bound and lower bound.
2268020	2270020	Upper bound is to say.
2270020	2272020	Uh, I'm Google today.
2272020	2274020	In the situation of signing in.
2274020	2276020	So Chrome knows who I am.
2276020	2278020	In that case,
2278020	2280020	In fact, they collect a lot of data.
2280020	2282020	It's pretty amazing.
2282020	2285020	But if I'm not logged in at all.
2285020	2288020	My browser is open again in private mode.
2288020	2290020	That can be limited to the amount.
2290020	2292020	It's a lot worse.
2292020	2293020	So that's another way.
2293020	2295020	Just try to close it.
2295020	2296020	No way.
2296020	2299020	There are some cookies that are actually more troublesome.
2299020	2301020	Uh.
2301020	2302020	Although he told you,
2302020	2303020	Do you want to accept it?
2303020	2305020	But in fact, whether you accept it or not.
2305020	2306020	That's the way it is.
2306020	2308020	You can't see any effect.
2308020	2311020	There are some websites that can make you willing to let you choose.
2311020	2313020	Uh, different cookies.
2313020	2314020	At that time, there was.
2314020	2315020	But some of them can't be turned off.
2315020	2317020	Because he has to know who you are.
2317020	2319020	Otherwise, you can't browse the website.
2319020	2321020	Yeah, so, uh.
2321020	2322020	There are still some restrictions.
2322020	2324020	Yeah, but, uh.
2324020	2326020	You'll know that they've actually collected a lot of data.
2326020	2328020	In fact, you probably know who we are.
2328020	2330020	What are we doing?
2330020	2332020	Um.
2332020	2334020	Yeah, that's terrible.
2334020	2336020	Yeah, well, uh.
2336020	2338020	I have another one with a computer science.
2338020	2339020	Before doing it.
2339020	2342020	We can actually use it.
2342020	2345020	Posts on social media.
2345020	2347020	We have a way to predict, uh.
2347020	2350020	Buying clothes or buying accessories.
2350020	2351020	Preference.
2351020	2353020	And then there's that.
2353020	2354020	We can know that.
2354020	2356020	What kind of clothes do you like to wear next season?
2356020	2357020	Color, brand.
2357020	2361020	And that prediction accuracy rate is probably over 90%.
2361020	2364020	That, uh, that's a lot of trouble.
2364020	2365020	It's just that we do it ourselves.
2365020	2366020	It's just that we collect it ourselves.
2366020	2367020	We have a very small part of the data.
2367020	2369020	We can do it so well.
2369020	2370020	You can tell that they're going to do it.
2370020	2373020	It's actually easier.
2373020	2375020	Then you would think.
2375020	2378020	Try not to post your own.
2378020	2380020	Too many personal things.
2380020	2382020	Or preferences or something.
2382020	2383020	But I think.
2383020	2385020	We still have a question.
2385020	2386020	I think so.
2386020	2388020	This is a preference.
2388020	2389020	Uh.
2389020	2391020	Uh, if we don't share this information.
2391020	2395020	We can't have those customized services.
2395020	2397020	Our search will be very bad.
2397020	2399020	Uh, it's almost not what you want.
2399020	2401020	Yeah, so if we want.
2401020	2403020	You can't do anything about the specific service.
2403020	2404020	You have to write, right?
2404020	2406020	But this is actually a preference.
2406020	2408020	So I'm talking about what they said to Google before.
2408020	2410020	That's more accurate.
2410020	2412020	What is your privacy?
2412020	2414020	It's your own decision.
2414020	2415020	It's actually from 0 to 100.
2415020	2417020	How much do I want to share?
2417020	2419020	It depends on what you like.
2419020	2421020	It's not necessarily a bad thing.
2421020	2423020	Then we have a question.
2423020	2425020	Uh.
2425020	2427020	You are me.
2427020	2429020	My name is Chen Peiying.
2429020	2431020	I am now at Indiana University.
2431020	2433020	Read information science.
2433020	2435020	Although I don't do data privacy related issues.
2435020	2437020	But because this is very popular now.
2437020	2439020	So I just wanted to say.
2439020	2440020	Let's listen to the speech.
2440020	2442020	I think there are a lot of gains.
2442020	2444020	Especially this kind of data broker role.
2444020	2446020	At least in our field.
2446020	2448020	This kind of investment information related area.
2448020	2450020	In fact, it is less mentioned.
2450020	2452020	Everyone is basically targeting a single website.
2452020	2454020	This kind of.
2454020	2456020	Uh.
2456020	2458020	Data privacy is being discussed.
2458020	2460020	So my question is, since this is a data broker.
2460020	2462020	Um.
2462020	2464020	How do you say they are very critical?
2464020	2466020	They have so much data on their hands.
2466020	2468020	Why would they let their own data so easily?
2468020	2470020	Give it out.
2470020	2472020	Just their own privacy.
2472020	2474020	Their own privacy.
2474020	2476020	Their data security.
2476020	2478020	And because once they are leaked.
2478020	2480020	Just assume that I am a.
2480020	2482020	I have that data set.
2482020	2484020	But I was harmed.
2484020	2486020	This information is somehow.
2486020	2488020	It is available on the website.
2488020	2490020	Yeah.
2490020	2492020	Isn't he supposed to prevent this from happening?
2492020	2494020	Yeah.
2494020	2496020	So we think it's very.
2496020	2498020	This is the weirdest thing we think.
2498020	2500020	And you see there are so many competitors.
2500020	2502020	To say that this is actually a very.
2502020	2504020	Profitable business.
2504020	2506020	So there will be thousands of companies.
2506020	2508020	In fact, doing this kind of thing.
2508020	2510020	But their information is.
2510020	2512020	Everyone has it.
2512020	2514020	But he can still continue to sell.
2514020	2516020	So why do we want to know more?
2516020	2518020	What are they doing?
2518020	2520020	And what happened?
2520020	2522020	But the problem is that they are actually hidden players.
2522020	2524020	That is.
2524020	2526020	They don't even know who they are.
2526020	2528020	Or the company name.
2528020	2530020	It doesn't make sense.
2530020	2532020	It's like a mess.
2532020	2534020	It's like we're talking about it in class.
2534020	2536020	So I can't find them at all.
2536020	2538020	So if there are more people.
2538020	2540020	You can jump in and find a way to know.
2540020	2542020	Who are they?
2542020	2544020	What are they doing?
2544020	2546020	That would be very helpful.
2546020	2548020	We would love to know.
2548020	2550020	Because.
2550020	2552020	That will have a lot of impact.
2552020	2554020	Because, for example, Amazon or Google.
2554020	2556020	They are actually sitting on a mountain of data.
2556020	2558020	So if we can find their security.
2558020	2560020	It would be very useful.
2560020	2562020	Like Amazon, he actually.
2562020	2564020	He put his report.
2564020	2566020	It's their information system.
2566020	2568020	The audit report of security control.
2568020	2570020	It's all shared on the website.
2570020	2572020	They are very confident that we are very good.
2572020	2574020	But these people are actually.
2574020	2576020	It's completely blank.
2578020	2580020	For example, since they have registered.
2580020	2582020	And then, although there is no URL.
2582020	2584020	Will they at least provide one?
2584020	2586020	Like a physical address.
2586020	2588020	That is to say, my company is definitely open.
2588020	2590020	In a place like this.
2590020	2592020	They have a physical address.
2592020	2594020	Like a registered address and a phone number.
2594020	2596020	Is there any more.
2596020	2598020	Is there a clear geographical distribution?
2598020	2600020	Or is it actually.
2600020	2602020	I don't think so.
2602020	2604020	We can't see any.
2604020	2606020	Specific phenomenon.
2606020	2608020	Because they collect data.
2608020	2610020	In fact, there is no limit to a specific.
2610020	2612020	State or something.
2612020	2614020	Because for example.
2614020	2616020	Because after all, you can pass it on.
2616020	2618020	To another server.
2618020	2620020	Because I know they will have some distribution.
2620020	2622020	For example, I need this.
2622020	2624020	I remember it seems to be Google and Amazon.
2624020	2626020	They have to find that kind of resource.
2626020	2628020	All kinds of natural resources.
2628020	2630020	Very rich place.
2630020	2632020	I want to have enough electricity and water.
2632020	2634020	I want to make sure he has a power outage.
2634020	2636020	Very warm.
2636020	2638020	But these things are actually.
2638020	2640020	It's not a company.
2640020	2642020	It's not their physical address.
2642020	2644020	Must be.
2644020	2646020	Not necessarily related.
2646020	2648020	Their company may be very small.
2648020	2650020	Because they are actually not sitting in the office at all.
2650020	2652020	Those people.
2652020	2654020	That's right.
2654020	2656020	I was talking about this before.
2656020	2658020	Someone said that we have no way to know.
2658020	2660020	Who is the European data broker?
2660020	2662020	Because of the GDPR.
2662020	2664020	The privacy law.
2664020	2666020	His control should be stricter.
2666020	2668020	So if we can find them.
2668020	2670020	Maybe they have more information.
2670020	2672020	It's easier to know what they're doing.
2672020	2674020	But I still don't know.
2674020	2676020	That's our data source.
2676020	2678020	Where to find it.
2678020	2680020	In fact, we don't know yet.
2680020	2682020	So this is interesting.
2682020	2684020	We think this is really like research.
2684020	2686020	I don't know what I'm doing.
2688020	2690020	I think it's a very interesting relationship.
2690020	2692020	Because like you said.
2692020	2694020	It's a school hire.
2694020	2696020	He's still looking for these companies.
2696020	2698020	He's using your background.
2698020	2700020	To make a background check.
2700020	2702020	So I think there's some information hidden in it.
2702020	2704020	It's not right.
2704020	2706020	You said the school information office.
2706020	2708020	Why don't you find someone to find it directly?
2708020	2710020	Maybe you can find it.
2710020	2712020	But it may be based on various cost considerations.
2712020	2714020	We just have to sell your information to these companies.
2714020	2716020	So there is a.
2716020	2718020	There is no mutual benefit.
2718020	2720020	But I think there is a relationship between the two.
2720020	2722020	Why are these people.
2722020	2724020	Although we think they are doing something.
2724020	2726020	But in fact.
2726020	2728020	You probably.
2728020	2730020	Because it's a school.
2730020	2732020	He still relies on.
2732020	2734020	Relying on these brokers.
2734020	2736020	To provide some information.
2736020	2738020	That's like a financial institution.
2738020	2740020	We go to apply.
2740020	2742020	For example, mortgages.
2742020	2744020	He is also exchanging information with these people.
2744020	2746020	To confirm our.
2746020	2748020	Are we giving the right thing?
2748020	2750020	It's just that this side is more compliant.
2750020	2752020	This side is more highly regulated.
2752020	2754020	For example, there is something called.
2754020	2756020	Fair Credit Act.
2756020	2758020	Something like this.
2758020	2760020	We can review our credit score.
2760020	2762020	In case something is wrong, we can ask him to change it.
2762020	2764020	There is.
2764020	2766020	But like other data brokers.
2766020	2768020	If his information is wrong.
2768020	2770020	In fact, we don't know where his information is wrong.
2770020	2772020	Or where is it wrong?
2772020	2774020	If people use this to verify.
2774020	2776020	Who are we?
2776020	2778020	In case it's all different.
2778020	2780020	Then the problem is big.
2780020	2782020	Another question is.
2782020	2784020	There are so many competitors.
2784020	2786020	Their niche.
2786020	2788020	What is their selling point?
2788020	2790020	I can only think of it now.
2790020	2792020	It's just that you use some wrong information.
2792020	2794020	To earn that kind of benefit.
2794020	2796020	Because if I know there is a company.
2796020	2798020	Can provide more.
2798020	2800020	What is the so-called more accurate?
2800020	2802020	How to define it?
2802020	2804020	Right.
2804020	2806020	Or whose model is better?
2806020	2808020	Or who has it?
2808020	2810020	But there should be some data brokers.
2810020	2812020	There is really some very special information.
2812020	2814020	No one else.
2814020	2816020	They never sell it.
2816020	2818020	Because I think that's the competitive advantage.
2818020	2820020	Some of you really don't have it.
2820020	2822020	So they are not selling real data.
2822020	2824020	They are not saying that I will provide you.
2824020	2826020	All the scores of this person.
2826020	2828020	I sell it to you based on our model.
2828020	2830020	The preferences of these customers.
2830020	2832020	Both have.
2832020	2834020	Like if it's that kind.
2834020	2836020	Fraud detection.
2836020	2838020	That is.
2838020	2840020	I sell data to you.
2840020	2842020	For example, how much is the annual income of this person?
2842020	2844020	Where does he live?
2844020	2846020	That kind is sold one by one.
2846020	2848020	If it's marketing.
2848020	2850020	I just sell the model.
2850020	2852020	Ok.
2852020	2854020	Maybe I can only be sure.
2854020	2856020	These people.
2856020	2858020	That is.
2858020	2860020	Their employees may be quite smart.
2862020	2864020	It may all be automated.
2864020	2866020	YouTube is the same.
2866020	2868020	In fact, all processes are automatic.
2868020	2870020	But it's still the same.
2870020	2872020	Just like FTC said.
2872020	2874020	What are they doing?
2874020	2876020	In fact, no one still knows.
2876020	2878020	Even though everyone keeps talking about it.
2878020	2880020	But there is no information.
2880020	2882020	Too mysterious.
2882020	2884020	I hope there is a legal expert.
2884020	2886020	Can answer.
2886020	2888020	They are on the law.
2888020	2890020	Is there no regulation?
2890020	2892020	I have a student.
2892020	2894020	I told him.
2894020	2896020	Hey, you next.
2896020	2898020	When the next assembly.
2898020	2900020	You mention this regulation.
2900020	2902020	Control the data broker.
2902020	2904020	Then he said yes.
2904020	2906020	He thought about how to do it.
2906020	2908020	Because before I told him.
2908020	2910020	You know Illinois has a.
2910020	2912020	AI interview act.
2912020	2914020	That is, if you are using a machine to read.
2914020	2916020	Job applicants interview video.
2916020	2918020	You have to disclose.
2918020	2920020	This thing is all from.
2920020	2922020	We talked about it in class.
2922020	2924020	Because he was in my class.
2924020	2926020	Then I told him, he went to mention it.
2926020	2928020	Then it happened.
2928020	2930020	So he often asked me.
2930020	2932020	Is there any interesting topic?
2932020	2934020	I think they should pay attention.
2934020	2936020	I told them about the data broker.
2936020	2938020	That depends on.
2938020	2940020	How to deal with it.
2940020	2942020	Because it's all bad.
2942020	2944020	There are some controversial issues.
2946020	2948020	Thank you so much.
2948020	2950020	Thank you.
2950020	2952020	Thank you.
2956020	2958020	Any other questions?
2970020	2972020	I just want to.
2972020	2974020	You just mentioned.
2974020	2976020	I just want to share it quickly.
2976020	2978020	Information error problem.
2978020	2980020	Because I applied for a loan.
2980020	2982020	Then the information is actually.
2982020	2984020	Some information is wrong.
2984020	2986020	It's already.
2986020	2988020	It's not right to meet different people.
2988020	2990020	Then your credit score is lower.
2990020	2992020	Then you can't apply for a loan.
2992020	2994020	So your problem is.
2994020	2996020	That's a big problem.
2998020	3000020	But you can't.
3000020	3002020	Don't tell anyone.
3002020	3004020	In the United States.
3004020	3006020	If it's below the credit score.
3006020	3008020	You can see those public.
3008020	3010020	The information they grabbed.
3010020	3012020	If there is a mistake, you can tell them to correct it.
3012020	3014020	But.
3014020	3016020	Then you have to see that there is a mistake.
3016020	3018020	Otherwise, it's still very difficult.
3018020	3020020	Then if they find the data broker.
3020020	3022020	You don't know.
3022020	3024020	What did he see?
3024020	3026020	Maybe the only way to know.
3026020	3028020	How does the data broker work?
3028020	3030020	Become a data broker yourself.
3030020	3032020	Do I still have time to ask a question?
3032020	3034020	Can.
3034020	3036020	I want to ask.
3036020	3038020	The question of the background check.
3038020	3040020	In the United States, you have to find a lot of work.
3040020	3042020	In fact, they will go through a background check.
3042020	3044020	I'm just curious.
3044020	3046020	What kind of information did they get?
3046020	3048020	That.
3048020	3050020	Like.
3050020	3052020	I came here to find a job.
3052020	3054020	I found that I couldn't find it.
3054020	3056020	Because he lived in Taiwan for too long.
3056020	3058020	But how could it be possible?
3058020	3060020	I can't get the information.
3060020	3062020	If this kind of thing has always existed.
3062020	3064020	How could it be possible to receive the information?
3064020	3066020	I'm just curious.
3066020	3068020	I just moved in.
3068020	3070020	It's blank here.
3070020	3072020	You can't receive it.
3072020	3074020	Because he should not be across the country.
3074020	3076020	But he is an American citizen.
3076020	3078020	He is an American citizen, but he is blank.
3078020	3080020	Yes, so we are very curious.
3080020	3082020	How did this happen?
3082020	3084020	He said he couldn't find the background check.
3084020	3086020	Can't find any information.
3086020	3088020	This is too strange.
3088020	3090020	What our school does most often is.
3090020	3092020	What is that?
3092020	3094020	Criminal record.
3094020	3096020	No matter how light or heavy.
3096020	3098020	All have to check.
3098020	3100020	Many schools are like this.
3100020	3102020	He will have a connected identification.
3102020	3104020	I said that kind of data broker.
3104020	3106020	How many years will they say?
3106020	3108020	Will you delete all the previous information?
3108020	3110020	Will there be such a situation?
3110020	3112020	It's a good question.
3112020	3114020	How do they deal with this?
3114020	3116020	All the name changes in the past 25 years.
3116020	3118020	Residential information.
3118020	3120020	Will there be in the future?
3120020	3122020	I don't know.
3122020	3124020	How long do they have to save?
3124020	3126020	How long will they save these data?
3126020	3128020	I'm curious.
3128020	3130020	The longer it takes for me, the more useful it is.
3130020	3132020	Because after about 50 years.
3132020	3134020	You may be the only one.
3134020	3136020	You are the only one.
3136020	3138020	People with this information.
3140020	3142020	That means that company.
3142020	3144020	Maybe the company's data is not good enough.
3144020	3146020	Is that possible?
3146020	3148020	It's possible.
