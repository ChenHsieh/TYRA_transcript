Welcome everyone to today's Taira Talk. Today is December 11th.
We are very welcome to invite today's speaker, Chen Junjia.
Junjia is a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam.
He has a Ph.D. in atoms and molecules.
He is currently working on a Ph.D. in light spectroscopy.
Junjia, if I interrupt you and ask you a question, is that okay?
No problem.
Okay, let's get started.
First of all, let's welcome Junjia with a round of applause.
Junjia, we'll give you the microphone.
Okay, no problem.
Thank you Jason. Hello everyone, I'm Chen Junjia.
What I'm going to talk about today is an experiment that was carried out in the experiment team of Florian Schreck in the Netherlands.
We carried out the first series of Bose-Einstein condensation.
You can think of it as the first so-called series of radio waves.
In today's talk, first of all, I would like to introduce our experiment team.
My laser pointer is my PI.
One of our experiments is the Atom Laser Project.
In addition, we also have the Molecule Cooling Experiment and the Tweezer Experiment.
This is my outline.
First of all, I would like to briefly introduce what is Bose-Einstein Condensation.
Why is this thing interesting?
Where is the interesting part?
And why do we want to make it a series?
Next, I will introduce our experiment team.
The two main points are that we take different experiments in our experiment method.
To find a way to achieve the so-called series of some cooling systems.
Finally, achieve a series of Bose-Einstein condensation.
In effect, it is a material wave laser.
Next, I will give some future outlook.
Bose-Einstein condensation is a theory proposed by Einstein based on Bose.
Identical bosons will undergo a phase change under very low temperature conditions.
In the end, you can understand it.
Once I have reached very low temperature conditions in the experiment.
All my atoms will start to behave like waves.
In the end, all my atoms will behave like waves.
It is coherent.
You can think of it as a material wave condition.
The conditions for material waves are contrasted with temperature.
The lower the temperature, the longer the wave length.
In the end, a huge material wave will form.
This is an animation.
I stole it from the Internet.
As you can see, in the process of cooling.
The uniform material wave length of a single atom is getting bigger and bigger.
In the end, after reaching the condition of condensation.
It enters the process of phase change.
All the condensation of the population of atoms is suddenly transferred to the ground state.
It is a bit like this behavior.
Because it is a material wave.
In the experiment, we can also demonstrate that two groups of material waves interfere.
This is an interference experiment in 1997.
Two groups of atoms interact or interfere.
You can see some interference.
Why is it interesting?
Because of the so-called huge material wave in the experiment.
You can think of it as the wave function written in quantum mechanics.
There is a group of atoms today.
The function is the wave function.
You can take this group of atoms to do simulation.
You can write down some interesting Hamiltonian models.
Then you can use BEC or Einstein's integral to simulate these models.
Then observe some corresponding physics.
There is also the use of BEC in the experiment to do the experiment of atomic interference.
For quantum information researchers, there is an interesting practice.
In the experiment, you first realize BEC.
Then let it do a phase change process.
In the optical lattice, the process of phase change.
You can realize single-site occupation in the optical lattice.
That is to say, each of the optical lattice populates an atom.
You can do it through BEC.
Of course, this is just one of the methods.
The conditions for reaching BEC are relative.
The temperature is actually quite important.
The reason is that you have to meet the corresponding phase space density.
That is to say, the density of the atomic group is almost the same as the wave length of the atom.
In the experiment, you have to reach a very low temperature.
Many substances have already formed molecules under low temperature conditions.
In the experiment, you have to reach it in a thin atomic gas.
The thin atomic gas has a corresponding atomic density.
The atomic density is to prevent the formation of molecules.
That is to say, there is a time constant of molecule decay.
You want to realize it in the thin gas.
The corresponding temperature is relatively low.
In the BEC experiment, the corresponding temperature is usually hundreds to tens of nano Kelvin.
Since the 1980s, people have been interested in BEC.
The first proposal is to see the state of BEC in the thin atom.
At first, the thin atom is more suitable for such experiments.
But later, other experimental teams used the method of laser cooling to form the Bose-Einstein condensation on the EA group elements.
In 1995, the Bose-Einstein condensation was formed on the EA group elements.
Gradually, many atoms also achieved Bose-Einstein condensation.
In 2009, our experimental team realized the Bose-Einstein condensation of the thin atom.
In 2013, we realized a technology called laser cooling to BEC.
I will introduce it in the next video.
Since it has the corresponding experimental difficulty, it was realized in 1995.
Six years later, three physicists won the Nobel Prize.
The interesting thing about it is that it is a material wave.
You can understand that it has a corresponding one-to-one relationship with the laser.
First of all, you can know that there is a cavity in the laser.
After pumping the laser light into the GaN medium in the middle,
a stimulated emission is generated and the light is outcoupled.
In fact, it corresponds to a similar physical condition in BEC.
My trap is an atom cavity.
Pumping means that I need a new atom to come in.
Once the density reaches the conditions of the space density I just mentioned,
my Bose-Einstein scattering will cause my atoms to have a tendency towards ground-state populate.
It is a material wave version of the equivalent laser.
If my laser light can be outcoupled from the cavity, it is a laser.
My ultimate goal is to mix this BEC material in the cavity and form a so-called atomic laser.
How to make this thing work with the laser light?
In other words, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous material wave laser.
All the corresponding physical mechanisms,
such as pumping and stimulated emission,
must be able to achieve a continuous mechanism in the experiment.
So our ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.
The continuous Bose-Einstein condensation is just a temporary goal.
But its effect is already completed.
If my laser light is not outcoupled from the cavity,
it is the continuous Bose-Einstein condensation that we have achieved so far.
As long as the atom is not outcoupled from the cavity,
our claim is that we have achieved a continuous material wave laser.
But we did not outcouple this material wave from the cavity.
The interesting thing is that the laser version has been realized in the same year.
But the material wave laser has not been made since it was realized in 1995.
What are the benefits of continuous?
First of all, its brightness is relatively high.
Because it is continuous, the divergence of the laser is relatively small.
This is mainly due to the continuous relationship of the laser.
The continuous laser light has a stable phase.
If you are outcoupling the laser,
because you are outcoupling the laser,
your phase may be interrupted.
In other words, it does not have a continuous phase.
However, the continuous laser light provides a stable phase.
Therefore, in terms of experiments, we also hope to achieve a continuous material wave laser.
Let's look back at the laser.
The first thing we need to satisfy is population inversion and stimulated emission.
These two physical conditions provide you a magnification plus coherence.
In other words, your phase is satisfied by the stimulated emission mechanism.
In the magnification process, your phase is copied.
Therefore, the phase before magnification is a coherent condition.
In the material wave version, the phase space density must be high enough.
First, I must rely on a mechanism similar to the stimulated scattering to achieve a magnification process.
In terms of experiments, the development process is to do the laser cooling first,
then do the stimulated emission cooling, and then achieve the stimulated scattering.
The laser cooling first provides you a high enough phase space density.
Then, after the stimulated emission cooling,
because the phase space density is high enough,
the laser cooling mechanism will heat up the atoms.
At the next stage, I will do the stimulated emission cooling to achieve the stimulated scattering.
In the end, all the atoms will populate the ground state to achieve the wave 33.
In the experiment, when doing the stimulated emission cooling,
we usually turn off the laser cooling,
so that all the atoms will not be stimulated by the near-detuned light.
Therefore, we turn off the laser cooling.
In the experiment, after the first stage of laser cooling,
the stimulated emission cooling will turn off the laser cooling,
and then further achieve the wave 33.
If you think about it carefully,
the laser cooling and the stimulated emission cooling are two things that cannot be done at the same time.
Because the laser cooling still has a way to stimulate the atoms,
so I have to do the stimulated emission cooling after the laser cooling.
Next, I will introduce how to achieve the wave 33 in the experiment.
In the experiment, there are two stages of laser cooling.
The first point is the laser cooling in the second stage.
The width of the wire is very narrow.
In the experiment, we can achieve the temperature of 1 microKelvin in the second stage of laser cooling.
We invented a mechanism called transparency.
We can use this transparency to prevent the atoms from seeing the laser cooling light.
How do we do it in the experiment?
First of all, after the atoms have finished the laser cooling,
they will be trapped in a microwave.
In principle, the laser cooling light can achieve the laser cooling in the microwave.
However, the atoms can still see the laser light.
However, today I introduced a light to address the excited state
and a higher excited state.
The mechanism introduces a so-called stark shift,
which may affect the connection of the excited state.
In space, it's like letting the atoms in the middle
because of the transparency beam,
the excited state is moved.
You can imagine that there is a light in the middle,
but because the excited state has a stark shift,
it shifts far away.
In principle, the atoms in the middle can't see the light on the beam.
In the experiment, you can think about the two photos I took here.
The one in the middle is the one without the transparency beam.
I used this light to absorb the image.
In principle, the atoms can see this light,
so I can calculate the atom distribution on the corresponding equation.
Once I hit the transparency beam,
the atoms in the middle can't see this light.
When I analyze it, it can't see the light,
so it doesn't absorb my light.
So it feels like there is no atom there.
In fact, what happened was that
because of the transparency beam,
my excited state's energy shifted,
and the atoms in the middle couldn't see my light.
By doing this, we found that
we can achieve BC conditions in the experiment.
So we combined three experimental advantages.
The first advantage is that there are two stages of laser cooling.
Interestingly, the temperature of the second stage of laser cooling
can reach very low temperatures.
In the experiment, we added a very deep microscope
with a dipole trap in the middle
to increase the density in the middle to a very high level.
In the experiment, we added this transparency beam
to make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser cooling light.
In the experiment,
we added a reservoir next to it
where I can continue to do my laser cooling.
But in the middle,
I can make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.
The atoms interact with the surrounding laser cooling conditions,
so the temperature can continue to reach very low.
But in the middle,
because of the transparency beam,
the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.
They can experience the process of image transformation
without being affected by the laser cooling mechanism.
In the experiment,
we can skip the step of evaporation and cooling.
Okay, please go ahead.
Can I ask a question?
Can I go back to the page?
Okay.
Is Dimple Trick the same as the Transparent Beam?
No.
Dimple Trick is a different beam.
For example,
the wavelength is 1064 nanometers.
The high power to form this Dimple Trap
is called the dimple trap.
Dimple Trap is formed by light.
For example,
this part of the reservoir is a parallel focused light.
The dimple in the middle is focused in a vertical direction.
The dimple trap is formed in the intersection of the two.
Dimple Trap is the laser light added in a vertical direction.
The laser light makes the dimple trap deeper.
The corresponding effect is that
the density of the atom is increased in that position.
What about Transparent Beam?
I'm sorry.
What is the intersection of 1064?
It doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.
The reason is that
it doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.
Its function is not to drive a transition.
Its function is to
through this
dimple trap.
Because it doesn't correspond to any transition,
the high power is similar to the mechanism of light.
It induces the dimple trap
in the space where the laser is focused.
It induces the dimple trap
in the space where the laser is focused.
The point is that you need high power.
The laser light does not correspond to any
atoms' intersection transition.
So, in practice,
it is like a mechanism of
the dimple trap.
I see.
The reason why Transparent Beam exists is that
it corresponds to
the condition of light
from one excited state to another.
So, in practice, it can
make my original excited state
produce a star shift.
In practice, we can now
omit the phase of evaporating cooling.
Next, we need to
find a way to
produce these cooling mechanisms
simultaneously in practice.
As you can see,
my Transparent Beam looks like this.
The left side is the oven heated to 600°C.
The atoms will come out.
The first phase is Zeeman Slower.
The next phase is Blue Motte.
After Blue Motte,
the atoms will fall down
to the chamber below
to produce Red Motte.
In practice, the chamber design
looks like this.
So, all the steps of laser cooling
are essentially
realized simultaneously
in different positions in space.
So, the atoms go through
my laser cooling
using this wave length.
Then, they will go downstairs
to see the second phase of laser cooling.
So, this is the concept of the experiment.
Next, we will
make a concept map
for the experiment.
The highlight here is
the experiment chamber below.
All the laser cooling
using the narrow line width
is realized in this chamber.
In the first phase,
I can use
the wide line width laser beam
to produce 2D Motte.
The atoms will continue
to go down to the chamber below
to produce the second phase
of wide line width Motte.
After Motte,
Motte will be loaded into Dipole Trap.
Then, we will
measure the corresponding
properties of the atoms
after they are loaded into Dipole Trap.
Or their conditions.
So, in principle,
the conditions of the atoms
in Dipole Trap are very low.
The speed is also very low.
So, in principle,
the speed of the atoms
in Dipole Trap
is about 10 cm per second.
I have a question.
What is it?
It may be related to the picture you are talking about.
I just went to the last page.
I have a question.
Why is your system
physically so huge?
Is it because the distance between each station
is sufficiently separated?
Is the scale
determined by the picture
sufficient?
Good question.
First of all,
how big is the physical scale?
Of course,
the first phase is very large.
But in fact,
we want to make it smaller later.
But of course,
how far is the physical scale?
This 2D Motte,
this blue light,
because the width of the line is wide,
so in the end,
you have to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.
You can't have any
blue light conditions directly.
Because the width of the line is wide,
it actually heats your atom very effectively.
Let's put it this way.
Not only heats your atom,
but also heats your BC.
So for BC,
once there is any light,
it is in the near resonant condition
and can drive your transition,
your BC is basically excited,
and then your BC is gone.
So in practice,
we hope to achieve a continuous cooling stage.
Blue light is necessary for blue Motte,
because it effectively decelerates and cools
the atoms coming out of the atom oven.
You can think of it as a speed distribution
from 600 meters per second.
You have to go through this blue Motte,
that is to say,
make a blue Motte
to reduce it to a speed distribution
of about 6 meters per second.
Then from the speed distribution of 6 meters per second,
through another stage of Motte
to further decelerate it.
So in practice,
physically, we need to have enough space,
mainly because we want to make sure
that we finally achieve
the cooling of the BC.
In this space,
my corresponding temperature distribution
is in the tens to hundreds of nanocelvin level.
But at the beginning,
for example,
the temperature of the atomic group here
is in the one-minicelvin level.
Then the light here,
in principle,
as long as your BC is condensed,
when you see this light,
in principle, it will be activated immediately,
and your BC will be destroyed immediately.
So in practice,
our design is to ensure that
the laser cooling mechanism of the first stage
will not affect
the experimental conditions
to achieve the condensation of the BC.
So physically,
it seems that the chamber design is very large.
But this in itself is a problem of engineering.
For example,
in principle,
these attenuators and filters in the middle
are designed to reduce these scattering lights
to be able to affect
the condensation of the BC produced later.
I don't know if I have answered the question.
Yes, yes, yes.
I understand.
Thank you.
Next is the following chamber.
In principle,
after the second stage of the red mod,
we still show up in the dipole guide.
We have a deceleration mechanism.
In other words,
I just said that
I have just measured
the speed distribution of the axis in the dipole guide.
It is a speed distribution of 10 cm per second.
Then I have a deceleration mechanism.
In principle,
it also applies some physics related to the mod.
In other words,
I have a mod here.
It has a magnetic field distribution in space.
So I can use this magnetic field distribution
to do something like
Zeeman Decelerator,
a mechanism of Zeeman Slower
to do a deceleration process
corresponding to the laser cooling light.
In principle,
here you can see that
my original value is indeed decelerated.
Then,
after deceleration,
in our experiment,
we did a microscope here again.
It's a bit like
letting the atom be decelerated in the dipole guide.
It's like a turning process.
Then hide in this new microscope.
Then in this microscope,
we have to realize
and add the Transparency Beam introduced earlier.
Then I hope that
in this space,
I can realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.
Assuming that
I zoom out now.
The last microscope
looks like this in the experiment.
Here is the atom in the ground state.
Then I have a dipole
to deepen my microscope.
Let my atomic group
have a higher density here.
Then in the same position,
I have added a beam
to let my excited state
be shifted away.
So my laser cooling
only occurs around.
So the temperature of the atom here
can be very low.
But these beams
are mainly used for laser cooling
to reduce the temperature.
Then the middle part,
I want to realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.
The interaction in the middle
is basically through
my Elastic Collision
to do the heat transfer.
You can understand that
in the Reservoir part,
I try to reduce the temperature
by laser cooling.
But the light of my laser cooling
will not affect
my Bose-Einstein cluster
in the middle part.
Because in the middle atom,
I can't see the light of my laser cooling.
The heat transfer between them
is through the Elastic Collision
to do the heat transfer.
In the experiment,
the final result of all laser cooling
is to have a continuous
atom influx in the final Reservoir.
The temperature is very low,
the density is very high,
and it reaches a condition
where my phase space density is high enough.
In the middle part,
because I can't see the light of my laser cooling,
and the phase space density is high enough,
under such conditions,
I can start Bose-Enhanced Gathering.
Finally, I can achieve
a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster
in the middle part.
Now, let me tell you
that I have achieved a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster.
Of course, in the experiment,
we have to prove that it is a Bose-Einstein cluster.
Now, let me show you
what they observed in the experiment
when they first made
the Bose-Einstein cluster in 1995.
What you see now is the space distribution of the atom group.
When their temperature drops lower and lower,
you can see that the density suddenly appears in the middle.
Bose-Enhanced Scattering occurs,
resulting in Bose-Einstein clustering.
It corresponds to the sudden increase in density in the middle.
This is what they observed in the experiment.
Of course, we also tried to observe in the experiment.
I want to ask a question.
Please go ahead.
In the previous experiment,
I thought it was in the speed space.
I saw it condensate.
So, in the time and space...
You mean...
For example, these pictures are basically...
Yes.
Condensate in the speed space.
That's right.
In the speed space.
That's right.
So, actually...
You can think of it as...
In the speed space,
they did an experiment called Time-of-Flight.
In other words, if you turn off your condensate,
your atom group will start...
That is to say,
convert your speed space distribution into actual space distribution.
Then you look at the distribution of the atom group
to correspond to the original speed space distribution.
After they did the so-called Time-of-Flight,
let the atom group fly in space.
Because it doesn't have a condensate.
So, let the atom group
convert its speed space distribution
into a map out
to your space space distribution.
Convert the speed space distribution
into space space distribution.
You can see it in the experiment.
Because once you have...
That is to say,
the speed space distribution is indeed in the middle.
You have a large part of the atom group
distributed at that speed.
After converting it into space space distribution,
you can see this.
They call it Bimodal Distribution.
It's a bit like what I'm going to talk about next.
That is to say,
here you can see...
In the experiment,
at the beginning,
you can imagine that
the time has started.
Then wait for 2.2 seconds.
Then my atom group in space...
Finally, I did this Time-of-Flight.
I went to see the space distribution of my atom group.
In principle,
it meets the Boltzmann Distribution
given by some Thermal Distribution.
So, when you do fitting,
it actually meets your Gauss Distribution.
Let's put it this way.
Once you convert your speed space
through the Time-of-Flight mechanism I just mentioned,
and I'm doing 18 ms Time-of-Flight here,
and look at its speed distribution,
it does meet my Gauss Distribution.
Why is the right side higher?
It's space distribution.
Because this is position.
This is space distribution.
You turn off the laser.
Then I have a follow-up question.
For example, if you look at Time-of-Flight,
do you turn off the laser in one direction?
Or do you turn it all off?
If you turn it all off,
I guess it will diffuse
and spread to all directions.
If you look at it in one direction,
do you turn it off in one direction?
We turn it all off in the experiment.
It does diffuse in all directions in space.
But what we're looking at now
is a bit like taking a picture in space.
Of course, we do it in a certain direction.
It's a concept of a interface.
You can imagine it as
I take a picture,
and I do a point on the axis of the picture.
So it corresponds to
the speed distribution on the plane I'm looking at.
Space distribution.
Space distribution.
Because of Time-of-Flight,
it corresponds to a speed distribution.
Got it.
OK.
First of all,
when I look at it in the experiment,
my atomic group distribution looks like this.
Do you think this is Gaussian?
Actually, I have to say that
we have a landscape here.
As I just said,
the atomic group is basically
cooled in space all the way,
and then it turns around and finally enters
my final space landscape.
So here,
in principle, when we're fitting here,
let's say,
OK, I know what the space landscape looks like.
Because I know how my Dipole Trap is designed.
That is, how is the space landscape designed in space?
The atomic group's spatial distribution
is actually satisfied
under the conditions of such a space landscape.
In principle, it is a high-speed distribution.
This is what I want to say.
In today's experiment,
if I wait a little longer today,
it's a bit like saying,
when I turn it on,
at the end,
once my laser starts lacing,
I'll wait another 3.2 seconds,
and it's already lacing.
If I turn off all the lights,
and look at the spatial distribution,
the spatial distribution,
and the spatial distribution.
You can see that
it's a bit like BC's proof.
It's a bimodal distribution.
So in the first step,
I'll prove that
I've seen BC in the experiment.
Is it continuous?
In the experiment,
of course, we started doing it.
The longer I wait,
from the beginning,
0 seconds, it's gone.
Then at about 3.2 seconds,
it's almost there.
Then I waited all the way.
In principle,
the state of BC
is to continue.
In my experiment,
I measured up to 5 minutes.
That is to say, 5 minutes,
this state
has been there.
You say I can measure longer.
I can.
So in the experiment,
in principle,
we only measured up to 5 minutes.
But in principle,
this state is
that is to say,
in principle,
it has been maintained there.
It's a continuous state.
That's it.
Of course,
let's take a closer look
at the conditions of my
Boltzmann's condensation.
For example,
how much Boltzmann's condensation
did I achieve?
Here it is.
OK,
at about 3.2 seconds,
you can see that
the number of BCs
has started to increase.
Next,
we will maintain
a condition here.
Of course,
let's draw it out a little bit.
That is to say,
this is a detection
limit.
That is to say,
did I observe
my Boltzmann's condensation
above my imprecision?
In principle,
we did.
In principle,
the condition of this BC
has been maintained
here for 2 to 60 seconds.
I have a question.
Go ahead.
How did you get
the blue data
error bar?
The blue data error bar
is basically
that we measured
at least 5 times
in the same condition.
OK.
To make an error bar.
OK.
So,
the size of the error bar
is not only related to
the number of BCs,
but also related to
how many times you measured.
That's right.
OK.
So,
actually,
some numbers,
numbers,
that is,
the central value
is very close,
but the error bar is not the same size.
Is it because of the difference in this part?
Yes.
Oh,
I see.
OK.
OK.
Thank you.
OK.
Then,
let's actually look at
our BC.
Question.
Oh.
You can say it.
Look at
the previous picture.
Its
BC at a number
is up and down.
Does it have an oscillation?
Or is it already stable?
OK.
Good question.
In the experiment,
of course,
we have to say
that
our data
is not enough
to have enough confidence
to claim that
this is an
interesting
physical oscillation.
Because
it is possible
that
you don't see
a very obvious cycle
behavior.
On the other hand,
when the experiment was just done,
it was not particularly stable.
So,
the error bar is not small.
Then,
we can only say
that
we have observed
that the wave function is very clear.
It is indeed distributed
from the speed space.
That's just
that
these numbers
are from
fitting
BC
obtained
by the experiment.
So,
this fitting
is actually
how to say
In fact,
this fitting
gives
the uncertainty
is actually
not small.
In the experiment,
they are indeed
Bose-Einstein connection.
That's just that
in the
fluctuation
of shot-to-shot,
there will be
the first
stability of
the experiment itself
to what extent
plus
my fitting
corresponds to
this
uncertainty.
So,
it will give
what Yan-Yong just said.
My error bar
is actually
is
we
give a reasonable
error bar.
That
but that is to say
BC's
feature
is
there
is
exist.
So,
BC
this thing
is confirmed.
But that is to say
the number part
we are now
our experiment
above
the
stability
is not enough
for us to
claim that
we have seen
any
effective oscillation.
But
oscillation
is actually
interesting.
Because
laser itself
is
because
your analogy
just now
I really like
the
laser and
the
matter wave
to compare
that
is
we also know
that
CW laser
if you
design
oscillation
I just want to ask
that is
in this
in your system
there may be
similar mechanism?
Yes.
There will be.
In fact, there is paper
also written.
In fact,
we also want to
try to measure it.
Because
that is to say
just like you said
that is to say
this is a
with laser
some
comparative
physical system.
In fact,
the difference
is only
my origin
is quality.
My light
but
they themselves
follow some
laser
some
type of
mechanism.
So
you talk about those
oscillation
or
relaxation
that is to say
will
we expect
in
this
system
there is a way
to observe
but we
have this idea
want to go
measure
no data
have not measured
can only say
no
that
ok
that
on the experiment
I am now
to correspond to some
data after fitting
on the experiment
we achieved
almost
in such a
continuous
physical
or
laser
experiment
system
we have a way
to produce
every second
loading rate
I did not give
but
in fact
in
once
into
stable
stable conditions
after
my
Bose-Einstein connection
is almost
in this
number
7 x 10
3
7000
and
then
around
the
origin
for example
around
the reservoir
part
almost
the number
is in
700
K
when
Jason
said
we
want to see
some
for example
BEC
his
oscillation
behavior
because these
correspond to
the
laser-related
some
physical
mechanism
that
we hope
to be in the
experiment system
in the
BEC
we now
do it
to see
similar behavior
because
we can
explain
our
data
why
there seems to be
some
oscillation
behavior
like
I just
said
the stability of
our experiment
is not enough
to make us
say
that
this
corresponds
to
the
oscillation
claimed
by
the
laser
but
theoretically
now
we are
also
interested in
trying to
measure it
here
is a
from
the
original
1980s
we
really
started
to find
BEC
in hydrogen
in the
original
19 years
we
even
tried to
make
so-called
continuous
Bose-Einstein
connection
to produce
this
very low-temperature
atomic
beam
like this
and it
so-called
in the dark
means that
it is in
my
microscope
guide
that is
in a
dipole
guide
microscope
and
it
around
there is
no
near-resonant
light
that is
there is
almost
no
laser light
to heat it
to very hot
so that
the experiment is that
I am satisfied with the
experiment system
to achieve a
very cold
atomic number
like this
that
experiment
we of course
also achieved
continuous
Bose-Einstein
connection
that
next
to do
what research
is interesting
that of course
for example
continuous
super-cold
atomic number
is very interesting
that is
you put this
very cold
atomic number
through a
cavity
when
you may
let the atom
in the cavity
it has this
we call
collective
emission
of
behavior
that is
it
that
private atom
it is actually
the first stage of
light
in fact
one of the
candidates
that it
has a
very low
emission rate
that
can be used
to define
the time
in this
experiment
mechanism
or
in this
experiment
we hope
to take this
very cold
atomic number
through a
cavity
after
the
cavity
direction
to
have some
collective
that is
it has
some
corresponding
effect
and
then
in this
very
narrow
light
very
narrow
emission rate
to
do
emission
and
in principle
it can be
a very
accurate
light
that is
or
very
accurate
laser
because it is
directly from the
atomic number
itself
and then
it can
be
a new
technology of
light
that
on the other hand
of course
we have now realized
continuous wave
of course
we want to
further
put the
atomic number
from this
cavity
inside
cover out
that we
can be
called
we realized
true
continuous
atomic
laser
because
now
but today
I want to do
is that
there is a
mechanism
is also put
these atoms
from the
cavity inside
cover out
after
the realization
of this
atomic
laser
that
just
Jason
also talked
about
is that
the new
matter
wave
it
in principle
we have a
lot of
things
that we
can measure
the
gain dynamics
look like
its
oscillation
behavior
we have
no way to
measure
these
heat balance
heat imbalance
that is
non-equilibrium
some
corresponding
laser
physics
we also
hope to
observe
in this
experiment
to see
that another
course
is that
actually
new
for example
tweezers
atomic array
qubit
they
for example
this new
paper
they
say
they can
tweezers
inside
to realize
in one
of the
positions
to do
qubit
register
preparation
then
they
these
qubit
operations
in
the
concept
I can
provide
a
continuous
super
quantum
to
continuous
fill
them
in this
area
tweezers
that
you can
imagine
that
it
becomes
a bit
like
his
quantum
computer
in
this
tweezers
is a
continuous
quantum
operation
because I can
continuously
use my
super quantum
to fill
them
this
buffer
then
they
after
the operation
to do
what to do
but
I
follow
these
buffers
I can
fill
it
this
is a
concept
that
I
can
implement
in
our
new
experiment
so
this is
my
report
today
thank
you
let's
applaud
now
if
you have
any
questions
please
ask
I
have
a
question
that
if
you can
make the
system
smaller
do you
think
there is
a limit
that
you can't
make it
smaller
like
it can't
be smaller
than
some
absolute
scale
so it
is this
small
or
do you
think
there is
no
limit
if
it
is
small
I
think
iphone is
the limit
but
this is a
very big
limit
that is
the size
of the
iphone
the
main
reason is
because
some
physical
restrictions
such as
how good
my
experiment
is
to
produce
these
atoms
and then
do further
laser cooling
this
oven
depends on
the
atom steam
so you
actually have
to heat
your
atom
for
the
private
atom
,
its
heating
temperature
is actually
quite high
to 600
K
so
the
different
laser
cooling
corresponding
to the
different
laser
width
gives you
different
temperature
conditions
so
you can
achieve
this
different
phase
of a
laser
cooling
process
but
you
private
atom
itself
because
you
don't
have to
heat
your
steam
to
do
laser

you
don't
have to
