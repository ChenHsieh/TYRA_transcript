00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Taira Talk on March 20th.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
Today's speaker is Dr. Su Guanlin.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
He was a doctorate student at UIUC, and then a post-doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Today, he is going to talk about the direction of his research, which is collective light path, continuous light study, integrated process, and wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
The topic he is going to talk about today is his work at UC Berkeley.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
I think it has a lot to do with semiconductor laser and its integration.

01:00.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Let's start with Dr. Guanlin.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you, Jason. Thank you, everyone, for coming to my talk.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
I want to thank Taira for providing this platform so that we can talk about this topic today.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
My topic today is high-performance and high-performance wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
As Jason just mentioned, this is something I studied at UC Berkeley as a post-doctoral researcher.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
The unit I am currently affiliated with is Intel Labs Research Scientist.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Why do I want to mention this field in particular?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
In fact, you may not be familiar with this picture.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
This is a Wi-Fi input test web page.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
The Wi-Fi on the screen that I will connect to you today is actually built up by light integration technology.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
This is called optical transceiver.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
This green row is all optical transceiver.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
It's all equipped with light integration technology components.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
This is also the most competitive field in light integration technology.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Even though it's very competitive, it's just the beginning.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Light integration technology has actually developed a lot of opportunities.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
I personally think this technology is a very balanced combination of laser physics, light, and semiconductor manufacturing.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I think it's quite aesthetic.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So I hope to invest a lot.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
As Jason just said, if we can make good use of Terra Journal Club,

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
I believe we can find a lot of people in this field who have the same morality and then further promote it.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
My talk today is mainly divided into three parts.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The first part is the introduction.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I will introduce to you what is light integration technology.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
And some of its basics.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Then there are two examples.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I have done two examples in Berkeley.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
It's probably a very wide, widely tunable.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
It can be tuned to a few nanometers.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
And the second one is a system-level work.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
It's a laser power guiding system.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
It's kind of like we want to demo a data center.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
A very energy-saving network resource distribution system.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
This is also done by using light integration.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
The rest is my summary.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm sorry to give you a disclaimer.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Because I am now working on light integration technology.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
One of the benefits is Intel.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
My opinion today, my discovery, and my summary.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
In fact, it does not represent the company's position.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
You can think of me as a postdoc.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
What is light integration technology?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
In fact, we all know that there is nothing too fresh under the sun.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Light integration technology allows light resources to go back to the microwave resources.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
We are going to go from the table to the source.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
We are going to go from the table to the source today.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
This is what light integration technology represents.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
The essence of technology is like this.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
This technology was proposed by Stuart Miller in 1969.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
This article was a very important article.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
He mentioned three very important points.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
The first is how we get the light from the optical table to the chip.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
We have to create a certain optical distortion rate on this chip.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
It can also form a web-guided structure.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
After this thing is realized, he said.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
After this thing is realized, we can improve the stability of the whole system.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Its reliability will increase.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Unlike doing free space, we often need to adjust some components.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
When everything is on the same chip, this thing can be omitted.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
You can ignore this step.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
After this step is completed, he made the boldest prediction.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
He thinks this thing will have a certain market scale.

05:38.000 --> 05:47.000
Today, 50 years later, we can see that the light receiver is a very novel market.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
This is basically in line with his prediction.

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
What he didn't predict is that humans have broken through the synthesis process of a single chip.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
We can now synthesize more materials on a single chip.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Or we can synthesize two chips of different materials together.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
It can break the physical limit set by a single material.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
This is our hybridization material.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
At the same time, if you combine a lot of materials of different optical properties,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
you can break the physical limit set by a single material.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
This thing is also a powerful force that promotes the advancement of the industrial world and the academic world.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
This is basically the most intense field at present.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
The left side is the traditional light communication, sensing, and network systems.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
For example, last year, two terabits per second were demonstrated.

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
It's not just a light receiver, it's also a PGA.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
This is a very, very new result.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
This was in March of last year.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Then, about ten years ago,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Onchip, which was made on a single-chip,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
is the optical prime of a chip.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It has a bandwidth of 300 MHz.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
This is the last year's 30 parallel channels light radar.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
This is the most studied technology in LiDAR.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
It's a 30-channel light radar.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
This is a very large amount of transmission.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
In Japan, AIST also showed 800 Gbps data transmission.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And it's a light-operated data transmission.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And it's Lossless.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Basically, it doesn't matter how much power goes in, how much power comes out.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
No loss.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
In the more cutting-edge field,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
For example, machine learning, quantum, and NIST,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
The American Academy of Science and Technology,

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
In 2018, they demonstrated a optical frequency transmitter.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Directly in C-band, the so-called 1550nm,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
1.93kHz,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
It directly generates an optical frequency.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And its frequency can be up to 1Hz.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
That is to say, its error is only 10-14 to 10-15.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
This is a very fine frequency generator.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
A Spanish group also made an optical FPGA last year.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
It is composed of multiple unit cells.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It can do all kinds of transfer functions.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
If you want to program it, you can program it.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
A few years ago, it also came out.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Use optical circuits to make convolutional neural networks.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
It can do image vision.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Connecting these two most extreme fields,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
In fact, what can't be separated from the industrial and academic fields is our so-called high-performance light source.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Based on optical integration technology,

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
The bandwidth of our current bioluminescence laser has been compressed to about 3Hz.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Turnability has also exceeded 100nm.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This is C-band, so it is about 1550nm.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
So it can be adjusted from 14 to 1600nm.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And our optical amplifiers on the chip

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
It has now exceeded 27dB, which is 500 times the optical amplification.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It can bear 500 times the loss on the chip.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
It can continue to recover your signal.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Then there is a frequency cone.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
It can produce direct 4-cell.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
So this is a very groundbreaking work.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
In fact, these more amazing studies,

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
In fact, the following things are very basic, very fundamental things.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
It's our so-called waveguiding.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
What Miller mentioned just now,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
What is the difference in the loss rate caused by a single chip?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
The one on the left is a SEM, a optical chip.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
The SEM of the light path inside

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
The light is transmitted in these so-called light path lines.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
When we cut this straight waveguide,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
In the cross-sectional area,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
We see such a material distribution.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
For example, in this paper,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The material of the light path is a single-chip.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Below it is a low-resolution,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
That is, the two-chip is the material below it.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It's all air.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So if you cut a chip,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
You can see its index.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Its resolution distribution is actually a step thing.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Under these boundary conditions,

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Our Maxwell's equation will actually degenerate into an eigenvalue problem.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Its solution is Lissan.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Then this solution is our so-called waveguiding mode.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Its solution basically looks like this.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
That's different from the plane wave.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Waveguiding mode,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
It is defined by an equivalent resolution.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Its equivalent resolution is somewhere between the low-resolution and the high-resolution.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Then its field shape is basically a certain rule.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Its peak value is a semi-wavelength.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Can fit in this index.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Then its peak value is probably in the middle.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Then we can change this light path.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Our so-called waveguiding.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Its light path, its interface,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We can engineer its mode.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
For example, we can have this.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
A little wider,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
We can now fit in three modes.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
For example, there are several more than just now.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
So we just need to be able to master this light path.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Its basic design,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
For example, its material,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Its index gap,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
The gap between light and snow,

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
The gap between light and snow,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
And its size.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
We can design different photonic devices,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Photonic components.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
In this talk,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I want to introduce a few photonic components.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
First of all, this is what I just said.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
If we use a single mode,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
A single light path that can only support one mode.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
We trigger a light path that can support multiple modes.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This light path is relatively fat.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Then I can trigger many waveguiding modes at the same time.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Then they will interfere.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
This interference pattern can be accurately predicted.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
For example, this is a very standard light path.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
If we cut off this relatively thick wave at the right length,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
We can make a light path.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
This is a light path.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
This is a light path.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
This is a light path.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Then,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Then,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
This is a light path.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
This is a light path.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Then we are a 1x3 light path.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Then we have a single mode,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
We set up two mirrors.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Partially mirrored, or 100%.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It can form a cavity.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
This is a cavity.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
If we add some photonic components to this cavity,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That is to say, it provides gain.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Then you can compensate for the loss of the entire cavity.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Under the right conditions,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It will form our so-called photoreceptor.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This is our laser.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
What about this curve?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
One by one,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It actually reflects that

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
All that can be seen in this photoreceptor

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
It forms a whole number of waves.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
The wave field.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
This is our so-called magnet.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Longitudinal mode.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
This is the magnet.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
It mainly emits light.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
These wave fields.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Of course, we can also put a single-core

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Single-core single-mode waveguide.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
We use a more complicated loop to make it into a filter.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
The first filter is our so-called Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
In addition,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
You can also make it into a circular photoreceptor.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That is to say, the light hit in here.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
The light coming out of here can also have a filter effect.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Its transfer function is a very classic sine wave.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It is a sine wave.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
From 0% to 8%.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
That environment.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Its transfer function is a sharp thing.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Because it needs to achieve a resonance in the middle.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
So its frequency selection is very large.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
It is very fine.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
But at the same time, it is also difficult to reach 100%.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
In these devices that are used to form resonance in the future.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Whether it's a cavity or a filter.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
The distance between our resonance points.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Basically, it depends on the size of our feature layer.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
For example, in this cavity.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Laser cavity.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
The distance between these grids.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It's actually very different from the resonance field.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And in Mach-Zehnder's interferometer.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
In the middle of these resonance points.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It's the length that comes out of this.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It's also inverted.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
In the same way.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The distance between these two resonance points.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
And the radius of this transverse resonator.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That is to say, its wavelength is inverted.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
These devices with resonance features.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Of course, after we do it.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
After we realize it.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It must be different from what we expected at the time.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Because there will be various errors in the process.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So we may have to add some.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Our so-called phase tuner.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
We can use.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Substantially change this.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
The detection coefficient on a certain waveguide.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
For example, heating.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Substantial heating.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Or adding a power plant.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Or adding current.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Turn off the current.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
To stimulate these electron hole pairs.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
We can change its optical detection rate.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
And then we can.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Put these.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
We used to miss the resonance points.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Move it to where we want it to be.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
So basically.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
As long as you are familiar with these components.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You can build a more complex system.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
If you have any ideas.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
You can use some well-known components to build it.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm going to talk about it now.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The first example I want to introduce to you.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Is this.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Ah.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
We are on the single-conductive material.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
There is also a single-conductive.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Integrated platform.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
They made it.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
The platform.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I will do a demonstration with him later.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
That.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Ah.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Is.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
In fact.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
It's a single-conductive material.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
It's not a multi-conductive material.

16:05.000 --> 16:15.000
This one.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
You decide.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
The idea is that the two juices are theoretically exactly the same.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And when they launch, they will have a very uniform shape.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
It's just optical.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
It's just the shape of the frequency of this optical controversy.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Ah.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
So you see every line.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
They actually don't have a lot of energy.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
But if we listen to the laser, we are in this.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
This one.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Every product is inserted into a optical filter.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Ah.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
This optical filter can be controlled by external signals.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
For example.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Ah.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
This is our so-called light barrier.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Then he can.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
He can only choose one laser model.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
He suppresses other laser models.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
So when he has a shock radiation, he is a single-mole laser.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
And he has a very strong one.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Ah.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
This is a well-defined mode.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Only his power is obviously a lot bigger than that.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
So what kind of applications does he have?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
He's the first one.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
It can be used in gas.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Ah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Ah.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
My class.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
It's optical.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Optical.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
It can be used to track a certain party.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Or in the sound optical field.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
He can do it.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
The part of the body.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Then his light transmission is also a more traditional application.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Ah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
For example.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Hong Kong communication.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Or the same tone communication.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
It's all a main force.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
That's a new one.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Hong Kong is introducing to you.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
The frequency-continuous wave light radar.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
This.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
He still has.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
The main force is.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
He is.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
The main light source of the frequency-continuous wave.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
That.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
And.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Color.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Military Wave.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
The frequency generation.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
It's also called Tunable Laser.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
That.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Tunable Laser.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
What is his main metric?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
What are his main parameters?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
For example.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
The most classic one.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I just introduced to you.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
It's a.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Ah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
One.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
The back side is replaced by a light bomb.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
That light bomb.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
After you put the current in it.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
His index will change.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
That is, the light bomb.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
His.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
His.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
The black weapon in the middle.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
His.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
His maximum reflectivity.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
The wave field can be.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Because.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Add current.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
And then control.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
That he.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
That laser.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
After the shock radiation.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
His laser spectrum.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It basically looks like this.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Ah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Until that one.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
He's a single mass.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
My.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
His laser.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Why doesn't look like this?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Top wind with this second wind.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Power in the middle.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.020
The difference is a 40 bibi, which is our so-called Punk wants.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.000
He's al.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
The mainstream wind and the wind.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
The igen they stand between each other.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
10 to 10.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
It's in the BB.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
For the second.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
The second.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Who the hell is the parameter?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
What is the original parameter?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm going to say.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
So much.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
When he continues.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
In the case of continuous power supply.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
He can.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
He can.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
He has a total of his weapons that can be adjusted.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
How much?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Of course, his output power is also a main measurement goal.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Milliwatt or dbm to show.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
And his efficiency.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
For example, his.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
How much power do you put in?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
How much power does it give you?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Such a conversion efficiency.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
It's a line with.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This is our frequency.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Accuracy.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Then it's because of the client.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
A little better.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
If it's a little worse, it's basically this number.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
What if it's like this example?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
This traditional dbm laser.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
He only has one.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Ah.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
In the case of a filter.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The most we do is adjust 5 to 6 nanometers.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
This is a material limit.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
So how do we get tens of nanometers?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Or like the example I just did.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
More than 100 nanometers of tuning.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
We mainly have two means.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
This can be achieved.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
This is the so-called white ability.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
The first one is to use.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Ah, but it's a pair.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
That is to say, we are using a pair.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
This is the structure.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
For example, the circular oscillator or the light.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Ah, light.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
This kind of explosion.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
As long as you are a pair, you can do this.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
What does that mean?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
This example is that we have two circular oscillators.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
His.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
The environment is different.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
What about when the environment is different?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
He's this.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Between the two points of resonance.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
We have the so-called Fritz.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Fsr.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
It's different.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
For example, the green ring.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
He.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
We can see the green ring and the orange ring.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
It's a little different.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So it leads to the two of them.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
When they are together.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Only in their ally.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
This place.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
130 nanometers.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
His transmission is the highest.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Then when you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Ah.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
In the middle of this green ring.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Add an object.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
After a three-dimensional movement.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
He can move a little bit.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Just move a little bit.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
But their.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
The second overlapping place is directly from 130 to 1290 nanometers.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
So he's just.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
You just have to move about 1 to 2 nanometers.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
The wind.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
What about your overall score?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
You can jump ten times.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
This is what we call the so-called oil marker effect.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I've used oil markers.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
They all know that there are two degrees above.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
They are a little bit away.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
This is what they are.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
You move one of them a little bit.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
The next time they come.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It's very far away.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Then this.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
His.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Ah.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
His second feature.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
It's just that he's got a very small.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
This.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
This.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Ah.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
He can make a big one for you.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Frequency jump.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Another feature.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
It's usually this kind of parallel structure.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
His role is relatively sharp.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
In other words, his filter works very well.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
But he's another semi-permanent.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
One of the more significant shortcomings is that he's more.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Because.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
He is a result.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
So he.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Two small things into one.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
He's getting smaller and smaller.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
When you connect more and more.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
He's getting bigger and bigger.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
For example, you can see him.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
From 80% to 64%.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
That's another way.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Just use light interference.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
That's what we just said.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
A single color.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
That's under this architecture.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
We're just going to cut the structure in half.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And then add the mirror directly.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
We all know this.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
This mirror image.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
It can be used as a single color.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
His.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
His transfer function.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
That's the classic.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Then as long as one of the.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
100% reflection.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
That.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
He's a continuous tuning.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
That's what he.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It's the type of thing that jumps.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
He is.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
He's moving as much as you add.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
How much.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
But it should.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
He's not like this.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
He's not like this.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
The more you wear, the more he loses.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Uh, but his shortcomings.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
It's also obvious that his role is slower.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's just that he's particularly close to this.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
The top of the three-way.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
So his.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Uh.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Frequency selection.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
It's not as good as this one.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know if it's so good.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Whether it's an effect.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
That's the kind of resonance.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Whether it's a resonance or this interference.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
This kind of component.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
He.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
We've seen it.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
He can be used.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Uh.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
It can be adjusted.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It's a price.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
For example.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
On the single-fingered.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
He is.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It's already reached a commodity level.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
A parameter.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
It can be adjusted.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
For example.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
There's a front light.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Backlight.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
There's a layer of light in the middle.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
There's an external magnifier on the outside.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
At the same time.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
To magnify.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Uh.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
It's used to magnify light.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
His.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Range.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
It can be adjusted.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
About 40 nanometers.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
His.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
It's the wind.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
If you press the wind.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
About 50 db.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
It's 100,000 times the pressure.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Uh.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
It's already at 100.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But in the case of an external magnifier.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It can be up to 40.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Uh.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Uh.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
This is a commodity scale.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
A parameter.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
That.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Next is.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
On the second.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
The platform will be introduced to you later.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
On the silicon.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
We.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Already.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Humans have made countless nanometers.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
More than 50.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Uh.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
db.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
SMSR.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
And then.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It's less than 100.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Because he doesn't have an external magnifier.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
In fact, he.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Uh.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Nine.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
It's still relative.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
A more.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Uh.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
A power level.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
That.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
In this.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Light.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Light interference.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
The method.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
In.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Most of the time.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
It's in the single-finger.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
They make monolithic.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
A little.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
That's it.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
It's three.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Really.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Stuck together.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
That.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
It can be up to 74 nanometers.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
You.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Uh.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
At the same time.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
About 40 db.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Or more.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
A little bit.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Uh.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Power is relatively low.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
He only has one.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
That's it.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
This example.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
He's this year.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
He just came out last year.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
He's eight.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Uh.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
More.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
More extreme.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
A means.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
He has eight.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Mzi.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
8.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
The interference.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
He's a total of 45 nanometers.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Uh.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
50 db.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
SMSR.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
His language.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
It's also down to 160.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Uh.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Power is also better than the previous one.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
50.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Uh.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
About five.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
But.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
You can see that they are involved.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
They use a lot of filters.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Compared to this.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
This kind of use.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Uh.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
They need more filters.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
To reach this level.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
40 or 50 db.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
So we can see it very intuitively.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
His control is how you want to go.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
It's actually quite a challenge.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
What about this filter design?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
In this example, you can see this.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Light filter.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
His design.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
It directly affects your laser performance.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
This is very obvious.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Then in 2011.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Ah.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Please say.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Oh.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
This is the language here.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
What is the laser language?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Uh.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
What do you mean?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Uh.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
That is.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
That is.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
These languages are.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Uh.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
He is.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Oh.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Intrinsic language.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Is it related to his laser.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Is it related to the gun?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Or with.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Right.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
He is.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
He is.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Intrinsic.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
That's right.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
You remember very well.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
He is.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
It's related to the gun.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Uh.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
If.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
For.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Uh.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Laser.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
He is more.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Just.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I have prepared a more.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Uh.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
A more graphic slide.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
What is his language?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
He's actually laser.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
His.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
He's tired to death.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
When he turned his body around.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
He's actually.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Especially the semiconductor laser.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
He's in his background.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
In fact, there is a very weak.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
It's his.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Uh.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Self-radiation.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
It's just that he hasn't reached the water.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
The thing that happened before.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It's the LED thing.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Uh.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
When it reaches the water.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
He's going to have a very clear one.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Uh.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
The mechanism of radio radiation.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
But.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And then this is my.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Put this.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
The expression of that.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
It's his.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Instantaneous.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
The electric field inside the laser.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
His face.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
When the radiation occurs.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
There will be a very large amount.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
To show that he was the radiation field.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But on top of this.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's because he's got a lot of background.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Uh.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Self-radiation.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
So he's got this.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
He has a very weak one.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
A very small amount.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
He has.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
He.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
It's riding on this.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
This.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
On top of the mobile radiation.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
His lungs are random.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
It should be said that he is.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So you can imagine.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
He's a very big amount.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
He's actually got a very small thing on top of it.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
So he's actually shaking.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
He's not.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's not a very clear one.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
He's got a distribution.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
He's got a distribution.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
That's what we call the face.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
The face is not accurate.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
In fact, it is this.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
His.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
His.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
His performance.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
They're only missing a factor in the middle.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
That's right.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
This.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Live with him.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
The main thing is your gun.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The longer the laser is, the longer the gun is.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Your language can be lower.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
But the longer the gun is.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
It's also.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It's also equivalent to your laser.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Between the captain mode.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
It's getting narrower.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
If it's getting narrower.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
If it's getting narrower, it's testing the design of your filter.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
How to make this laser.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
In.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Maintaining a single film.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Uh, it's harder to launch.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
So, in order to normalize the gun, it's still.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
This is a blow.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I understand.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Thank you.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Right.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
That.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
So we're in.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Uh, so.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
We're in 2017.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
When I was in the post office, we proposed a new architecture.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
We call it the three X.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
It's actually also part of this kind of light.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Light sensor system.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
A filter effect.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
So, he actually, we're talking about Bell Labs.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
In 1990, he did the Y-Laser.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
At the time, they had two branches.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
That's the only one.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
That's what we call the.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Uh, the sensor.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So his.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
The SMSR is relatively low.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
The top of his side wave is very smooth.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
He only has 100 times the 20 dB.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Uh, his tuning range is also relatively small.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Only 8 nanometers.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
But we.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Uh, based on theoretical calculations, we found that as long as you add the third R.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
The third branch.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
That's equivalent to the two of us.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
It's equivalent to the shortest one.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
This one.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We have two.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
They each represent a very wide FSR and a very narrow FSR.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Uh, through this, uh, mechanism, we can introduce two.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
The interference pattern of the front wave.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
We can.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Max, we can design this tuning range separately.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
With him.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Improve his SMSR.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
To achieve a, uh.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Basically, it can decouple these two parameters.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I want to be on the Y-Laser.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
These two parameters are always.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Uh, hand in hand.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You want SMSR high.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
This is.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Intrinsic.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Mathematically, it's such a.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Uh, a reality.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
What kind of structure does that 3X laser have?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
This is a good explanation for everyone.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
This is.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Uh, their transfer function.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
If this is the Y-Laser.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It's the front wave we just saw.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
But if there's a 3X, we add the second front wave.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
We're naturally on the outside.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
We're still the same as the Y-Laser.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
But in essence.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
In this.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
We have the second.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Interference.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
That is, we can.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
We can.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
We can take this.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
It used to be very smooth.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The front wave has become very sharp.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Uh, further filter.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I don't want to.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I don't want to filter.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
I don't want to.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
If we're going to calculate it.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
If you don't, you'll find this Y-Laser.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
It's actually very dense at the top.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That is to say.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
These modes.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
It's actually with the main model.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
That's what we want.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
150 nanometers.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
They're very close.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
They're very close.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
So, uh.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
But if you add.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Like, if we add the third branch.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
We can filter out a lot.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
I don't want to.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
You see, we only have about four or five left.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And they're with the main model.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
There's a certain gap between their hands.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
So we can.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
So, uh.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Uh.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Uh.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Uh.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Uh.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Uh.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Uh.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Uh.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Uh.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Uh.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Uh.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Uh.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Uh.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Uh.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Uh.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Uh.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Uh.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Uh.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Uh.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Uh.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Uh.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Uh.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Uh.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Uh.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Uh.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Uh.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Uh.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Uh.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Uh.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Uh.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Uh.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Uh.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Uh.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Uh.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Uh.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Okay.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
I'll tried.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
One.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I back.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
And I kicked.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
My body.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Just.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Uh.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Uh.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Uh.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000

51:52.000 --> 52:12.000
Uh.

52:12.000 --> 52:22.000
Uh.

52:22.000 --> 52:32.000
Uh.

52:32.000 --> 52:42.000
Uh.

52:42.000 --> 52:52.000
Uh.

52:52.000 --> 53:02.000
Uh.

53:02.000 --> 53:12.000
Uh.

53:12.000 --> 53:32.000
Uh.

53:32.000 --> 53:42.000
Uh.

53:42.000 --> 53:52.000
Uh.

53:52.000 --> 54:02.000
Uh.

54:02.000 --> 54:12.000
Uh.

54:12.000 --> 54:22.000
Uh.

54:22.000 --> 54:32.000
Uh.

54:32.000 --> 54:42.000
Uh.

54:42.000 --> 54:52.000
Uh.

54:52.000 --> 55:12.000
Uh.

55:12.000 --> 55:32.000
Uh.

55:32.000 --> 55:52.000
Uh.

55:52.000 --> 56:02.000
Uh.

56:02.000 --> 56:12.000
Uh.

56:12.000 --> 56:32.000
Uh.

56:32.000 --> 56:42.000
Uh.

56:42.000 --> 56:52.000
Uh.

56:52.000 --> 57:12.000
Uh.

57:12.000 --> 57:32.000
Uh.

57:32.000 --> 57:52.000
Uh.

57:52.000 --> 58:12.000
Uh.

58:12.000 --> 58:32.000
Uh.

58:32.000 --> 58:52.000
Uh.

58:52.000 --> 59:12.000
Uh.

59:12.000 --> 59:32.000
Uh.

59:32.000 --> 59:42.000
Uh.

59:42.000 --> 59:52.000
Uh.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Uh.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Uh.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Uh.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Uh.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Uh.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Uh.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Uh.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Uh.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Uh.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Uh.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Uh.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Uh.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Uh.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Uh.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Uh.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Uh.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Uh.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Uh.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Uh.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Uh.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Uh.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Okay, okay, thank you.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Uh.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Uh.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Uh.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Uh.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Uh.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Uh.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Uh.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Uh.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Uh.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Oh, thank you.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Um.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Uh, I, I have a question here.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Uh.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Uh.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Uh.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So this is what we call a jump.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Uh, jump filter mode.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
What I just said is a jump.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Uh.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Uh.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Of course, he's testing.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
It's very obvious that you can see it when you're testing.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000
For example, we can see that he has a middle jump here.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
He jumped again.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Jumped again.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
This is basically a jump.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Jump.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Uh, that's it.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You can also see this.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Every step.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
That if it is.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
If it's a laser, he'll jump this.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Uh, filter mode.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Yeah, that's it.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Is there any application of this?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
At present.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Uh, I haven't used it yet.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
In fact, people hate this thing.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It's because of the time.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
That represents him.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Physically, he represents two.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
He competes with the carrier.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
When it's the most intense, it's the same input current.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
There are these two.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
He's giving you at the same time.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Grab this resource.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
That is, he was at that time.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Uh, noise is the biggest.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So everyone hates this thing happening.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Well, there's no way.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
This is physics.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
There's no way.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Uh huh.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But all of them.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
With that kind of micro ring.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Will there be this problem?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yes, all of them.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
As long as there is a filter.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He will have this problem.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Uh, the most frequent.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Uh, if the L I is.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Uh, there is no filter.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
As long as there is a filter, he will be like this.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Of course, he can play very high power.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But he is always multi mode.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
There is no way.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Don't worry.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Um.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Or use DFV.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
DFV is a single product.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Then he.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Uh, there won't be.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
This problem of motor.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Uh huh.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Hey, ask him.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
His mother.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
His.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Hey, can you give me some numbers?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I can't see it here.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
He's probably.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
How much frequency is this?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Uh, I think.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
OK.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Oh, it's okay.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Hey, I want to ask another question.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Hey, a little bit.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
His.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You have a character.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
What is his?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Uh, relaxation.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Is the frequency of the selection?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Oh, we don't have it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Because of this platform.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
We are.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Uh, more.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
We are a foreign package.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
This is the Netherlands.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Uh.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But you can guess very well.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
He is in the middle of 1 gigahertz to 3 gigahertz.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
He is not.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
He is not.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So, of course, this level.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
OK.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Thank you.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Correct.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
But he has something to do with his resonance gun length.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
The longer your resonance gun is, the slower it is.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Correct.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
OK.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Well, if not.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Then I will end this recording here first.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Thank you all.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Thank you.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Thank you.
