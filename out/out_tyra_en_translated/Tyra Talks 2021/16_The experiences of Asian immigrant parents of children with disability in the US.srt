1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First of all, I'm Kao Hsien. I'm a Ph.D. student from the University of Brisbane.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm very happy to be able to invite Yiting to talk about today's topic.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In 2019, Yiting received a Ph.D. from Boston University in the field of Rehabilitation Science.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since last year, 2020, she has been a Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Behavior and Community Science.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
During her university and master's degree, she studied in the Department of Cognitive Immunotherapy and the Cognitive Immunotherapy Research Institute.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She has worked in schools, clinics, hospitals, and other places for a long time, about four years.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She mainly serves children with mental disorders and their families.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Until now, her research interests include the communication of mental disorders, cross-cultural and parents' education experience,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and environmental factors affecting the health and quality of mental disorders and family members.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She is also currently involved in the study of COVID-19, the impact of this epidemic on our mental health,

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
as well as the study plan for the integration of mental patients into the care system.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's all for my introduction.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The floor is yours.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yiting, please start your report.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
First of all, I'd like to thank Yiting for taking the time to prepare so many things for us,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
as well as some preliminary communication.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Also, I'd like to thank the T-Rod platform for allowing us to participate in this event on the weekend.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'd like to thank everyone for having the opportunity to listen to this presentation on the weekend.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's get started.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Today's topic is,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it their country or our home?

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'd like to share the quote I got from this interview.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think it's a good way to show that as an immigrant living in a new country,

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
how does it affect the implementation of their family position in terms of identity?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How do they practice their family position?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My main target is the first generation of Asian immigrants in the United States.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Their children have different developmental disabilities.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Later, I will...

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Today's presentation...

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Today, I will talk about...

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It will take about 10 to 15 minutes.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will talk about my own experience,

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and why I want to do this topic now,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and what led me to get to where I am today step by step.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Next, I will talk about the two studies I want to share today.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
These two studies are from my doctoral thesis.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will talk about the background of these two studies.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Next, I will talk about the first study I did.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a meta-synthesis study.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know if you are familiar with this type of study.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I will talk about what it is,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and how I use it.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Lastly, I will talk about a more traditional implementation study.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will talk about how parents in the U.S.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
help their children with developmental disabilities

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
in the U.S.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and how they arrange their adult life.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
At the end of this talk,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we will move on to today's Q&A.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you have any questions,

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you can leave them in the chat box.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you have any questions,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you can leave them in the chat box.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can also leave them in the chat box during the Q&A.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The first question is,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
as Kou said,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
my university and master's degree are both in Chengda University.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They are all in Cognitive Therapy.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Regarding Cognitive Therapy,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think most people have heard about it.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will take this opportunity

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to give you a brief explanation of Cognitive Therapy.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think a lot of people

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
will take Occupational Therapy

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
as a direct approach.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think a lot of people

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
will take Occupational Therapy

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
as a direct approach.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Occupational therapy is not an Job.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This term, Occupational Therapy,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
is not a job-related word

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but a meaningful activity to everyone.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This term, occupational therapy,

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is important to people of different age groups.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
For example,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
if I'm a doctor or a worker,

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
meaningful activities to me

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
are going to work, doing research,

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
going to class, and so on.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If I'm in a normal workplace,

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
due to physiological, psychological,

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
or other reasons,

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't go to work,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
meaningful activities to me

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
are going to work.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Occupational therapy

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is also for people

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
who can't go to work.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For example,

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it's for workers

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
who need to evaluate their functions

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
or help them with their arms

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
or other body functions.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Occupational therapy

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
also helps them adjust

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
their work environment

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so that they can go back to work.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
For children,

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
meaningful activities to them

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
are playing,

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
socializing with others,

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
going to school,

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
or even daily life management.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Can they do these things?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
These are meaningful activities to them.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
At this point,

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'd like to talk about

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the scope of occupational therapy.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's widely defined in our field.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
However,

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
people who are not in this field

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
may not have a clear understanding

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
of this term.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It may be more defined as

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
occupational therapy.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
As occupational therapists,

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
there are two ways

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to help our clients.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We care about

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the three circles

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
in the lower right corner.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We care about

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
whether the person,

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the environment,

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and the occupation

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
can overlap well

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and whether the person

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
can do meaningful things

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
in their daily life.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In addition to

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
personal adjustment,

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we may also adjust

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the environment.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We may also

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
help the person

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to adjust

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
meaningful activities

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
so that they can do

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what they want to do

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but may need

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
a new way

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
or a new schedule.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's the concept

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
of occupational therapy.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In Taiwan,

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
once you graduate as an occupational therapist,

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you can get a national license

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to work as

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
an occupational therapist.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When I graduated from college,

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I went to a vocational school

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and worked as

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
an occupational therapist.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I mainly did early therapy.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Early therapy may be defined

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
as before the age of three

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
or six.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Later, I did rehabilitation

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
for children who were

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
in the early stages of learning.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Later,

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
after I graduated from college,

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I did other occupational therapies

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in Taipei and Tainan.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For example,

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I worked as an occupational therapist

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in a school

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or in a traditional

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
rehabilitation center

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in a hospital.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I also had experience

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
interacting with patients

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
as an adult.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I also worked

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
in a nursing center

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
as an occupational therapist.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I also had experience

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
interacting with patients

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
as an adult.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I mainly worked with

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
children with mental disabilities

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and their families.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
At that time,

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
when I was working in Taipei,

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
we had a non-official

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
parent support group.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In Taiwan,

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
under the health insurance system,

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
hospitals usually provide

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
one-on-one

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
or group therapy

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to children.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
As a therapist,

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
it is quite common

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
to see children

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
come to you

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
once a week

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
for 30 minutes

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
or even an hour.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It may be a little more than that,

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but that's about it.

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We can recognize

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that if we can

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
make a long-term

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
or effective change

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
in their daily lives,

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
it is a very important step

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
because parents spend

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
most of their time

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
interacting with their children.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Parents know their children's

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
strengths and weaknesses,

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
preferences,

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and where they need to improve.

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
At that time,

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
we started

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the parent support group.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
In fact,

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
parents have a lot of

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
interesting motivation to develop.

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Here is a simple example.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
For example,

227
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
a parent wants

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
her child to help

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
her child practice

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
taking a bath.

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Does the child's

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
bathroom need some adjustments?

233
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Does the child need

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to practice

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
taking a bath?

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
However,

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
another parent

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
heard our discussion

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
in the group.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Her child is already

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
in the third grade,

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
but she did not realize

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that children can

244
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
practice taking a bath.

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
She heard this

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
through this chat

247
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and then came to

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
discuss with us

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and found that

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
this is one of the goals

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
she and her child

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
want to achieve.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So we started to

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
discuss with her.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In my experience,

256
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
most of the time

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
parents only

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
have one or two children.

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They may not have

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
many opportunities

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to interact with other parents.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
However,

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
when we set up

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
this group,

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
there were not many

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
relevant evidences

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
about how to

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
effectively provide

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
this kind of

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
parent support group

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in our field.

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is why

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was interested

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in reading the

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
doctor's class

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to find out

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
how to

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
develop an

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
evidence-based

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
support group

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
for our clients.

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I need to know

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
what I need to know

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and what research

285
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I need to do

286
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in order to

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
know whether

288
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
my intervention

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
is effective or not.

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So in 2014

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and 2019,

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I joined

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Youth and Young Adult

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Empowerment, Leadership,

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and Learning.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We focus on

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
young adults with

298
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
mental disabilities

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
between 14 and

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
20 years old.

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They are not like

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
me when I was in Taiwan.

303
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was in primary school.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There are relatively

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
few people in Taiwan

306
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
with disabilities.

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Through the experience

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
of the doctor's class,

309
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I had the opportunity

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to learn more about

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
young adults.

312
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This influenced

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
my understanding

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
of the age group

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
in my doctoral thesis.

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My interests

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
in this research

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
are those

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
related to

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
education and

321
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
immigration.

322
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm also interested

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in cross-cultural experiences.

324
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I hope that

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
my research and

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
future research

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
will be in the same

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
field.

329
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
In 2020,

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I started

331
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
my research

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
called

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Health Behavior and

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Behavior.

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My research

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is related to

337
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
suicide and

338
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
mental illness.

339
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
My current boss

340
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is also doing

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
qualitative research

342
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and quantitative research.

343
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I hope that

344
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
my research can

345
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
help patients

346
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
with mental illness.

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Through this opportunity,

348
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I hope that

349
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
my research can

350
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
help patients

351
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
with mental illness.

352
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Next,

353
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will talk about

354
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the two research

355
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I mentioned today.

356
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
First,

357
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think parental involvement

358
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is important.

359
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Some people

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
may be involved

361
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
from the perspective of

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
their brothers and sisters.

363
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Some people

364
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
may be involved

365
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
from the perspective

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
of their teachers

367
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
such as

368
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
doctors

369
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and so on.

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm interested in

371
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the same thing

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I mentioned earlier.

373
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm interested in

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the same thing

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
such as

376
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
parent involvement

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
that can lead to

378
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
positive effects

379
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
in the child's

380
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
social, emotional,

381
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and functional outcomes.

382
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Developmental disabilities

383
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
happened

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
when the child was

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
18 years old.

386
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So it happened

387
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
quite early

388
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and affected

389
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the child for a long time.

390
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You may

391
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
hear of

392
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
intellectual disability

393
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
or autism

394
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
or hearing loss

395
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
or mental illness

396
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and so on.

397
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
These are the so-called

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
developmental disabilities.

399
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Simply put,

400
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
according to

401
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
my research in the U.S.,

402
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
there is

403
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
a law

404
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
on the right

405
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to learn

406
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
for people with

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
mental disabilities

408
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
called

409
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Individuals with Disabilities

410
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Education Improvement Act,

411
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
or IDEA.

412
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The law

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
ensures that

414
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
people with disabilities

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
can access

416
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the resources

417
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
they need

418
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
at their local

419
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
public schools

420
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or private schools.

421
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The law

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
clearly states

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that parents

424
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
have the right

425
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to participate

426
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in the child's education.

427
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
For example,

428
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
if the child's

429
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
private education

430
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is related to

431
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
the child's

432
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
private education,

433
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
parents need to

434
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
participate.

435
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Of course,

436
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it's a different matter

437
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
whether parents can

438
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
participate,

439
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
but the school

440
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
must provide

441
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the platform

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
for the child

443
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to learn.

444
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The number of

445
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Asian immigrants

446
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
in the U.S.

447
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
grew rapidly

448
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
from more than

449
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
2 million in 1980

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
to more than 12 million

451
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
in 2014.

452
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The number

453
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
increased rapidly

454
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
in 2021.

455
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In the past,

456
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the number

457
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
of Asian immigrants

458
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
in the U.S.

459
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
was estimated

460
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
to exceed

461
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the number of

462
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hispanic immigrants

463
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
in 2025.

464
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So,

465
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the number

466
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
of Asian immigrants

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
in the U.S.

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
grew rapidly

469
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and parents

470
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
couldn't provide

471
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the appropriate services

472
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
for their children.

473
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So,

474
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
if we

475
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
don't have

476
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the appropriate

477
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
understanding of

478
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the population,

479
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
there will be

480
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
some difficulties

481
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
in the service.

482
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In the past,

483
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
when Asian parents

484
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
received education-related services,

485
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
they encountered

486
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
more obstacles.

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
For example,

488
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
they started

489
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to receive services

490
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
later than others,

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
or they spent

492
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
less time

493
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
in the education process

494
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
than others,

495
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
etc.

496
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
In the past,

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the cultural difference

498
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
between Asian and

499
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hispanic parents

500
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
was reduced.

501
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So,

502
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
if we eliminate

503
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
the cultural difference,

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
will the obstacles

505
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
disappear naturally?

506
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But is there

507
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
a day when

508
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
there is no cultural difference?

509
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is a question

510
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
worth thinking about.

511
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In the past,

512
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Asian parents

513
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
rarely faced

514
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
the barriers

515
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
they encountered.

516
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So,

517
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
why did they

518
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
choose these methods?

519
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So,

520
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
here are some

521
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
knowledge gaps in the past.

522
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
First,

523
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
they focused on barriers.

524
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Second,

525
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
these barriers

526
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
are only related to service providers.

527
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
In fact,

528
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
there are many things

529
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
in people's lives.

530
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
As I said in the beginning,

531
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the interaction with service providers

532
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
is important.

533
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
However,

534
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
there are many other things

535
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and times in people's lives.

536
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
In the past,

537
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
they focused on

538
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
young children.

539
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So,

540
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in the past,

541
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
they focused on

542
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
young children

543
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
before high school

544
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
or high school.

545
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
In the past,

546
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
they focused on

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
what they wanted to do

548
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and how to achieve

549
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
their goals.

550
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
In the past,

551
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
immigration is

552
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
a process

553
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that changes

554
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
every day.

555
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not like

556
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you came to the US for 3 years

557
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
or Europe for 5 years

558
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and you achieved

559
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
cultural adaptation.

560
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In fact,

561
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you learn new things

562
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
every day.

563
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You have new understanding

564
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
of the country

565
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because of the interaction.

566
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You may be

567
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
culturally adapted

568
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
in the past.

569
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
However,

570
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
there is little research

571
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
about the changes

572
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
in the process of

573
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
cultural adaptation.

574
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
For example,

575
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
the first basic thing

576
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
is the ability to speak.

577
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
As you stay in the US

578
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
or abroad longer,

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
your ability to speak may change.

580
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Then,

581
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
your understanding of

582
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
cultural adaptation may improve.

583
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Next,

584
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you need to understand

585
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the concept of mental disability.

586
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This concept may come from

587
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
your country or your values.

588
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Your values may be affected

589
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
by the environment

590
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
or the mainstream

591
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
of society.

592
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Next,

593
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
when you're a parent,

594
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
you don't know

595
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
what you want to do.

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Many people say

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
they learned

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
how to be a parent

599
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
by being a parent.

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
In fact,

601
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
there are many changes

602
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
in the process of

603
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
mental disability.

604
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
However,

605
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
there is little research about it.

606
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
In my research,

607
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I want to use

608
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
role theory and acculturation theory

609
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
as my theoretical background.

610
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
In the first part,

611
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the role theory says

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the role of a parent

613
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
is related to

614
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the behavior

615
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
of the child.

616
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
However,

617
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the behavior of the child

618
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
may be different

619
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
from the behavior

620
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
of the society.

621
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It may affect

622
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the role of the child.

623
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There may be different adjustments.

624
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Next,

625
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
we know

626
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the role of a parent

627
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
is related to

628
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the society.

629
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If we want to understand immigrants,

630
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
we need to consider

631
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
their cultural background

632
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to see if it

633
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
affects their

634
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
beliefs

635
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and behaviors.

636
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think

637
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
this part is very simple.

638
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
We want to know

639
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
how the parents

640
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
in the U.S.

641
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
help their children

642
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to find resources

643
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
or use resources.

644
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What are their experiences?

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I will introduce

646
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
these two researches one by one.

647
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Through these two researches,

648
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I want to respond to

649
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the biggest goal.

650
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Next,

651
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
let's talk about

652
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
meta-analysis.

653
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I want to explain

654
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
what is meta-analysis.

655
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I think you often hear

656
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
about meta-analysis.

657
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It is a systematic review

658
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and systematic analysis.

659
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Meta-analysis is

660
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
about qualitative research.

661
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Meta-analysis is

662
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
about quantitative research.

663
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Meta-analysis is

664
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
about qualitative research.

665
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The data of qualitative research

666
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
comes from other researches

667
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
related to the topic

668
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
you are interested in.

669
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You can use the data

670
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
to make

671
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the second analysis.

672
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Meta-analysis is not

673
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
just about

674
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
organizing the researches

675
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
related to the topic

676
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
in the past.

677
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It emphasizes

678
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
that you need

679
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
a new interpretation

680
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
to explain the researches

681
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
related to the topic

682
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
you are interested in.

683
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The purpose of meta-analysis

684
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
is to put the qualitative researches

685
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
you have published

686
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
in the past

687
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
in a new perspective

688
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
to interpret them.

689
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
to interpret them.

690
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Through this way,

691
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
we can generate

692
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
theoretical frameworks.

693
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
These frameworks

694
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
can provide

695
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
new ideas

696
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
or new guidance

697
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
to future researches

698
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
or clinical work.

699
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
to future researches

700
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
or clinical work.

701
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Meta-analysis

702
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
was developed in 1997.

703
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Meta-analysis was developed in 1997.

704
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I just simply

705
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
selected PubMed as a database.

706
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Meta-analysis has been

707
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
developing step by step.

708
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't know if you have

709
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the chance to see

710
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
similar researches.

711
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If not,

712
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I believe there will be

713
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
more opportunities

714
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to see similar researches in the future.

715
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Some researches

716
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
develop meta-analysis

717
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and meta-synthesis

718
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
at the same time

719
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
in the same paper.

720
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Meta-analysis

721
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Meta-analysis

722
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Meta-analysis

723
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
aims to develop

724
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a theoretical framework

725
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
to describe

726
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
parents' experience

727
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
when accessing

728
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
or using

729
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
related services.

730
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This research

731
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
was published last year

732
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
in Qualitative Health Research.

733
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If you are interested,

734
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you can download it.

735
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you don't have access,

736
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I can provide full text.

737
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Meta-analysis

738
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Meta-analysis

739
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
is a systematic review.

740
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We develop

741
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
search terms

742
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and put them into different databases.

743
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We found

744
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
more than 800 articles.

745
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We included some inclusion criteria,

746
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
such as peer-reviewed articles

747
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
written in English,

748
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
samples,

749
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
subjects,

750
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and topics.

751
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We included

752
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
11 articles

753
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
in the 800 articles.

754
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The translation

755
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is based on

756
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the synthesis of 11 articles.

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There are

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
more than

759
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
170 parents

760
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
in Meta-analysis.

761
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It was published

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
in 1987,

763
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
more than 30 years ago.

764
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We published

765
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
9 articles

766
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
between 2000 and 2010.

767
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The frequency is not high.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The latest article was published in 2016.

769
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
However, the search

770
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
was checked again in 2020.

771
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Maybe there is a new article,

772
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
but we didn't include it.

773
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Most of the articles

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
were published

775
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
between 12 and 12 years old.

776
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
There are 7 articles

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
between 12 and 20 years old.

778
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Only one article

779
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
included an older child.

780
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
However,

781
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the topic was not

782
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
targeted at the child,

783
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
but the child was older.

784
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In the past,

785
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
most of the articles

786
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
were written in Korean,

787
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
some were in Chinese,

788
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and some were

789
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
combined samples

790
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
from Japan,

791
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
South Asia,

792
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
and other countries.

793
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
These articles

794
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
were mostly in-person interviews.

795
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Some were done

796
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
by phone interviews,

797
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and some were done

798
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
by other methods.

799
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It is worth mentioning

800
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that most of the articles

801
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
were done

802
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
in a short period of time.

803
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Especially,

804
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
if the interview

805
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
was a complicated one,

806
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and we only had

807
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
a 30-minute call

808
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
or an hour-long interview,

809
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the depth of the topic

810
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
was limited.

811
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It was a pity

812
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
for the research

813
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
in the past.

814
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Most of the articles

815
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
were published in the East Coast,

816
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the West Coast,

817
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and Chicago,

818
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
which is where

819
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Asian-Americans live.

820
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Now,

821
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
let's talk about

822
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
my research findings.

823
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
First,

824
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
we were curious

825
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
about the role of parents

826
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
in the process.

827
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
We analyzed

828
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that the main goal

829
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
of parents

830
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
is to help their children

831
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to grow up

832
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and live a happy life.

833
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The role

834
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
of parents

835
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is multifaceted.

836
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The role of parents

837
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
is multifaceted.

838
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The role of parents

839
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
is multifaceted.

840
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The role of parents

841
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
is multifaceted.

842
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It is the role of parents

843
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to help their children

844
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to plan their future.

845
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It is the role of parents

846
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to help their children

847
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
to plan their future.

848
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Many times,

849
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
other kids

850
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
don't have bruises.

851
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Even if they only have

852
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
one child,

853
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
they still have

854
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
some things

855
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
to do

856
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
such as

857
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
their parents.

858
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
These things are

859
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
related to each other.

860
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
For example,

861
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
this father said

862
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that he wanted to

863
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
buy a house

864
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
before he knew

865
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
about supportive living.

866
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Then he could help

867
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
his children to

868
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
run a group home.

869
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't know if you are familiar with

870
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
a group home.

871
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It is a type of living

872
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
where 4 to 6

873
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
or 3 to 6

874
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
adults with neurodegenerative disorder

875
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
can live in a

876
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
apartment.

877
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
However, the government

878
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
won't pay their rent.

879
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They may have a chance

880
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
to find a worker

881
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
who will come

882
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
once a day

883
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
to help them

884
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
with their daily life,

885
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
such as cooking

886
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
or washing clothes.

887
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It depends on

888
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
the needs of each group home.

889
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This father

890
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
later realized

891
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that he had

892
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
improved his knowledge

893
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
about supportive living.

894
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Otherwise,

895
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
he planned to

896
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
buy a house

897
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and run a group home.

898
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This quote shows

899
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
that these aspects

900
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
are related to each other.

901
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Next,

902
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
we are curious about

903
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the process

904
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
of the paternity.

905
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What does it look like?

906
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The first thing we see

907
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
is that it is

908
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
a continuous process.

909
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Usually, it does not

910
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
end in a circle.

911
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It may go on

912
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
until the parents

913
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
can't continue.

914
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Or the parents

915
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
have a clear plan

916
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
for their children's future.

917
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then it may

918
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
stop in this circle.

919
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Otherwise, it is

920
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
an endless cycle.

921
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
However, in each cycle,

922
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
they may experience

923
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
whether their plan

924
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
is successful.

925
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
If it is successful,

926
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
they may

927
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
achieve their goal.

928
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
However, if

929
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
their plan is not successful,

930
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
they may experience

931
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
dissatisfaction.

932
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They may face

933
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
dissatisfaction

934
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
through coping strategies.

935
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
This coping strategy

936
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
may influence

937
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
their next action.

938
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In this process,

939
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
we can see that

940
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the parents

941
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
change their

942
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
coping strategies

943
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
as time goes by.

944
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
For example,

945
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
they may decide

946
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
not to attend

947
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the meeting.

948
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The parents

949
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
may go to the meeting

950
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
at the beginning.

951
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
However, they may

952
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
change their

953
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
coping strategies

954
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
based on

955
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
their past

956
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
interactions

957
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
with the environment.

958
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In the case of

959
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
individual factors,

960
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
we can see that

961
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
there are several factors.

962
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
For example,

963
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
the age of the children

964
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
may influence

965
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
their actions.

966
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
In addition,

967
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
some parents

968
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
may know

969
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
how far they can go

970
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
based on their

971
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
rights as parents.

972
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
For example,

973
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
they may ask

974
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
for their rights.

975
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
This may influence

976
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
their next action.

977
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
In the case of

978
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Korean immigrants,

979
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
their parents may

980
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
say that

981
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
their parents

982
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
respect their

983
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
profession and rights

984
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
based on their

985
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
traditional culture.

986
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Therefore,

987
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
they may not

988
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
ask questions

989
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
because

990
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
their culture

991
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
is different from

992
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the education of

993
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
their native country.

994
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This may influence

995
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
their actions

996
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
In addition,

997
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
they may use

998
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
coping strategies

999
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
based on their

1000
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
past interactions

1001
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
with the environment.

1002
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
In the case of

1003
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
self-reliance,

1004
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
they may not

1005
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
rely on others

1006
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
to solve the problem

1007
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but rely on themselves.

1008
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Some people may

1009
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
look for resources

1010
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and coping strategies

1011
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
based on their

1012
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
past interactions

1013
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
with the environment.

1014
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
However,

1015
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
this does not mean

1016
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
they are self-reliant.

1017
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
They may just

1018
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
measure what happens

1019
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
in their life.

1020
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The best solution

1021
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
is to compromise.

1022
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It is also interesting

1023
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
to see how they

1024
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
respond to the

1025
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
expectations of

1026
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
immigrants.

1027
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
However,

1028
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
everyone has

1029
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
different expectations.

1030
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
For example,

1031
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
some parents

1032
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
have learned

1033
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
how to interact

1034
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
with their

1035
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
American parents.

1036
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Some parents

1037
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
may feel

1038
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that their country

1039
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
has given them

1040
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
a lot of resources

1041
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and they should

1042
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
be a good immigrant.

1043
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Therefore,

1044
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
everyone may have

1045
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
different expectations.

1046
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
These factors

1047
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
may influence

1048
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
their actions.

1049
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
In the process,

1050
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
many system factors

1051
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
may influence

1052
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
their behavior.

1053
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
For example,

1054
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
some parents

1055
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
may have

1056
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
specific guidelines

1057
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
or rules

1058
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
when interacting

1059
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
with their

1060
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
parents.

1061
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
For immigrants,

1062
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
social support

1063
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
is very important

1064
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
for all parents.

1065
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Especially for immigrants

1066
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
who interact

1067
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
with school or hospital

1068
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
based on their needs.

1069
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
For example,

1070
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
language accommodation

1071
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
is very important

1072
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
for immigrants.

1073
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It is important

1074
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
for immigrants

1075
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
to know

1076
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
if the information

1077
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
they provide

1078
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
is good

1079
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
or not.

1080
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
For example,

1081
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
if the information

1082
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
they provide

1083
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is good

1084
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
or not,

1085
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
they may feel

1086
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that the information

1087
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
they provide

1088
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is helpful.

1089
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
They may feel

1090
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that the information

1091
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
they provide

1092
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
is good

1093
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
or not.

1094
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
In the past,

1095
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
they may use

1096
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
the information

1097
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
their parents understand

1098
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to explain to their parents.

1099
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
In the process,

1100
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
they may feel

1101
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that their parents' opinion

1102
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is important

1103
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and they really

1104
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
want to hear

1105
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and value their parents' opinion.

1106
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They may feel

1107
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
that their parents

1108
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
are a support

1109
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and sometimes a barrier.

1110
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
They may feel that

1111
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the system factor

1112
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
needs to be considered.

1113
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
This is the first part

1114
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
of the study.

1115
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
There are several

1116
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
points of discussion.

1117
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We can see that

1118
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
their parents' role

1119
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
is very adaptive.

1120
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We can see that

1121
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
they use various coping strategies

1122
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
based on their cultural

1123
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
adaptation and experience.

1124
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
In fact,

1125
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
we can see that

1126
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
their role

1127
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
is not that different

1128
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
from those

1129
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
non-immigrant parents.

1130
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In fact,

1131
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
we can see that

1132
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
their role

1133
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
is not that different

1134
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
from those

1135
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
non-immigrant parents.

1136
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
As parents,

1137
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
no matter where you are,

1138
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
there is a lot of

1139
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
commonality.

1140
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
They are all parents in the U.S.

1141
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
so the environment

1142
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and the identity

1143
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
of being a parent

1144
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
may be similar

1145
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
when they face

1146
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
what they want to do.

1147
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
The problem is

1148
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that they have similar goals.

1149
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
However,

1150
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
their approach

1151
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
may be different.

1152
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We can compare

1153
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
past studies.

1154
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Some studies

1155
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
show that

1156
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
when parents advocate

1157
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
for their children

1158
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
or families,

1159
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
their parents

1160
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
tend to

1161
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
hope that

1162
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
they sound nice.

1163
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
In the U.S.,

1164
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
non-immigrant parents

1165
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
tend to say

1166
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
that they want to fight

1167
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
for their kids

1168
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in the process of

1169
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
advocating.

1170
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Of course,

1171
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
this is not true

1172
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
for everyone.

1173
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
However,

1174
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
we can learn from

1175
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
their experiences

1176
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
that

1177
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
their goal

1178
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
may be different

1179
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
when they face

1180
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
cultural background.

1181
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
After

1182
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
doing this meta-analysis,

1183
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
we found some

1184
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
limitations of past studies.

1185
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So we decided

1186
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
to conduct

1187
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
a qualitative study

1188
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to understand

1189
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
what I could not understand

1190
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in the previous meta-analysis.

1191
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
In this meta-analysis study,

1192
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
we found that

1193
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
adults

1194
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
had less experience

1195
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
than children,

1196
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
mostly before

1197
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
they left the special education system.

1198
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
By the way,

1199
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
in the U.S.,

1200
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the special education system

1201
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
is required to provide

1202
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
services to children

1203
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
before they graduate

1204
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
from high school

1205
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
or become

1206
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
22 years old.

1207
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
However,

1208
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
in the U.S.,

1209
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the special education system

1210
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
is not as perfect

1211
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
as in the U.S.

1212
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
when it comes to

1213
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
school regulations

1214
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and responsibilities.

1215
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
In the U.S.,

1216
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the special education system

1217
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
relies on parents

1218
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
to plan

1219
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
what to do

1220
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
in the future.

1221
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Even for

1222
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
non-immigrant families,

1223
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
it is difficult

1224
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
for them to transition

1225
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to adulthood.

1226
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Many researches

1227
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
suggest that

1228
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
it sounds easy,

1229
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
but it takes

1230
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
3 to 5 years

1231
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
for the parents

1232
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
to transition

1233
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to adulthood.

1234
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It is a challenge.

1235
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
In the past,

1236
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Asian immigrants

1237
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
were considered

1238
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
to be super big

1239
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
in Asia,

1240
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
including East Asia,

1241
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Southeast Asia,

1242
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
South Asia,

1243
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
East Asia, West Asia,

1244
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and so on.

1245
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
However,

1246
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
in the past,

1247
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the cultural background

1248
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
of every Asian country

1249
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
is very different.

1250
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
If you compare

1251
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
all of them,

1252
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
there may be some problems.

1253
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
For example,

1254
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
in the past few years,

1255
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
some organizations

1256
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
advocating for Asian

1257
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
people in the U.S.

1258
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
have said that

1259
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
people in the U.S.

1260
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
who need help

1261
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
are smart

1262
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and have good social status.

1263
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They don't need much help.

1264
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
However,

1265
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
the majority of

1266
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Asian people

1267
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
are from East Asia,

1268
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
such as Japan,

1269
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
South Korea, Taiwan,

1270
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
China,

1271
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and so on.

1272
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They are able to

1273
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
seek better education

1274
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and make money.

1275
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
In fact,

1276
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
many Asian people

1277
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
from Cambodia,

1278
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Vietnam,

1279
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and so on

1280
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
are also Asian.

1281
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
However,

1282
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
due to the label,

1283
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
they are unable

1284
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
to get the support

1285
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
they need.

1286
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Recently,

1287
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
some organizations

1288
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
are trying to

1289
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
put them under

1290
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
the same umbrella term.

1291
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
In my opinion,

1292
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
in the second phase

1293
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
of the study,

1294
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
we want to

1295
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
have a clearer and

1296
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
narrower group

1297
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
to focus on

1298
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the experience of

1299
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the adult period.

1300
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The narrative study

1301
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'll talk about later

1302
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
is about Chinese immigrants

1303
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
who are already

1304
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
in the adult period.

1305
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The transition

1306
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
to adulthood

1307
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
is defined as

1308
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
the transition from

1309
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
high school to

1310
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the adult period.

1311
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The IDEA requires

1312
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
the school to provide

1313
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the relevant services.

1314
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
However,

1315
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the implementation

1316
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
is not perfect.

1317
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
If there is a

1318
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
parental involvement,

1319
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
the post-school education

1320
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
or employment outcome

1321
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
of the child

1322
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
will be better.

1323
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Why do I want

1324
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
to talk about

1325
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Chinese-speaking immigrants?

1326
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
First,

1327
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
as you can see

1328
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
on the right,

1329
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Chinese is a commonly

1330
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
used language in the U.S.

1331
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Among the immigrants,

1332
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the green and purple

1333
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
represent the ability

1334
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
to speak English

1335
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
or to speak English

1336
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
fluently.

1337
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
In contrast,

1338
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Chinese-speaking immigrants

1339
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
are more likely to

1340
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
speak English fluently.

1341
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Vietnamese immigrants

1342
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
are more likely to speak English fluently.

1343
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Second,

1344
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
we are a research tool

1345
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
so the degree of

1346
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
my language and culture

1347
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
will affect

1348
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
my ability to

1349
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
understand the phenomenon.

1350
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
As an international student

1351
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and as a

1352
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Chinese-speaking immigrant

1353
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
who grew up

1354
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
in Taiwan,

1355
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I have the opportunity

1356
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
to live abroad.

1357
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
To be honest,

1358
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I am not a real immigrant

1359
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
because I have no experience

1360
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in Chinese culture

1361
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and my own language background.

1362
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
To sum up,

1363
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I decided to

1364
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
research Chinese-speaking immigrants

1365
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
if I wanted to

1366
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
learn more about

1367
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Chinese-speaking immigrants.

1368
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The purpose of this research

1369
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
is to understand

1370
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the experience of Chinese-speaking immigrants.

1371
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I adopted a narrative approach

1372
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
so that parents

1373
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
can interpret their past experiences.

1374
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Through the narrative approach,

1375
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
we can learn more about

1376
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
their current and past experiences

1377
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and how these experiences

1378
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
affect their values,

1379
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
thoughts, and behaviors.

1380
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
My inclusion criteria

1381
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
is that

1382
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
a Chinese-speaking immigrant

1383
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
needs to have a young adult child

1384
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
who is 18 to 35 years old

1385
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and has a hearing impairment.

1386
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
If a Chinese-speaking immigrant

1387
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
comes from a country

1388
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
where Chinese is spoken,

1389
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
some of the people

1390
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I interviewed

1391
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
were native speakers.

1392
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
As an executive researcher,

1393
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I can't speak Cantonese

1394
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
to some of them

1395
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
because of the limitations

1396
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
of my research.

1397
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
However, most of them

1398
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
can communicate better

1399
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
in English

1400
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
through Mandarin Chinese.

1401
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I can't exclude

1402
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
some families

1403
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
who have complicated medical needs.

1404
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If a family member

1405
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
needs a 24-hour ventilator,

1406
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
their lifestyle

1407
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
will be different

1408
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
from the family experience

1409
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
of an adult

1410
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
in a community.

1411
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
In this research,

1412
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
we excluded this type of family.

1413
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The convenient sample

1414
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
is the one I found

1415
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
in my book.

1416
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
During my research,

1417
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
we found five cases.

1418
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Most of them

1419
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
immigrated to the U.S.

1420
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
from 1983 to 1994.

1421
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
They were

1422
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
about 20 to 32 years old

1423
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
when they immigrated.

1424
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
One of them was a father.

1425
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Four of them were mothers.

1426
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
One of the children

1427
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
was a girl.

1428
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The other four were boys.

1429
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Three of them

1430
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
had different levels of autism.

1431
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Some of them were highly-functioning

1432
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and could go to a high school.

1433
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Some of them

1434
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
had a special education system.

1435
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Some of them

1436
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
had a combination of intellectual disabilities.

1437
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
The other two

1438
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
had cerebral palsy and intellectual disabilities.

1439
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
William's syndrome

1440
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
is also a genetic disease

1441
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
with some intellectual disabilities.

1442
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Only one of the parents

1443
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
moved to the U.S.

1444
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
because his child

1445
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
was already 8 years old

1446
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
in Taiwan.

1447
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
He thought

1448
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the U.S. could provide

1449
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
better special education services

1450
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
for his child.

1451
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The other four families

1452
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
immigrated to the U.S.

1453
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
for other reasons,

1454
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
such as work or education.

1455
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They had children

1456
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
after they got married

1457
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
in Taiwan.

1458
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I had three interviews

1459
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
with the parents

1460
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
in my data collection.

1461
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Each interview

1462
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
took about two hours

1463
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and each interview

1464
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
took about a week.

1465
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I met the parents

1466
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
in person three times

1467
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
and the interview took about

1468
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
a month.

1469
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The first interview

1470
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
was about self-introduction

1471
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and their family background

1472
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and their views on disabilities

1473
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and their goals

1474
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
for their children.

1475
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The second interview

1476
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
was about taking photos

1477
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and asking the parents

1478
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
to talk more

1479
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
about their stories

1480
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
in the photos.

1481
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We also asked

1482
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
about the impact

1483
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
on their environment

1484
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
during the interview.

1485
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The third interview

1486
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
was about time

1487
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and their past

1488
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and present.

1489
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
We asked the parents

1490
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
to reflect on

1491
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
their past

1492
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and present

1493
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and ask the parents

1494
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
to reflect on

1495
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
their past

1496
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and present

1497
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and ask the parents

1498
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
to reflect on

1499
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
their past

1500
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and present

1501
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and ask the parents

1502
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
to reflect on

1503
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
their past

1504
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and present

1505
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
and ask the parents

1506
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
to reflect on

1507
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
their past

1508
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and present

1509
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and ask the parents

1510
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
to reflect on

1511
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
their past

1512
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and present

1513
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
These are photos provided by the parents

1514
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
For example, this parent

1515
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
mentioned that

1516
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
her child is a volunteer

1517
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
in the hospital

1518
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
where she goes every morning

1519
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
and every day

1520
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Another parent

1521
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
mentioned that

1522
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
her child is in his early 20s

1523
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
when he graduated from high school

1524
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This is very important to her

1525
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
and she wants to talk about it

1526
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Another parent mentioned

1527
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
that she will participate in

1528
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
community activities

1529
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
with her child

1530
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
for the disabled

1531
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
This is a community activity

1532
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
where they go out

1533
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and do barbecue

1534
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It is a community activity

1535
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
where they go out

1536
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and do barbecue

1537
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
They may discuss

1538
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
the needs of their adult needs

1539
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
These two visual cues

1540
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
are what I will use

1541
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
in the interview

1542
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I will show this visual cue

1543
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
to the parents

1544
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I think this design

1545
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
is related to the background

1546
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
of the disability therapist

1547
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
We are used to

1548
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
providing various materials

1549
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
in the communication

1550
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
or service

1551
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
so that people with different needs

1552
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
have a better chance

1553
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
to understand

1554
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
what we are going to talk about

1555
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
We can help them

1556
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
visualize

1557
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I think this is related

1558
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
to the traditional

1559
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
one-to-one interview

1560
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We may see more

1561
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We use different materials

1562
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to promote this

1563
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
In terms of data analysis

1564
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
After the interview

1565
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
What did the parent

1566
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
say in the interview

1567
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
What did the parent say

1568
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
in the interview

1569
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Why did the parent say

1570
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
these things

1571
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and how did the parent

1572
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
say these things

1573
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I can't talk about

1574
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
the data analysis in detail

1575
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But if you are interested

1576
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I have some extra reports

1577
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I put them at the end of the report

1578
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We can discuss

1579
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Finally, I will compare

1580
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
what the parent said

1581
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Let's jump to the

1582
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
finding part

1583
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The first one is

1584
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
what they want to do

1585
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
In comparison to the

1586
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Meta-Fitness Study

1587
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
They focus on

1588
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
their adult life

1589
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
There are two things

1590
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
they want to do

1591
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
The first one is

1592
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I want to help my child

1593
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
develop independent living skills

1594
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
so that they can live independently

1595
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The second one is

1596
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I want to help my child

1597
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
develop independent adult life

1598
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Finally, I want to

1599
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
help my child

1600
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
live a happy and meaningful life

1601
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
live a happy and meaningful life

1602
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
In this process

1603
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
We see several themes

1604
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
The first one is

1605
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
their life

1606
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The first one is

1607
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
their life

1608
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The first one is

1609
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
their life

1610
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
How do they deal with

1611
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
the environment

1612
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The environment

1613
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
their life

1614
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Disagreements

1615
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Perceptions

1616
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
How do they deal with

1617
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
the situation

1618
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
about immigration

1619
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
How do they feel

1620
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
about

1621
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
their country

1622
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
This is just a demo

1623
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It may be more complicated than this

1624
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But what I want to say is

1625
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
There may be his family

1626
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
There are experts he interacts with

1627
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Then there are also his service providers

1628
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There may also be this society

1629
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
for

1630
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The attitude of the society

1631
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
towards the family

1632
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The community he lives in

1633
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
His resources and the whole

1634
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Maybe the related policy in the United States

1635
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
For him, it may all affect

1636
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
the role of his father-in-law

1637
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
For example, this parent said

1638
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
When his child graduated from high school

1639
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
He gave a speech

1640
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Then he said I was very surprised

1641
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
about his performance

1642
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
His teacher prepared a speech for him

1643
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Because of this experience, I started to feel

1644
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
In fact, it is possible to help my child

1645
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
to develop self-innovation

1646
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
He may not have this idea

1647
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
He just thought

1648
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's what he wanted to do

1649
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But because he saw this experience

1650
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
He saw the school teacher

1651
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
The school teacher provided this platform

1652
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
The school teacher also showed

1653
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
In fact, if there is appropriate support

1654
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
In fact, the child can

1655
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Speak out what they want to say

1656
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So these

1657
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Things have affected him

1658
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
How can he help his child

1659
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Just mentioned

1660
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
In addition to the passive influence

1661
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Parents also feel

1662
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
They have some active influence on their circle of life

1663
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
For example, there is a parent

1664
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Some parents may

1665
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It should be said that the first

1666
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
We see all the parents

1667
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They all feel

1668
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They play the role of this father-in-law

1669
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It's very important to their children

1670
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The second is that some parents think

1671
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Because this world can't always

1672
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Adapt to you

1673
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So we should be the one

1674
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Learn how to adapt to this world

1675
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
There are also some

1676
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
In the story of their parents

1677
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You can see their

1678
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Understanding of the world is more human

1679
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
As long as

1680
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I have a heart

1681
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I can do what I want to do

1682
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So for example

1683
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This parent

1684
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I just got two

1685
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
In the story

1686
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
They are very sure

1687
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
They will say that I am very sure

1688
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I 100% believe

1689
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It won't help my child

1690
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Usually this kind of plot

1691
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
They only happen

1692
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
They are describing the interaction between him and his child

1693
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But he may not necessarily use such a plot

1694
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Describe his interaction with other people

1695
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It's just that we talk through the parents

1696
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We can see

1697
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Parents actually know their children very well

1698
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Their relationship with their children

1699
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
To put it bluntly

1700
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
This thing

1701
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Their children are also their

1702
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The most important protagonist in the story

1703
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Okay, then

1704
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Some parents say

1705
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
He may have to adapt to this world

1706
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
For example, this parent said

1707
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I think this society is willing to accept

1708
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
This is what he said to his child

1709
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
He told me

1710
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
He said he thought this society was willing to accept you

1711
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's already good

1712
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Because this world can't adjust for you forever

1713
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So you have to learn how to adapt to this world

1714
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
This thing may be

1715
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Parents have different views on obstacles

1716
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Some parents think

1717
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because the problem is our own problem

1718
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's my own deficiency

1719
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Caused this situation

1720
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So I shouldn't have asked

1721
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This society does too much for me

1722
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But not every parent thinks so

1723
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Some parents may think

1724
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Yes, my child has such an obstacle

1725
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But I think this society should

1726
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Let everyone have the right to survive

1727
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Plus we have such a law

1728
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So in fact

1729
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
The school should also be able to do more

1730
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So that my child can live

1731
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I think this view

1732
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Also comes from their experience

1733
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This system is between

1734
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
There are some limitations

1735
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
They may not be able to overcome

1736
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Then I just talked about

1737
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
This kind of family

1738
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
For example, I saw parents

1739
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
One of the parents even moved his whole family

1740
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
To the United States

1741
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But of course this is a more specific example

1742
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But like other parents

1743
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Moving in different schools is also very common

1744
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Or they may also talk about

1745
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
There are many other families in my school

1746
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
They are all because

1747
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
This school has good resources

1748
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So they will move here

1749
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So they are actively seeking

1750
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
For their family

1751
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The most beneficial conditions

1752
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Then choose to start a family business in this place

1753
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Sometimes they

1754
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Except for themselves

1755
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I feel like

1756
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I am a role that is accepted

1757
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Sometimes they can actually switch to

1758
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
He also thinks that relying on his own ability

1759
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Is able to change this society

1760
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Or change the thoughts of other parents

1761
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Like this

1762
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
He said that I often take my son

1763
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
To participate in community activities

1764
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
In addition to the general public

1765
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
There are also quite a few politicians

1766
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I hope they can see my son

1767
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So they will know more

1768
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Disabled people are in need in society

1769
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And his preface is that there are votes

1770
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So he hopes politicians

1771
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Can pay more attention to these issues

1772
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Then he also said

1773
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
He saw more community parents

1774
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
In fact, there is this need

1775
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
He also felt that he had the opportunity

1776
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
To help others through his philosophy

1777
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
He did not think of his own life

1778
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Can achieve this thing

1779
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
He now feels that this is his life

1780
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Very important thing

1781
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Good

1782
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Then again, for them to immigrate

1783
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
In fact, most parents

1784
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Still talk about

1785
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
For immigrants

1786
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
He is more difficult

1787
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But although it is more difficult

1788
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But

1789
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Because they still feel

1790
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Most parents still feel

1791
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They will choose this place

1792
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Or because they recognize

1793
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
In this environment in the United States

1794
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
For disability

1795
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
This thing is more positive

1796
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So this thing

1797
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Also a big influence

1798
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
They choose this place

1799
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Take this place as their home

1800
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
For example, this parent

1801
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
In their country

1802
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
We have to bow our heads

1803
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I often feel that I am an outsider

1804
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Then he also talked about

1805
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
The story of his child's graduation

1806
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
He said

1807
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
When my child graduated from high school

1808
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I once discussed with other classmates

1809
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Can we make a group home together

1810
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But those white parents

1811
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Don't want to talk to me

1812
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
They probably just think

1813
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I can't speak English

1814
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
This parent also said

1815
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
You can't rely on others

1816
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
But it doesn't mean that these things are negative

1817
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But when you solve the problem

1818
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
In fact, you will learn a lot

1819
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Then this thing

1820
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I think these quotes

1821
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Not only this parent

1822
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Also called other parents

1823
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I feel like I'm an outsider

1824
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
This feeling

1825
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
In fact, there will be a lot of challenges

1826
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So for immigrants

1827
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Many things he is

1828
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
It's more difficult

1829
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
But their parents

1830
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
When it comes to American society

1831
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Also talked about a lot of content

1832
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
For example, they feel

1833
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
American society

1834
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Their views on disability

1835
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
May be much more positive than their native country

1836
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Like a parent

1837
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
He just came to the United States

1838
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Just found out

1839
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
These schools

1840
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
They will also be

1841
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
At the end of the semester

1842
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The child will perform on stage

1843
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
He thinks he has never thought

1844
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
His children can also

1845
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Even children with special needs

1846
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Can also have their own stage

1847
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
He thinks these things may come from

1848
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Americans

1849
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Or the whole American society

1850
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The awareness of disability may be different

1851
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Like this parent

1852
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
He also said that his children participated

1853
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
For them

1854
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
A very important program

1855
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
He interpreted

1856
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
The reason they chose this name

1857
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They believe

1858
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Although everyone's ability

1859
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
May be different

1860
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
If they have the right needs

1861
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Can still live like ordinary people

1862
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Then he felt

1863
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
This spirit is influenced by American culture

1864
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
He also felt

1865
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
About the training of disabled people

1866
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
There should be no better place

1867
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Unless you find a better place in the future

1868
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Otherwise, our whole family will live here

1869
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
This parent

1870
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
He used the word

1871
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
He is a Chinese immigrant

1872
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
He also had the opportunity

1873
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Under his setting conditions

1874
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
If you want to be in China

1875
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There is a good development

1876
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But he felt

1877
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
The training of disabled people is better

1878
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Like some parents

1879
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Although they are

1880
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Foreigners or immigrants

1881
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But he thinks we are already

1882
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
In the United States

1883
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
We also want to participate in this society

1884
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Invite other members of the community

1885
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Participate in local affairs in the United States

1886
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
These things

1887
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Like what they said here

1888
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The so-called influence of American culture

1889
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
May be with the American disability movement

1890
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Maybe from the 60s

1891
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Starting in the 50s and 60s

1892
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And their so-called

1893
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
This part of human rights

1894
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Will affect their whole country

1895
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Policy planning for mental health

1896
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Then

1897
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Also mentioned by many parents

1898
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It is quite common in the United States

1899
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
There are all kinds of support groups

1900
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
They rarely see in native countries

1901
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So

1902
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Through this narrative research

1903
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Then we are more open

1904
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Let the parents talk to them

1905
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
A more impressive story

1906
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Then we can see more

1907
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
They are in life

1908
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Important things to them

1909
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Maybe not just in the past research

1910
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Is the person who provides the service

1911
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
There are also some other things

1912
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I think using narrative research

1913
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
The uniqueness

1914
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You can see different things from him

1915
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Then we can see that

1916
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
They can also be in their narrative

1917
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
In the process of seeing their

1918
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Concept

1919
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Or what is the behavior

1920
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Based on their experience with this new country

1921
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Accumulated years of experience

1922
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And these interpretations affect their current

1923
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Interaction

1924
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Then this overall is

1925
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
We are back to these two studies

1926
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Then there are several

1927
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
What we see is that the parents are actually

1928
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Uh

1929
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
As a parent

1930
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Their willfulness is actually through

1931
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
They met these challenges

1932
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
There is a chance to show

1933
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That may be

1934
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Because the past research is more

1935
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
OK we are

1936
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Just keep documenting these barriers

1937
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But in fact, if you pay attention to the parents

1938
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
What are the main things

1939
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Then they are actually very willful

1940
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Even if they may encounter some challenges

1941
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
They still have different

1942
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
For example, coping strategies

1943
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Or they may even be able to

1944
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Further affect their right to life

1945
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What I want to say next is actually

1946
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Uh, because I just started

1947
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
What we are talking about is our professional thinking

1948
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Very concerned about the environment

1949
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Interaction between occupation

1950
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So for example

1951
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
They both

1952
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
In the study, we see that

1953
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
What are the things in this environment

1954
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
In fact, the impact is quite large

1955
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But every parent

1956
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
They may

1957
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
According to their current state

1958
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Or the environment around them

1959
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Their everyone to face the environment

1960
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Interactive mode is also quite different

1961
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
May still have their own

1962
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Uniqueness

1963
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So like this kind of research

1964
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It's just very simple here

1965
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Summarize this kind of research

1966
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Maybe it can be used

1967
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
After we know so much

1968
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Then the next part may be

1969
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
We represent that in fact

1970
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
A lot of parents are immigrating

1971
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
They actually need a lot

1972
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Some environmental resources

1973
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Let them know more

1974
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
What resources are available in this environment

1975
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
There is also a chance to meet

1976
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Other parents

1977
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
But if we have more in our environment

1978
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Similar parent center

1979
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It may be quite helpful

1980
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Then come again

1981
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
These service providers

1982
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
One or two really

1983
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Make them feel bad

1984
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
But for them

1985
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Even after many years

1986
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It's still very strong

1987
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I think this thing

1988
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Although in the past research

1989
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
There is also a constant mention of this matter

1990
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
But maybe we can do this kind of research

1991
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Emphasize the importance of this matter again

1992
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We can also review some past documents

1993
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
How do we create this

1994
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
The so-called sham free environment

1995
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Can do

1996
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The next is because the parents

1997
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
The uniqueness of their experience

1998
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And they are actually very capable

1999
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
They are not just people who need help

2000
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They can actively participate in many things

2001
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So maybe for them

2002
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
More effective intervention

2003
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's kind of like a coach

2004
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
For example, he is a sports player

2005
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
He himself actually

2006
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I know what I'm doing

2007
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
He has a lot of his

2008
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Ability to achieve

2009
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But if there is one at this time

2010
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We can discuss with him together

2011
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Then evaluate and help him

2012
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
He said which things you can

2013
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Think about it again

2014
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Maybe their

2015
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
On this matter

2016
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
More effective

2017
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Can be promoted

2018
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
As much as they can

2019
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
What they want to do

2020
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Except for these things

2021
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I think we do anything

2022
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
You can't get out of this historical moment

2023
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Like the recent

2024
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
These hate crimes

2025
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Based on some prejudices

2026
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Although it's not

2027
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Today's research

2028
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But for a long time

2029
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It's these Asians

2030
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Being regarded as

2031
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The so-called model minority

2032
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Or like everyone

2033
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
There is no need for their own needs

2034
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
To actively advocate this traditional

2035
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It may make a lot of people

2036
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Even if you want to understand

2037
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
They understand this group

2038
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
If you don't have the opportunity

2039
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
To let these groups

2040
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If the voice is heard

2041
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Then you are more likely to

2042
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Understand each other

2043
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
These prejudices may exist for a long time

2044
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Including what I just said

2045
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Not just these East Asian countries

2046
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Maybe other Asian countries

2047
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Their needs are harder to hear

2048
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So I think

2049
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I hope this kind of research

2050
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It can be promoted

2051
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Different researchers or different

2052
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
They are different

2053
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Cultural background

2054
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
There are these ways

2055
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Can let everyone know

2056
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
This type of research

2057
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I think it's not just in the United States

2058
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
In Taiwan, there are actually quite a lot of

2059
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But relatively little

2060
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
For example, Taiwan is actually

2061
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
An immigration society

2062
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Just say that our immigration structure

2063
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
May not be the same as the United States

2064
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
In fact, from Taiwan

2065
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Maybe since the 1990s

2066
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
In fact, Taiwan and the United States

2067
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Their rapid increase

2068
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
This number is actually rapid growth

2069
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
In fact, they are now

2070
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Our so-called new immigrants

2071
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
But for these new immigrants

2072
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
The process of employment in Taiwan

2073
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
At present, there is no relevant research

2074
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So I am actually

2075
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
After I returned to Taiwan

2076
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I also hope

2077
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
If I want to be in this place

2078
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Develop some

2079
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
For this place

2080
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
For local community

2081
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Do some more exploratory research

2082
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Then we can know more about their needs

2083
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
What is it

2084
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So today I still have some limitations

2085
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Of course, in the past, our research

2086
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
He will be limited to

2087
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Maybe we see this finding now

2088
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
It comes from me

2089
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I met this sample

2090
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
May need more in the future

2091
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Still need more research

2092
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Invest in this area

2093
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's just that there are good and bad

2094
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Start from a place

2095
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I hope this kind of research can be provided

2096
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Some new understanding

2097
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Perspective

2098
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Ok

2099
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
In the part of Acknowledgement

2100
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Of course, I am very grateful to the parents who participated

2101
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And my own past

2102
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Instructors and Kouwei

2103
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And this is my second research

2104
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
He actually has two

2105
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Advisory Board Members

2106
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
One is a parent

2107
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
A local NGO in Boston

2108
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
NGO staff

2109
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
He has long been with the local

2110
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Communicative community

2111
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So he also helped me with some cases

2112
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Then provide me a lot of assistance in the process

2113
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Then come again

2114
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
His founding source is from

2115
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Boston University

2116
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We are here

2117
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
The college is called Sargent College

2118
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
They provide a doctoral student

2119
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
A founding

2120
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Thank you very much for your participation today

2121
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
My report is probably here

2122
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
If you have any questions

2123
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
We should be able to

2124
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Enter the discussion stage

2125
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Thank you for the wonderful report

2126
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And speech

2127
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
At this time we will open

2128
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Q&A time

2129
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Then see if there are any participants who want to ask questions

2130
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
You can turn on your microphone at any time

2131
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
To ask questions

2132
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Or you can also write in the chat room

2133
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I can also help you ask questions

2134
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
When everyone is thinking

2135
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I just want to ask you

2136
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
If possible

2137
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
First

2138
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Thank you

2139
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
First of all

2140
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Thank you again for your wonderful speech

2141
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I want to ask

2142
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Actually when we talk about parenting

2143
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
You just started

2144
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Talking about parenting involvement

2145
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
In fact, for me

2146
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I think parenting involvement

2147
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It's actually a bright concept

2148
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It's parents

2149
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
How many things to do to the child

2150
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's actually a number concept

2151
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But within this number

2152
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
There may be different behaviors

2153
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I can imagine

2154
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
In the family of children with special needs

2155
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Parents to children

2156
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
In fact, in addition to

2157
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Specific to their

2158
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Disability

2159
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Some of the problems

2160
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
A special parenting behavior

2161
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
In addition to

2162
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
They may actually have other

2163
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
General parenting style

2164
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Or

2165
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Strategy

2166
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Or their general parenting atmosphere

2167
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm also very curious

2168
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
In your two studies

2169
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Especially in your first meta-analysis

2170
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Did you see

2171
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
In these families

2172
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
These immigrants

2173
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
They deal with children

2174
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
The changes in the special parenting behavior

2175
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
What are the differences from ordinary families

2176
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Different changes

2177
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Divided into two levels

2178
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
One is their special plan

2179
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The other is their

2180
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
General parenting behavior

2181
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
This is the first question

2182
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
The second question is

2183
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
In culture

2184
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I just said

2185
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's a level problem

2186
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The second level is when they move

2187
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
When they immigrated to the United States

2188
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Their culture shock

2189
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
It may not only reflect

2190
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Western culture

2191
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
They are also in their own past

2192
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
If they are Asian

2193
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Or maybe they are Chinese

2194
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Or Taiwanese

2195
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
They actually brought their own culture

2196
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
In this way

2197
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Under the conflict

2198
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Is it possible that their parenting behavior

2199
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Or their parenting atmosphere will also change

2200
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
This is the second question

2201
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
The third question is

2202
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You can answer it again

2203
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The third question is

2204
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
At the end of the question

2205
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Parent Perceived Role

2206
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
It's more like

2207
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Parenting Goal

2208
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Or Socialization Goal

2209
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
How do parents want to

2210
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
How to raise their children

2211
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm a little curious about this

2212
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Parents always have some expectations

2213
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Before they have children

2214
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
They have some fixed expectations

2215
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
After they have children

2216
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Their expectations will probably change

2217
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Especially when they

2218
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
When they have children

2219
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Their expectations

2220
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
How to change

2221
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
After the change

2222
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
As time goes by

2223
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
There may be some changes

2224
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I don't know your

2225
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Narrative study

2226
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Can answer this question

2227
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
How do they face this

2228
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
These three questions

2229
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
There is also a very important aspect

2230
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You just mentioned

2231
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Meta-synthesis

2232
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
It's a big

2233
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Global strategy

2234
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You mentioned a compound to expectation

2235
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I feel that

2236
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
In this matter

2237
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Parents and

2238
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Interaction with the environment

2239
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
May also be a very important

2240
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Influence factor

2241
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I asked three questions

2242
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
These are probably the three questions

2243
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Thank you

2244
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Let's start from the last question

2245
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Just mentioned

2246
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Is there any change in the expectation

2247
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
In fact, this matter

2248
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
In my sharing today

2249
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I didn't mention it

2250
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
But because of the change of time

2251
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I want to answer the question

2252
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I can give an example

2253
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
For example, there is a parent

2254
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
His child is

2255
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Autism

2256
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
In his interview

2257
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Keep mentioning

2258
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
At the beginning

2259
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Because

2260
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Autism is

2261
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You may not find out

2262
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Maybe he is three or five years old

2263
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Or even he is already in high school

2264
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like a parent

2265
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
He is already in high school

2266
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It seems to be elementary school or high school

2267
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
His child's anxiety

2268
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Becomes very serious

2269
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
So my child

2270
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So-called special child

2271
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
He has this

2272
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Asperger's or autism

2273
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
He didn't know when he was born

2274
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So these two parents

2275
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I think

2276
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Like a brain paralysis

2277
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
This is usually when you are born

2278
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You may know

2279
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Your child has this situation

2280
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
What will happen to him in the future

2281
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Their doctor

2282
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
May also give them some

2283
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
The so-called aftermath

2284
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
This child is probably like this

2285
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
This kind of

2286
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Give them a

2287
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Reduce their expectations

2288
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I think so

2289
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
They are different obstacles

2290
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sometimes this kind of slowly

2291
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Only realized

2292
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
This kind of obstacle

2293
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Their parents did mention

2294
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
They were very excited about their children at first

2295
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I hope he can go

2296
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Usually go to school like a child

2297
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Especially if the performance of the school is good

2298
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Gradually discovered

2299
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
My child has this special need

2300
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Or he is very anxious

2301
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
He began to adjust slowly

2302
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Reduce his expectations

2303
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
But later

2304
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It's not even adjusted

2305
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The point is different

2306
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Maybe he started earlier

2307
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
He also put it in

2308
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I hope his academic performance is good

2309
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Then he thought that as immigrants

2310
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
We want to be able to succeed in a new country

2311
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Must rely on education

2312
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So he felt that my child must

2313
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Find a good high school

2314
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
But then he slowly

2315
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Because of these things

2316
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
He slowly adjusted to say okay

2317
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It's okay if you can't go to college today

2318
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It's okay if you graduate from high school

2319
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It's okay if you really graduated from high school

2320
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It's okay if you can't really graduate from high school

2321
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Can you at least finish

2322
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
They have been adjusting

2323
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
In the end

2324
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
He talked about my expectations of my children

2325
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Those looking for a job

2326
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Of course he still hopes that his children

2327
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Can live independently

2328
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But what he cares about

2329
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
He is looking forward to his children

2330
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Can I let my children have a happy life

2331
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Better than his original

2332
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
For this child

2333
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Hope he is a traditional first-time

2334
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Or through education

2335
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Then find a good job for yourself

2336
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
This expectation is indeed

2337
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
In this narrative

2338
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
They often see it in the process of narrative

2339
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Then just

2340
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
The second question is about

2341
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Their culture shock

2342
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Please

2343
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Please

2344
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Sorry

2345
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Just because of this question

2346
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I am also curious

2347
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Maybe their expectation will change

2348
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
In the process of change

2349
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
How did they transform

2350
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
He may have received

2351
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
External resources

2352
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Or maybe his friend

2353
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I think many parents

2354
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
When he is facing this matter

2355
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
His mental change

2356
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I think more or less

2357
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
There may be some stimuli

2358
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Let him help him to do this

2359
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Then he may be emotional

2360
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Will there be some fluctuations

2361
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Sorry to interrupt

2362
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think the fluctuation is quite common

2363
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Usually the parents are describing

2364
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
In the process of these things

2365
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Even if they have adjusted

2366
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
My expectations of my children

2367
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
They usually describe this

2368
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
The process is quite painful

2369
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
He was originally

2370
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
As the expectation of ordinary parents

2371
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Then slowly

2372
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
He met

2373
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I think most of the time they will adjust expectations

2374
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Often encounter a lot of setbacks

2375
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Then met some of them

2376
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
No matter how hard they try

2377
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Things that can't be changed

2378
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Then this time

2379
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
This emotion and this setback

2380
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
This happened

2381
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Then another one happened

2382
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
They may also interact with the teacher

2383
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Or interact with other families

2384
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
The setback may be that they have this high expectation

2385
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Then slowly reduce

2386
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
They will be very anxious

2387
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
They don't know

2388
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
If my child can't do this

2389
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I only know that way

2390
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
If this way can't succeed

2391
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Then my child

2392
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
There is no other place to go

2393
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I can't imagine

2394
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
What should I do

2395
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
But usually this time

2396
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
There will be a slight bounce back

2397
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Is that they see other children

2398
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Other families he knows

2399
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Older children than him

2400
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
They may often mention that I know that

2401
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Their children are a little older than us

2402
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Then his ability is about the same

2403
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
A little better

2404
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
But what did I see them do

2405
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I think they seem to be pretty good

2406
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
So often this time they

2407
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Fall into that valley

2408
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I don't know how to go up

2409
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
The model they see around

2410
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Or need the teacher to provide

2411
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Suggestions or possibilities

2412
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
For them

2413
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Is that they adjust this expectation

2414
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Slowly and more

2415
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
More comfortable

2416
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
A key thing in life

2417
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Probably like this

2418
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Then I go back to the second one now

2419
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
The second question

2420
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Just talked about

2421
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
How to be a parent with the original Asian culture

2422
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Then to a new place

2423
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
There seems to be some impact

2424
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
This thing actually started with me

2425
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Because when I was reading the file

2426
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I did talk about this so-called culture

2427
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Conflicts

2428
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Then I was expecting

2429
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I may see more conflicts in this research

2430
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Originally my native culture

2431
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Tell me how my parents should be better

2432
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
It doesn't seem to be the same here

2433
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So I seem to have some conflicts

2434
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm going to find a way

2435
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Reorganize myself

2436
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
But the unexpected thing

2437
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
This thing seems to be in my

2438
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
In this sample

2439
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Obviously I asked them

2440
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So for example

2441
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Is there anything you think

2442
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
You want to do what you think you should do

2443
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But after coming here, I found out that everyone seems not like this

2444
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I am just this sample

2445
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I didn't see too many

2446
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
This example is more

2447
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
They feel here

2448
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
In the parents' expectations

2449
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
On the contrary, it is more open

2450
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
He may think

2451
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Of course there is a piece

2452
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Advocacy part

2453
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I didn't have this expectation in the past

2454
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Now come here and find this expectation

2455
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
But this expectation

2456
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
In my sample

2457
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It doesn't seem to make them feel very painful

2458
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But also in that part

2459
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Can show you a quote

2460
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
He is

2461
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Other research mentioned

2462
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
But he is 2009

2463
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So I don't know if this thing is related to time

2464
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Then this parent he talked about

2465
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
He learned to have advocacy

2466
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But he also said that he felt this thing was very painful

2467
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
For example, he is very worried

2468
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Does it look disrespectful or pushy

2469
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But actually I know

2470
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I need to do this

2471
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Then he also recognized that he knew some American mothers

2472
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
They can say a lot of things very quickly

2473
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Whether it's right or wrong

2474
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
In short, you just say it

2475
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
If you disagree, you have to speak up

2476
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
For him, this mother

2477
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
He is a mother from Japan

2478
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
He thinks this thing is too magical

2479
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I didn't think I would do this

2480
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Then it's not the same as the education I received

2481
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
The background is not the same

2482
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Then we have to do this thing now

2483
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's difficult for me

2484
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Even though I've been here for so many years

2485
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So like this

2486
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I thought I was in my interview

2487
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Will see a similar conflict

2488
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
But in my five samples

2489
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It seems to be okay

2490
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
But I think this will be because of my sample

2491
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
To be honest

2492
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
He is actually a

2493
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Their corresponding knowledge level

2494
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Are relatively high

2495
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
They are relatively

2496
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
There are quite a lot of resources

2497
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
For example

2498
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If you see this

2499
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Their family income and education level

2500
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Except for this second case

2501
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
They seem to be slightly

2502
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It's not that high

2503
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
In fact, other families

2504
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
They have to have the desire

2505
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Come to this two-hour interview

2506
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Three interviews in a row

2507
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Their family resources

2508
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Knowledge level is higher

2509
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
So actually I think

2510
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Maybe it's because of this

2511
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I didn't see so many conflicts

2512
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
But in this parent

2513
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
On this second parent

2514
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
He described a lot

2515
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
For example, he thinks he doesn't want his children

2516
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
He hopes his children to study hard

2517
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Don't keep going to parties

2518
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
He has different

2519
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Except for his own disabled child

2520
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
This child has a brother

2521
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That brother is an ordinary child

2522
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
He is in the process of telling the story

2523
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
He thinks he doesn't want his children

2524
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
He said his brother

2525
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
That brother may have to take a big test

2526
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I went to the party the day before

2527
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
He felt bad

2528
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
He had a little dispute with his son

2529
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
As a result, when he went to school

2530
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
The school teacher told him

2531
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I just like your son

2532
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I think it's good

2533
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
You should not only read

2534
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
You should also play

2535
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Americans play this set

2536
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
You should let them look like this

2537
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Some conflicts

2538
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
It did happen to this mother

2539
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But I don't know why

2540
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
On the other 1345

2541
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
They will talk about the difference

2542
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
For example, there is a parent

2543
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
He came to America

2544
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Found that American schools emphasize

2545
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Independent living ability

2546
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's not the same as he imagined

2547
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
They may emphasize

2548
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You have to let your children use the dishwasher

2549
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
You may have to teach your children

2550
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Make sandwiches

2551
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
He may be different

2552
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
But he didn't think

2553
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
This is a very difficult conflict for him

2554
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
He felt

2555
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It turned out to be like this

2556
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Can I learn

2557
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I think it's pretty good

2558
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
He has the ability

2559
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
To face new expectations

2560
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
When he thinks it's good

2561
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
For him

2562
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
The cultural difference

2563
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Did not cause him too much pressure

2564
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I think I will learn

2565
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
This part is true

2566
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
With me in the file

2567
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Or before I entered this research

2568
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Assumption is a bit different

2569
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I think it has something to do with the sample

2570
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Then the first question

2571
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Is about

2572
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Educational behavior

2573
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Educational behavior

2574
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I think this thing is quite interesting

2575
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
He actually has a lot of files

2576
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
The so-called educational behavior

2577
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It may be more focused on him

2578
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Interaction between parents and children

2579
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
But in this research

2580
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
The focus we wanted to do

2581
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Not educational behavior

2582
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
What we want to do is

2583
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Educational resources in the environment

2584
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Or interaction with medical resources

2585
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So this part

2586
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
In my interview

2587
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
There is no great bias

2588
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
To talk about educational behavior

2589
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
But I didn't ask the parents

2590
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
How do you teach your children

2591
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But because we are talking

2592
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Transition to adulthood

2593
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
How to help

2594
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
What are they interacting with their children

2595
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I can think of now

2596
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Several impressive examples

2597
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
For example

2598
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
They learned some

2599
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
They may see Americans

2600
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
More praise children

2601
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So they think this set of their children

2602
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Also quite effective

2603
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So there may be two or three parents

2604
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I mentioned that I was teaching him

2605
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I will always encourage him

2606
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Then I will know what he is interested in

2607
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
What is stuck

2608
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I will also say quickly

2609
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Or do we want to rest first

2610
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Or I will come back later

2611
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Re-discuss this matter

2612
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So I think they are in this process

2613
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I mentioned some education

2614
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
But this is not my original

2615
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
The focus of the problem

2616
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So it's more about the parents

2617
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I didn't ask comprehensively

2618
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Then I didn't analyze it

2619
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
For this one

2620
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But their education

2621
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I think it's special

2622
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
The way they see it in the United States

2623
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And mainly their children

2624
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
This particularity

2625
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
May make them

2626
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Compared to ordinary parents

2627
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
They have more opportunities to see

2628
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Other teachers

2629
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Or other parents

2630
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
How do they teach

2631
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Children with neurodegenerative disorders

2632
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
They may be more inclined to learn

2633
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
This type of education

2634
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But I didn't ask

2635
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
When you teach this child

2636
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
With another child

2637
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Do you have any

2638
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Big difference

2639
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I don't know if I answered

2640
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
The three questions you wanted to ask

2641
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Thank you

2642
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Thank you very much

2643
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I think I learned a lot

2644
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
My question is like this

2645
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I just saw

2646
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Pei Chen

2647
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
There is a question

2648
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Do you want to see the microphone yourself

2649
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Okay

2650
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Hello

2651
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Hello

2652
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Thank you

2653
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Thank you

2654
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Thank you

2655
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
It seems like

2656
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
The sound is a bit cut off

2657
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Is it a signal

2658
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Gao Shen, can you hear it clearly? Or is it just me?

2659
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I don't seem to hear it

2660
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Can you hear it like this?

2661
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yes, I can

2662
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Much better

2663
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Sorry

2664
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Thank you for your presentation

2665
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I learned a lot

2666
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Then I am

2667
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Zhen Pei Chen

2668
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I just graduated

2669
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I have a curious question

2670
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Is

2671
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
You observed these parents in the United States

2672
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I am quite curious

2673
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
These parents

2674
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Will they all focus on the same

2675
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Parental Support Group

2676
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Or

2677
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Are they scattered in different

2678
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Parental Support Group

2679
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Because your analysis also mentioned

2680
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
They think they can change

2681
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Some of the community level

2682
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
They can have some influence

2683
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Or creativity

2684
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Want to change some community level things

2685
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Then I am quite curious

2686
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Are they a group of people to change together

2687
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Or more

2688
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
One person has to face

2689
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The whole community

2690
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
People like this

2691
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I just want to know

2692
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Your observation

2693
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Because I found these parents

2694
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
They don't know each other

2695
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Then they all live in the Greater Boston area

2696
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
But they didn't participate in

2697
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
What Support Group

2698
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Although they all mentioned

2699
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
The existence of this Support Group

2700
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But also for Asian

2701
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Or for families who speak Chinese

2702
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
As far as I know

2703
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
There are not many in Boston

2704
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It may be one or two years

2705
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
These parents

2706
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Sometimes they go to school

2707
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
He may participate

2708
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
He may go to this school

2709
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
This school originally their parents

2710
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
There are some organizations like parent meetings

2711
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Then they have this opportunity to participate

2712
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Group with other parents

2713
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
But not necessarily a Support Group

2714
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Maybe just everyone discuss together

2715
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
This so-called IEP

2716
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Or the school

2717
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Children's rights

2718
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
He will observe through these ways

2719
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Other non-Asian immigrants

2720
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Parents

2721
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
How do they interact with this community

2722
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
One of the parents

2723
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
He mentioned that he also wanted to do this

2724
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Support Group

2725
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
He found this very interesting

2726
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Then he just had a person

2727
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
He felt that OK

2728
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
In fact, this is great

2729
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Then we Asians seem to be relatively small

2730
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Then I will do it myself

2731
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
He felt good

2732
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Then I have to rely on myself

2733
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
The quote he used

2734
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
He said he wanted to influence his community

2735
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
That's a dad

2736
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Just his own job

2737
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
He is in an NGO

2738
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
But his object is the elderly

2739
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Then he lives in that area

2740
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
More

2741
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Is a Chinese immigrant

2742
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Then their position

2743
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Relatively

2744
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Not so rich

2745
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Resource area

2746
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
His original job

2747
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
This Asian community is very close

2748
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Then he just felt

2749
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
This Asian community was originally doing service

2750
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But he felt that he could just

2751
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Through his connection with this community

2752
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Let everyone in his community know

2753
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
He has a disabled child

2754
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Then he also encouraged others because of this

2755
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
There are parents in this community who are also disabled

2756
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Willing to take the child out

2757
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Strictly speaking

2758
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I don't think they have yet

2759
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
How many people do we need to gather together

2760
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Do this thing together

2761
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I have the ability and resources now

2762
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I still have time to invest

2763
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Then I am around me

2764
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
To influence the people I know around me

2765
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
At this level

2766
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
As far as I know

2767
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I just met another one recently

2768
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
He is a social worker

2769
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Then he is in Boston

2770
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
They are really providing

2771
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
To parents who speak Chinese

2772
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
They have support groups

2773
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Then there are parents who speak Portuguese and Spanish

2774
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
But I still don't know about them

2775
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Because of the situation

2776
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I met the epidemic

2777
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Because of the epidemic

2778
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
No face-to-face contact

2779
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
If they are this kind of organization

2780
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
They are more organized

2781
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Provide this kind of service

2782
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They are not parents

2783
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
They are more

2784
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He is a NGO doing similar things

2785
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Thank you

2786
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
No

2787
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Thank you

2788
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Then we ask the audience on site

2789
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Any other questions

2790
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
If everyone has no other questions

2791
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Or maybe later

2792
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
We can discuss again

2793
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Or maybe in private

2794
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Contact the epidemic

2795
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
If you feel

2796
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
If it's convenient

2797
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
We can do a final sum up

2798
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Do you have anything

2799
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I want to share

2800
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Take home message

2801
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I think the main first thing

2802
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I think

2803
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Why do you want to do this research

2804
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I think this group of people

2805
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Their voice is less heard

2806
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
May be limited to

2807
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Language

2808
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
The past research is still more mainstream

2809
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Even in white families

2810
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
People with high social status

2811
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Experience

2812
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I hope through this kind of research

2813
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Can let everyone see this kind of research

2814
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Less presented

2815
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So this is what I do

2816
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
This kind of research

2817
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
The motivation

2818
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
This kind of research

2819
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It should be more and more

2820
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Not just in certain groups

2821
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I hope it's in all kinds of

2822
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
People with cultural backgrounds

2823
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Should have this kind of research

2824
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
To understand their experience

2825
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
The second thing I want to talk about

2826
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Maybe as

2827
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Professionals or clinical staff

2828
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Sometimes our perspective

2829
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Will be more limited

2830
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
The interaction between me and this person

2831
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
But I hope through this kind of research

2832
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
What I want to bring to everyone

2833
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
When you face this person

2834
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Or his past

2835
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
The present and future

2836
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Actually affect

2837
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Why is he here now

2838
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
With what he is doing now

2839
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
But we usually may

2840
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
No more than this

2841
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Or did not have the opportunity to understand his past

2842
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
You may be right

2843
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
What he is doing now

2844
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Can't understand

2845
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
If he is different from what you think

2846
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
There may be some conflicts

2847
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But I hope through this kind of research

2848
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
For everyone to see

2849
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
We face this individual

2850
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Then

2851
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Next

2852
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I think I mainly want to tell you

2853
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
These two things

2854
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I also hope in the future

2855
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Can do some in Taiwan

2856
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Apply this type of research

2857
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
But I don't think this

2858
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
This kind of research discovery

2859
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
It can be directly in another country

2860
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
After all, the conditions of each country

2861
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Or historical background

2862
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Are very different

2863
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I think this kind of thing

2864
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
If you want to be in different places

2865
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
To do it

2866
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It actually takes some time

2867
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Do the local community

2868
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You may have a deeper understanding

2869
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
You know how to target

2870
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
You want to provide services

2871
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Provide the most effective thing for them

2872
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So probably

2873
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
If today's take-home

2874
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
I hope these three points

2875
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Thank you Yiting

2876
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Thank you for your wonderful speech today

2877
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And the take-home message just now

2878
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I think for many of our audience

2879
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
It should be very helpful

2880
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Okay, our speech today

2881
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Officially ends here

2882
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So I will stop recording now
