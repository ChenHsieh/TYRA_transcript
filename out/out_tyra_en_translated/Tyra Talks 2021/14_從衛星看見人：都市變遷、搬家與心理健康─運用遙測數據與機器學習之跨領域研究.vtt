00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you all for attending this lecture.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
I am a PhD student at the University of Belize.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I am very happy to be able to host this lecture for Project TIRA.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
From seeing people from satellites, urban transformation, moving and mental health,

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
applying remote data and machine learning cross-field research.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
TIRA is a PhD student from various fields in Taiwan,

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
an organization made up of PhD students, post-doctorate researchers and assistant professors.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
We hope to connect young researchers from different fields.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Today's speaker, Chi-Hsing, we met in the first English class.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
We belong to different fields of science and technology.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Recently, because of this lecture, we are in contact again.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I think this is the purpose of Project TIRA.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
To connect scholars from different fields.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Chi-Hsing just got his doctorate from the Department of Environmental Science at the University of Austria.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
He is currently a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
When he was a post-doctoral student,

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
he conducted research on typhoons in Taiwan and the Philippines.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
During his post-doctoral studies, he also conducted research in the United States.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
His current post-doctoral research project is mainly in the Himalayas.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
In the next two years, he will receive the Yale Gallaudet Donnelly Fellowship.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
He is expected to travel from Africa to the world.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Chi-Hsing will give a lecture for about an hour.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
After that, there will be a Q&A time.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't have much to say about Chi-Hsing, so I'll give you the time.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Today, I will divide this lecture into two parts.

01:59.000 --> 02:08.000
The first part is about how we can use satellite imagery and machine learning to detect loss.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
The second part will focus on the relationship between loss and mental health in Denmark.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Before we start, I'd like to take a short break.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Please let me know if the connection is bad.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
At the beginning, I'd like to talk about my research theme from a view that you may be familiar with.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
In this photo of Taipei City, if you can see my mouse,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
this road here, the road under the building, what is it like?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
In the north of Zhongshuo East Road,

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
you can imagine that this area is more like an apartment building.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
The density of the street is higher, and the width of the street is narrower.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
In the south of Zhongshuo East Road, the business district,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
we can see that the construction rate is much lower.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
There is a lot of space between the buildings.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
At the same time, it is not a low-density form.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
If you look at it from a vertical perspective, it has a lot of skyscrapers.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
In the past, many urban planners and environmental scientists

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
have been thinking about what kind of urban form is the best or the most sustainable.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
In terms of sustainability, there are two aspects that have often been discussed in the past.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
The first is how to make urban planning reach the goal of carbon reduction under the climate change.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
For example, if today's land use configuration can make the workplace and residences close enough,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
so that people don't have to travel a long distance when they're on vacation,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
this can achieve the effect of carbon reduction.

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
The second aspect of the study is to regard the city as a separate system for land use.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
In addition to the city, there are usually rural areas or natural protected areas.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
For environmental scientists and eco-scientists,

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
if we can make the city's land use appear in a very limited space range and efficiently expand to other places,

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
then we can save more land for agriculture or other crops.

04:52.000 --> 05:04.000
My interest in the study is a little different from the two aspects of the city as another aspect of the environment.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
What I'm interested in is the part about people.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
When we talk about sustainability, it's not about the sustainability of the environment,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
but it's about people and the environment.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
People themselves have to be able to live in this place in a sustainable way.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm very lucky to work on this project during my Ph.D. period.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
The main theme of the project is psychological health.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I also had the opportunity to start working on this project.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I'd like to give you a data on psychological health.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
In the past ten years,

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
the World Health Organization has conducted a survey of various countries around the world.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
It can be found that an average of four people in the world

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
will have a certain stage in their life when they are affected by any psychological disease.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
This is only the population that has been recorded due to old age.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
In fact, the number will be higher.

06:01.000 --> 06:14.000
Psychological health has many social factors.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
What is the relationship between the building environment and psychological health?

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I can think of it in three directions.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
The first one is that we can imagine that the sun's exposure to the sun is related to our physical and mental health.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
This will affect our mood.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
In terms of environmental vision,

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
people may look out of the window and see what the street scene is.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Or the environment gives you a feeling of pressure or a sense of pressure.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
This will also cause us to have different reactions psychologically.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
The third point is that the urban structure of our society is closely related to our social interactions.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Let me give you a simple example of my grandmother's house.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
My grandmother's house is a fishing village in the south of Taiwan.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
The main urban design of this fishing village is like this.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
There is a series of residential areas around the main provincial highway.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
This residential area is a large area.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
The connection in the middle of this large area is a small alley.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
The distance between each small alley is about five meters.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
In other words, the car can't get in.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
There are two main types of houses in this residential area.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
One is a three-room house.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
The other is a Milan-style building with about four or five floors.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
The function of this three-room house in the residential area is that

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
there is an underground water drain in the middle of the three-room house.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
So everyone goes to that place to chat and get water.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Every time I go back to my grandmother's house,

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
I can often hear that everyone is quarreling in the alley or in the three-room house.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
But no, they are just chatting.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
In another era, when my grandmother's children grew up and lived in the city,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
some of them moved to Kaohsiung City and moved to Taitung City.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
For example, my father moved to a community building in Taitung City.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
In this community building, their lifestyle became that

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
when my father got home, he parked his car and went straight to the 11th floor of the elevator to the apartment.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Through the legend of the elevator in this apartment,

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
he was actually in the same building as his neighbor.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Maybe there was only a wall or a floor area.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
But even so, it almost completely avoided the possibility of communication with those neighbors.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
So what is the lifestyle of our residents?

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
It will also affect the way we interact with our neighbors around us.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
In the past, the study of what kind of urban lifestyle is related to mental health

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
is actually a more abstract or simplified way of understanding it.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
It regards urban and rural as a spectrum of urban and rural.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
In this spectrum, they are usually divided into two groups,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
that is, urban people and rural people.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
In these two groups, they conduct a lot of research,

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
including in Africa or other European countries, as well as the United States.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
This study is a comprehensive study.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
It collects data from dozens of European and American countries.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
It turns out that in general, in these countries,

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
the ratio of depression and anxiety,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
that is, the ratio of population infection,

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
In the context of globalization and the constant increase of urban population,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
it is almost impossible to say that

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
it is because living in a rural area is healthier,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
so we try to encourage everyone to live in a rural area.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
For me, there is a very interesting question here,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
that is, in urban environments,

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
what kind of urban design and urban planning

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
can be psychological health?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
This is my main research motivation.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Let me introduce it to you.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
When I was doing this research,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
in fact, there were already a lot of predecessors,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
that is, the previous researchers,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
who had already thought a lot about this issue.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
But in the study method,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
the past research is more limited to small-scale research,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
because they need to go through, for example, questionnaire survey,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
to understand what the living environment

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
of their subjects is like.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Because psychological health is a very complicated issue,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
compared to other areas,

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
such as work, career, family life, etc.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Therefore, when it comes to the living environment,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
in many cases,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
if the sample is small,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
it will be more limited to research.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Therefore, one of the main breakthroughs in my PhD program

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
is how we can use satellite images and big data

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
to achieve a large-scale environmental feature,

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
and then connect such large-scale spatial information

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
with health information storage,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
that is, the entire population of Denmark.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Let me show you

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
what the satellite image I am currently using looks like.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
This image is Landsat,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
a satellite from NASA.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
It is summarized in series from Landsat 5 to Landsat 8,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
from 1984 to the present.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It took 16 days to take this image,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
so you can see what the image is like.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
This image has an obvious problem

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
when it is recognized in the form of a story.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
You can see the comparison of these two images here.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
The one on the left is Google Earth,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
a high-resolution satellite image.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
The one on the right is the same one.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It is more clear because it is placed further away,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
but if we look at it closely,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
you will find that it is blurry

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
like a mosaic.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
It's hard to really see

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
which side is the tall building, which side is the low building,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
which side is the crowded residential area,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
and which side is the windshield.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
If you want to use a satellite image

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
to understand the entire city's

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
shape, structure, and health,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
in my thesis,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
the first part of the problem to be solved is

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
how do we use artificial intelligence,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
especially the power of learning,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
to solve the limitation of the satellite image.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
The second part is that

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
when we make a breakthrough in methodology,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
and get large-scale spatial information,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
how do we connect it with the satellite image?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
The first part of the study will be

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
the first half of the study.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I will let you ask questions first

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
when the first half of the study is over.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
The first part is mainly about

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
when we get a satellite image,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
like this picture on the left,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
we hope to convert this satellite image

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
through machine learning

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
into the spatial information on the right.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Spatial information includes

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
which parts of the image

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
belong to the tall building,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
the low building,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
the crowded residential area, and so on.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
In this study,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
we will use the image of

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
the limited landsat

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
to compare different methods of

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
machine learning and deep learning,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
to see which method

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
has more advantages in this topic.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Then we will see that

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
if this method can be trained well

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
in the Danube case,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
can it be applied to other places

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
and have more potential for expansion?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
First of all, this is the framework of our classification.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
As mentioned earlier,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
in terms of urban density,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
it is a concept of gradient.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It will be divided into low density,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
medium density, and high density.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
In terms of building height,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
this is a system designed

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
for the Danube context.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
There are not many tall buildings in the Danube,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
so you can imagine that

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
it is a system of building height

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
below the third floor.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Above the third floor,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
we call it an apartment

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
or an open space.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
This is an overview of

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
the entire research framework.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
In the upper left corner,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
you can see that

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
this is the satellite image

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
we use,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
which has been integrated

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
from 1985 to 2018.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
There is an image that

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
has not been affected by the cloud.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
After obtaining this image,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
we need to

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
let this model

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
learn something.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
We need to give it some training data.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
This training data

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
comes from Guangda.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Guangda is simply

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
a laser pulse.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
When it hits an object,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
there is a time difference.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
This time difference can measure the shape of the object.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Therefore,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
this data is a 3D model

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
of the entire Danube.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
We divide this 3D model

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
into two parts.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
One is training data,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and the other is verification data.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
In terms of models,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
we have three models.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
The following is a common

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
method of learning

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
deep learning.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It is not deep learning,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
but its computing speed is relatively fast.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
The two models above

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
are deep learning models.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Let's talk about the middle one first.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It is actually the simplest

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
rotating machine model.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You often hear of CNA.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The one above

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
is a little more complicated than the one below.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
But its base is the same.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It also comes from a

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
3D model.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
In the model design,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
there is a pooling layer

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
in the middle.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
To put it simply,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
what it is doing

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
is to

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
increase the speed of the machine.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But what is it?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I would like to introduce it to you now.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
As mentioned earlier,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
when we use high-resolution

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
commercial satellites,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
we can clearly see

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
the same structure

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
and different architectural forms.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But the same range

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
is completely different.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
In the same range,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
it is difficult to see

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
which side is the high-rise

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and which side is the flat.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But if we can

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
consider the information

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
of the multi-level building,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
it will be a little different.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
For example,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
in this block of the high-rise,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
there are three long

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
pixels.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
The reason why the pixels are darker

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
is because there are more

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
buildings in this area.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
If we look further,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
we can see

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
that

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
the design of

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
this new community

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
is more

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
urbanized.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
For example,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
the buildings in this area

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
are more organic

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
and more deformed.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
So,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
on a larger scale,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
we can see that

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
the structure can help us

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
distinguish which side is the high-rise

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and which side is the flat.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
When we have trained

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
these models and data,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
we will use

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
the verification data

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
to verify the performance of the model.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
What I want to mention here is that

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
the year of verification

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
data is different

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
from the year of training data.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
For example, our training data is 2014,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
but when we verify it,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
we want to know

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
whether the model

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
that has been trained

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
recently can be used

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
to draw a historical urban model.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
So, we found data from

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
2006 and 1995

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
that can be used

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
to draw a historical urban model.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Here is the research result.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I want to introduce

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
the six types of urban models

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
in Denmark.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The first one is the high-rise

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
with high density.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
The high-density apartment buildings

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
are mainly located in the city center.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Here, we found two big cities

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
in Denmark,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Denmark and

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Denmark.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
In this picture,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
the high-density apartment buildings

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
are represented as one group in immigrant

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
communities,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
the rest areas are

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
isolated to the city center

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
as one group.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
In this picture,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
the high-density apartment buildings

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
are represented as one group

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
in immigrant communities,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
the rest areas are isolated

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
as one group.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
The third and fourth

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
sheets of yellow

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
architectural formula

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
symbolize Denmark's

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
major residential system.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Republican apartments

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
are simply

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
high-density

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
built in contact

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
with neighborhood

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
between city centers

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and settlements.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
As you can see,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
the yellow part

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
of the low-density

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
apartment

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is all

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
high-density.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
You can imagine

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
this type of apartment

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
as a house in Europe

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
with lots of greenery

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
around it.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
What is a low-density

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
high-density apartment like?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
This type of apartment

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
can be located

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
on the outskirts

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
of the city

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
or around the park

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
and next to the river

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
to the first row of water.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It is a high-density apartment.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
The low-density

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
low-rise apartment

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
is a low-density

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
high-density apartment.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
We found that

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
in the case of Denmark,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
the low-density

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
low-rise apartment

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
is more

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
common than

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
the high-density

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
high-density apartment.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
We found that

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
in the case of

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Germany,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
the low-density

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
low-rise apartment

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
is more common than

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
the high-density

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
high-density apartment.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
We found that

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
in the case of Germany,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
the low-density

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
low-rise apartment

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
is more common than

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
the high-density

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
high-density apartment.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
We found that

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
in the case of

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Germany,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
the low-density

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
low-rise apartment

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
is more common than

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
the high-density

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
high-density apartment.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
We found that

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
in the case of

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Germany,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
the low-density

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
low-density apartment

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
is more common than

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
the high-density

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
high-density apartment.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
We found that

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
in the case of

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Germany,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
the low-density

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
low-density apartment

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
is more common than

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
the high-density

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
high-density apartment.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
We found that

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
in the case of

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Germany,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
the low-density

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
low-density apartment

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
is more common than

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
the high-density

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
high-density apartment.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
We found that

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
in the case of

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Germany,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
we found that

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
in the case of

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Germany,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
the low-density

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
high-density apartment

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
is more common than

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the high-density

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
high-density apartment.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
We found that

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
in the case of

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Germany,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
the low-density

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
high-density apartment

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
is more common than

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
the high-density

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
high-density apartment.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We found that

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
in the case of

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Germany,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
the low-density

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
high-density apartment

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
is more common than

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
the high-density

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
high-density apartment.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
We found that

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
in the case of

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Germany,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
the low-density

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
high-density apartment

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
is more common than

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
the high-density

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
high-density apartment.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
We found that

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000

Germany,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
is more common than

the high-density

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000

When we go from

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
yellow to red

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It is gradually

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
more and more modulation

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
For example,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
this high-density IR

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
In the original right of this curve

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Its risk relative to

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the lower-density is relatively high

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
However, when it controls the modulation

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Its risk

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
is relatively reduced

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
In other words,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
the high-density IR

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
can be controlled by

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
other social mechanisms

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
However, even if it is excluded

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Its risk is about 1.4 times

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
higher than

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
the low-density IR

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
in rural areas

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
On the other hand

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
What is more interesting is that

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
we originally expected that

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
rural areas would have the lowest risk

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
However, in the case of depression

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
As you can see

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
The lower-density IR

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
is relatively low

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Its risk is actually

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
lower than that of rural areas

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
In other words, although it is in the urban area

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
But in this architectural state

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Its risk is actually

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
not higher than that of rural areas

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
We just

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
found the risk-benefit relationship

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
We present its spatial state

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
on the map of Denmark

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
the three main cities of Denmark

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
including Copenhagen

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Aarhus

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
and Corpus

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
It also produces

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
an interesting pattern

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
In the original

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
we expected that

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
rural areas should be pink

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Everyone is happier

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The risk is relatively low

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
As you can see

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Not only rural areas are pink

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
The city center of the city is also pink

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Especially in the city center

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
On the port side

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
on the river bank

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
and some green areas

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
are the areas with the lowest risk

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Which area is the area with the highest risk?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
It is not in the center of the city

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Instead, it is in

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
the suburbs

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Especially

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
the areas with more walls

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
It is relatively

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the area with the highest risk

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
So I want to go back

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
to the first question

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
of today

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
What is a more sustainable

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
urban mentality?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
According to our research

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
on mental health

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
In fact, we found that

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
there is no

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
linear relationship

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
The higher the density, the better

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
or the lower the density, the better

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
We found that

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
it is a combination

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
of low density

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
and high density

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
In the case of Denmark

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
we found that

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
the risk is relatively low

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It is like

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
a neighborhood in Denmark

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So you can see

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
In this area

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
for the residents

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
it is relatively easy to access

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
public facilities

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
including commercial activities

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
such as coffee shops

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It is also easy to have rest areas

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
such as parks

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
In comparison

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
In Denmark

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
these high density

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
low-rise

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
high-density flat areas

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
When the industrial development of Denmark

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
reached its peak in the 1970s

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
At that time, because of the huge population

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
many houses

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
were built outside the city

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
When they built

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
the design

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
the density

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
of the population was very high

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
but there were no corresponding

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
commercial activities or public facilities

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
In our research

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
we found

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
that

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
in the case of

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
moving houses

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
If the residents

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
moved to

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
high density flat areas

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
If the residents

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
live in such an environment

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
there will be a risk increase

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
In other words

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
compared to the residents

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
of high density flat areas

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
If the residents

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
moved to

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
high density flat areas

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
they will face

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
a higher risk

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
So

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
we are talking about

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
environmental justice

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
or social justice

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
In Denmark

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
there have been a lot of

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
urban renewal cases

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
In the process of urban renewal

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
the city retained

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
or increased the urban green space

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and improved the quality of life

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
At the same time

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
it also increased the rent in the city center

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
In the past

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
the city center of Denmark

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
was mainly for the workers

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
After these places

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
were upgraded

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
when the rent became more expensive

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
some people

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
had to move to

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
lower rents

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
At the same time

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the city council

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
contributed a lot

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
in this study

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
This is a problem

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
that needs to be noticed

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
in urban planning

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
so that we can provide

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
a more fair

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and comfortable

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
living environment

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Finally

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I would like to summarize

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
the position of this study

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
in academic research

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
First of all

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
in the past

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
the researchers

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
mainly looked at the expansion

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
of the city

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
and simplified it

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
into a concept of

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
dual contrast

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
But

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
in addition to

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
the expansion of

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
if we can

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
look at some

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
urban design conditions in more detail

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
such as density and height

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
we will have a chance

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
to talk more

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
in the field of urban planning

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
and talk more about

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
psychological health

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
and other research

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
related to the extension

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
In the second part

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
the position of this study

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
is to use a global

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
method to conduct research

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
The advantage of global technology

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
is that when this method

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
is proposed

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
it can be applied to

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
many other countries

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
At the same time

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
it has a limitation

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
as mentioned earlier

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
because its coverage

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
is very large

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and has a long history

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
so it is actually

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
a relatively limited

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
and difficult topic

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Therefore, through

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
in-depth study

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
we can make progress

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
on this topic

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
This topic is actually

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
very broad

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
It requires a lot of people

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
from different professional backgrounds

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
to join in, including psychology, urban planning

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
and epidemiology

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
So I look forward to

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
discussing more with you

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Finally, I would like to

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
briefly share

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
my next plan

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
I have a fellowship

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
in Yale in the next two years

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
My plan is

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
to expand

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
the three-dimensional

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
urban characteristics

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I just mentioned

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
to the global research area

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Under this global research

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
it is not just

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
the past

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
urban research

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Most of the research areas

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
in Yale

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
are in large cities

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
such as

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
5 million people

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
The scale of the city

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
will receive a lot of research attention

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
However, compared to Taiwan

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
when urban development

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
has reached its peak

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
our urban update

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
may be a street area

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
These small-scale changes

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
or small-scale urban developments

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
in other Latin American countries

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
or even in Africa

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
their urban expansion

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
tend to start

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
from a small change

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
These areas

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
are relatively small

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
and remote

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
so it is hard to be seen by satellites

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Therefore, in the past

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
we did not do much research

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
However, in the future

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
we plan to

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
do more research

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
in this area

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
This is a brief

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
reference

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
for you

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
If you are interested

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
you can read the articles

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
for more details

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
That's all for today

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Let's start the discussion

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Thank you, Chi-Hsing

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
If there are

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
any questions

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
please feel free

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
to raise your mic

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
to join the discussion

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
At the first stage

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
there was a question

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
from Xu Shi-Che

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Do you want to

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
raise your mic

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
to ask Chi-Hsing?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Okay

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Xu Shi-Che

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
seems to say

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
his mic is not working

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Let me ask him

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
his question

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
His question is

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
how much

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
overall accuracy

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
do you need

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
to be able to

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
distinguish

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
your urban

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
development

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
between 6 types of urban

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and 2 types of urban

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
This is a question

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
from the first stage

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
That's a good question

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Because

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
overall accuracy

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
is hard to

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
distinguish

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Overall accuracy

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
is easy to be

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
distinguished

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
by one type

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
We need to

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
look at

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
accuracy matrix

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
In this matrix

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
we can see

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
the top 3 are

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
horizontal

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
and the bottom 3

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
are vertical

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
and horizontal

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
When we

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
look at this

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
we need to

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
look at

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
our own performance

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
When each performance

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
can reach

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
60, 70, 80%

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
then we can

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
distinguish

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Of course 60% is not good

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
But for now

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
we need to be able to

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
distinguish low density

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
houses from

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
non-houses

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It is relatively difficult

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
When we see

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
our own performance

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
we can know

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
how to improve

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
our performance

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Any other questions?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Hello

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I have a question

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
about

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Thank you for your speech

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I think it is very interesting

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
My question is

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
You found that

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
urban conditions

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
are related to

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
residents'

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
mental health

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Although it is not a simple

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
linear relationship

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I am curious

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
At the beginning

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
you mentioned some

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
possible connections

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
For example,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
we can have

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
social activities

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
so that people can

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
get along better

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
But you did not

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
measure it

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
So I am curious

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
What is your

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
imagination

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
about this mechanism

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Do you have any

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
future research

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
to measure it?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I think

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
this question

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I always

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
hear my own answer

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I turn off

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
my microphone

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Thank you

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
In fact, I think

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
when we do quantitative research

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
large scale

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
or big data research

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
we often encounter a limitation

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
that when we talk about

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
this mechanism

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
we can not measure it

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
So when we discuss

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
For example, when we see

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
that Denmark's

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
high-rise buildings are

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
in a low-risk state

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
we will look for

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
documents

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
through interviews

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
or through

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
small scale research

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
to discuss and respond

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
to the document

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
However,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
in my research, I did not

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
measure it

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
In the future,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
is it possible to

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
directly measure social interaction?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
At present,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I see a chance

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
to use social media

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
such as Facebook

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
or Twitter

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
to make improvements

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
in this area

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I am also curious

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Do you have any ideas

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
or suggestions

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I have no special

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I just want to hear

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
your expert opinion

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Because I am also quite interested

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
to know if you want to measure

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
what are the possibilities

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
But I do not know

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
how to do it

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Hello

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I am also doing

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
urban environment and psychological

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
research

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
But I am doing

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
green space

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
We will

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Some say

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
because there is a

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
public space

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
so people will gather

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
and there will be some social interaction

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
There will be

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
social well-being

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
About this

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
public space

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I have a question

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
In our research

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
it will affect

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
mental health

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I want to ask

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
In your future research project

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
will you

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
turn green space

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
into your

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
control variables?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
In Denmark,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
the whole Northern Europe

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
pays a lot of attention to green space

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I have a research

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It is not my research

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
but there is a research in our team

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
It found that in Denmark

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
it uses a standard

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
NDE

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It is from satellite image data

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
to see

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
when children

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
in their childhood

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
How high is the green space

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
for them to adults

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
will extend

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
different psychological

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I found

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
green space is helpful

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
In my own research

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Green space

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
is a hot topic

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
for psychological research

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
My next

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
research

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I will talk about

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
cement

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
architecture

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
and then

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
cross analysis

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
When they are

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
what combination

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
they will do

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
effect analysis

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Hello, I am Zhang Anping

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Sorry, you just asked me

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I thought about it

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I am now

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
You listen to this thing

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
How likely

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
If we use

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
You see

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Google map

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Timeline

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
GPS location

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
plus

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Wi-Fi location

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
to infer

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
a person's behavior

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I am driving

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I am walking

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I am riding a bicycle

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I am running

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
We can infer

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
a person's behavior

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
not on the timeline

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But for the neighbor

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
He comes in

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Quite close

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Walking distance

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
This is a kind of confusion

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Use that way

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
same as

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Satellite system

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Data

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
To model

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Or at least to index

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Different people

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The difference in their behavior

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Then put this as

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
To label them

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Become a link

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Urban design

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Mental health or other

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Well-being index

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Link

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Possibility

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I think it sounds very interesting

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
If you can really get

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
For example, Google is willing to study

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
File and then apply

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Get these users

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
The way you just talked about

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Is it very

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Can break through the current

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I don't know what everyone is doing in this area

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Discussion

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Is that we can really predict

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Some activities and then put the activity

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
What kind of space provides what kind of activity

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Then enter the mental health

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Can talk about this

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Hello

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Yes, I heard that I want to respond

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Just now Zhang Yanping and

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Your research is

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Mainly this information privacy

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Problem

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Because you said before

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
The Danish Health Insurance Bureau's database

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
So it can reflect

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Someone's

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
His illness and residence

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
A timeline

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I think this

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
The feeling of privacy is very

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Very high

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Then you mentioned later

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
You also mentioned in the middle

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
There is positive

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Force to move

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I don't know how you know

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
He is

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
In what situation

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
This is also a personal

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Privacy information

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
You mentioned that you want to put this research

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
To other areas in Denmark

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
For example, you are in the United States now

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Then you feel

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Denmark you get this database

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The completeness of this information

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Those in the United States

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Or in other countries

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Can you get it

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Because it feels very private

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Personal

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Back to the example of Zhang Yanping

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
That is

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Personal

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Personal activity

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
But you still have his

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Information about illness

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Research in this area

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
The question you asked is very important

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Is privacy

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I can share with you

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Denmark

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Denmark

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Their Bureau of Statistics

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
How do they go

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
To ensure that researchers

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Do not hurt

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Privacy

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
The first one is

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
We are in

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Denmark

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Denmark

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Denmark

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Denmark

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Denmark

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Denmark

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Denmark

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Denmark

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Denmark

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Denmark

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Denmark

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Denmark

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Denmark

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Denmark

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Denmark

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Denmark

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Denmark

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Denmark

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Denmark

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Denmark

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Denmark

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Denmark

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Denmark

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Denmark

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Denmark

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Denmark

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Denmark

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Denmark

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Denmark

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Denmark

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Denmark

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Denmark

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Denmark

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
sorry I'm back

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
sorry I'm back

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
can you hear me?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
can you hear me?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
this works, thank you

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
this works, thank you

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I will continue with the

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
reply of the question

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
reply of the question

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
In Denmark

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
the statistics office

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
to use this data

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
first of all

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
this data is anonymous

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and the people above

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
although we will see

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
there is an address code

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
but the address code is not an address

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
just a statistics office

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
behind to connect these

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
reading characteristics with their

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
social and economic attributes, it needs to have a code

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
to connect

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
when we researchers

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
see the data

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
they can't see

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
what the address looks like

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
we only see those that have been

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
linked

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
so above

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
we can't see who the person is

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and we can't see the name of the address

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
or what the name is

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
so we

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
analyze

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
these variable combinations

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
and the statistics

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
and the statistics

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and the statistics

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
and the statistics

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
and the statistics

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
but we can't take any

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
personal information

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
so in this way

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
we can only get a conclusion

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
but we can't

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
in this process

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
leak any personal information

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
what is it

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
the second one you just mentioned

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
how do I know

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
who is forced to move

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and who wants to move

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I don't know

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
in our research

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
we don't actually measure

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
this thing

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
when we respond to documents

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
especially Copenhagen

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
when we respond to documents

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
we find some documents

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
that have been interviewed

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
and they have targeted those

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
recent

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
because of Copenhagen

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and the rent increase

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
including some of the meetings

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and some of the records

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and the records

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and the results

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
and we

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
take this process

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
as a discussion

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and put it in our research

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
and put it in our research

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
and the last question

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
is

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
this kind of research

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
is it possible to be studied in other countries

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
is it possible to be studied in other countries

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
in the US

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I don't know much

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
about US security data

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
but I have some knowledge

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
about Taiwan security data

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
when it comes to Taiwan

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
security data

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it is possible to study

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
psychological health

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and we have ICD

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
so in our security data

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
every year

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
it takes a million people

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
to enter security data

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and these people have their

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
ID

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
but in Taiwan

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
it is different

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
it is limited

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
in living address

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
currently in our security data

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
we can study

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
space information

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the smallest unit is town

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
so we can only

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
study 360 towns

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
in Taiwan

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
but we can't study

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
250 square meters

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
this is what I know

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
do you have any question?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
yes, thank you

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I will ask

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Xu Shizhe

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
about

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
accuracy

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
he said

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
from the picture

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
if we choose

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
deep lab

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
we will sacrifice

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
high accuracy

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
how to

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
overcome this problem?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
this is Xu Shizhe

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I have a question

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
about

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
your second part

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I am curious

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
about the environment

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
will change

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
and the environment

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
how to

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
incorporate

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
these two

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
aspects

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
into your

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
logistic regression model?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
this is my second question

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
thank you

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I will answer

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Xu Shizhe's question

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
indeed

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
when we look at

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
the picture

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
in the lower left

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
indeed

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
compared to

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
the other two models

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the accuracy

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
is lower

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
when we

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
consider this

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
we will consider F1-score

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
simply speaking

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
F1-score needs to

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
measure

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
the balance

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
between different categories

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
if one category

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
is very high

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
the accuracy is very high

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
it means

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
if other categories are low

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
it means this category

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
is often overestimated

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
the model will

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
draw the whole map as tall buildings

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
so that all the tall buildings

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
can be measured

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
but not all of them

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
are tall buildings

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
so other buildings

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
are not drawn

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
the accuracy

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
of F1-score

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
should be

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
balanced

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
this is my first question

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Gao Xian's question

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
is

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
the environment

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
has time and

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
historical changes

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
how to incorporate

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
these two aspects

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
into your research?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I have another

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
question

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
when we

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
track Danes'

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
moving records

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
or their

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
historical record

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
there are two factors

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
that affect their

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
environment

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
one is

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
moving

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
another is

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
in Danish data

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
the main environmental

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
changes are

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
from moving

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
not from

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
fast urban expansion

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
how to incorporate

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
this into

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
logistics?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
in the

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
independent variable

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
that we added

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
in the last

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
five years

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
there is a

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
difference

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
between

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
last five years

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and this year

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
this difference

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
is a variable

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
in our model

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
the result

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
is

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
these five

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
on the left

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
are not only

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
average

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
but also

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
high density

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
if

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
the change

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
is positive

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
it will

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
have a higher

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
contribution

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Gao Xian

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
did I answer

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
your question?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yes

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I am curious

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
if you put them

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
in the model

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
will there be

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
a change

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
or covariance?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yes, there may be

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
a contribution

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
for each model

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
there is a

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
PIF

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
the result is

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
less than 5

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
the contribution is not that obvious

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I believe

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
there must be

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
a change

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
in the model

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
for each model

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
the result is

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
less than 5

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
the contribution is not that obvious

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I believe

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
there must be

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
a change

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
in the model

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
for each model

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
the result is less than

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
5

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
the contribution is not that obvious

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Any other questions?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I have no questions

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Hi

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
My name is Qiao En

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I am a clinical psychologist

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I am interested

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
in urban planning

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
and psychology

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I read a paper

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
about the different functions

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
of land use

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
for those who live in

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
urban areas

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
like Taiwan

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
there are 7 floors

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
1st floor for shops

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
2nd and 3rd floor for residents

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
in this case

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
people are more likely to

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
walk or ride bicycles

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
just like the student

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
who talked about

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
social behavior

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
for those who live in

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
urban areas

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
or high-rise

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
it is not easy

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
for them to walk

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and be healthy

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
because they have to

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
drive everywhere

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
so I am thinking

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
maybe in the future

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
you can change this

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
to land use

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
is it related to

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
people's walking habits

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
yes

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I think

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
it is a good direction

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
in the future

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I am interested

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
in

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
specific

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
like what you said

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
would they

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
want to walk

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
or ride bicycles

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
in the future

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
yes

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I think

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I am working on it

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I think it is interesting

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
it is a new field

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I have not heard of it

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
but it is interesting

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
thank you

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
what are you doing

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I am doing

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
health psychology

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I am doing research

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
about sports

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and mental health

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
urban planning

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
public transportation

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
yes

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I think

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
we can

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
talk more

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
in the future

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
if you are interested

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
we can

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
talk more

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
in the future

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
ok

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
thank you

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
thank you

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
thank you

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
do you have any questions

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
for the audience

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
if you don't have any

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
you can

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
contact

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Cixin

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
later

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
if you have

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
any questions

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
you can

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
contact Cixin

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
privately

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
thank you for your participation

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Cixin also has

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
anything to add

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Cixin

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
no

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
thank you

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
thank you

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
thank you for your participation

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
if you

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
haven't joined

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Project TIRA

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I have posted the application form

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
in the chat room

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
if you are interested

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
you can join

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
thank you for your participation

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I will turn off the recording

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
if you

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
don't want to be in the recording

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
you can stay

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
after I turn off the recording
