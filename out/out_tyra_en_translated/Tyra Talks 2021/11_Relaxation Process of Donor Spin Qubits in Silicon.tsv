0	16000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on November 14th.
16000	21000	We are honored to have Yuli Xue as our speaker today.
21000	33000	She is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New South Wales.
33000	38000	Her doctoral program is at Purdue University, EECS.
38000	48000	Her research focuses on physics and the defects in semiconductors.
48000	54000	Her research focuses on simulation, but has a close relationship with experiments.
54000	64000	Today's topic is the relaxation process of donor spin-tubing in silica.
64000	81000	Before we get started, let's give Yuli a round of applause.
81000	90000	Now we will hand over to Yuli.
90000	100000	Today I will be talking about how to use donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.
100000	107000	And how the relaxation process plays an important role.
107000	110000	There are five parts to this talk.
110000	116000	The first part is about quantum computing.
116000	124000	There are many different types of quantum computing.
124000	130000	Some people use superconducting qubits, others use topological qubits.
130000	135000	Today I will focus on semiconductor qubits.
135000	143000	I will be using donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.
143000	148000	Next I will talk about spin relaxation.
148000	152000	What does it have to do with quantum computing?
152000	158000	How does it help to calculate spin relaxation time?
158000	164000	Next I will talk about how to calculate spin relaxation time.
164000	179000	Lastly, I will talk about the results of the experiment.
179000	186000	The first part is about quantum computing.
186000	192000	What are the differences between classical and quantum computers?
192000	198000	For classical qubits, you can only choose either 0 or 1.
198000	202000	For quantum qubits, you can choose either 0 or 1.
202000	210000	This means that when you operate on quantum qubits, you can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.
210000	215000	If you only have a single qubit, it doesn't seem very powerful.
216000	224000	However, if you have two qubits, you can operate on four states.
224000	229000	Quantum computers can operate on these four states at the same time.
229000	237000	If you have n qubits, you can operate on 2n qubits at the same time.
237000	240000	This is very powerful.
240000	248000	If you want to solve the riddle, you can try the first method.
248000	251000	If it doesn't work, you can try the second method.
251000	254000	If it doesn't work, you can try the third method.
254000	257000	Quantum computers can try 100 methods at a time.
257000	263000	Quantum computers can solve complex problems in a short time.
263000	266000	Quantum computers can be used widely.
266000	275000	For example, data security, database search, quantum chemistry, or machine learning.
275000	285000	Next, I will introduce the most basic unit of quantum computers.
285000	291000	Quantum computers are mainly composed of 0 and 1 like classical qubits.
291000	298000	Quantum computers can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.
298000	302000	We use the block sphere as a representation.
302000	310000	Quantum computers can not only operate on two qubits, but also on a channel or other points.
310000	313000	This information is very important.
313000	321000	Quantum computers can use quantum operators such as linear or horizontal derivatives.
321000	327000	Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron spin, downspin, offspin, nuclear spin, or upspin, downspin.
327000	337000	Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron ground state and first excited state.
337000	345000	For example, if we take electron spin as an example,
345000	350000	1 is upspin, 0 is downspin.
350000	354000	This is our single qubit.
354000	358000	First, we need to add magnetic field.
358000	365000	Electron spin is a magnet.
365000	371000	When it is parallel to the magnetic field or in the opposite direction, its energy will be different.
371000	376000	When the energy of the magnetic field is split, the two states are separated.
376000	383000	If we want to operate electron spin, we can add an AC magnetic field.
383000	392000	If the frequency of the AC magnetic field and the energy of the AC magnetic field are matched,
392000	395000	a resonance will occur.
395000	405000	The resonance will go from 1 to 0, then to 1, then to 0, then to 1.
405000	417000	The definition of qubit operation is the time evolution of two coherent states.
417000	423000	For example, we can measure the qubit after a certain period of time.
423000	429000	We will find that the qubit is originally in state 1, but after a certain period of time, it becomes 0.
429000	434000	In this way, we can realize the NOT gate in logic design.
434000	437000	1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1.
437000	441000	This is our single qubit operation.
441000	447000	If we have two qubits, the most famous gate is called CNOT gate.
447000	453000	CNOT gate means that when we have control qubit, control bit and target bit,
453000	460000	when the control bit is 0, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.
460000	470000	When the control bit is 1, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.
470000	472000	This is CNOT gate.
472000	475000	How to use electron spin?
475000	482000	There is an interaction between two electron spins called exchange interaction.
483000	490000	If they work, it means that when the control spin is in the up spin and it is in the down spin,
490000	494000	the effect of the second electron spin is different.
494000	496000	How is it different?
496000	502000	For example, when you turn to this channel, the speed of the precessed channel will be different.
502000	508000	For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.
508000	516000	When you measure, the spin is still in the down spin.
516000	525000	But in this case, because the control spin is different from the other direction,
525000	527000	the spin turns faster.
527000	532000	Because of the interaction, the spin turns faster.
533000	536000	For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.
536000	538000	When you measure, the spin is in the up spin.
538000	540000	Originally, the spin is in the down spin, but now it is in the up spin.
540000	542000	One spin is not changed, and the other spin is changed.
542000	546000	This is how CNOT gate is realized.
546000	550000	If we have a single qubit gate and CNOT gate,
550000	554000	we can do quantum computation,
554000	559000	which is to realize a universal quantum computation.
559000	565000	Next, we will introduce the donor spin qubit.
565000	571000	For example, we need an electron spin to store 0 and 1.
571000	575000	But we need to localize the electron spin.
575000	578000	For example, there are so many electrons in silicon solid.
578000	581000	How do we know which one we want to control?
582000	592000	The concept is that the silicon and the phosphorus are next to each other.
592000	597000	One has 14 electrons, and the other has 15 electrons.
597000	605000	When you take out a silicon and replace it with phosphorus,
605000	608000	it will have one more electron.
609000	617000	In this way, the electron will go around the sphere.
617000	626000	The premise is that the electron will not run away at low temperature.
626000	629000	If it is at high temperature, it will run away when the energy is high.
629000	634000	This is our main structure.
634000	637000	The advantage is that the strain is very small.
637000	640000	It does not squeeze to the side.
640000	646000	Because they are next to each other, the quality is very close.
648000	653000	In 1998, Bruce Kane proposed this proposal.
653000	658000	He said that he wanted to put phosphorus in a certain position,
658000	666000	confine an electron, and use it as a quantum computer.
666000	672000	First, we need to encode 0 and 1 in the electron's up-spin and down-spin,
672000	677000	or in the donor's up-spin and down-spin, or in the nuclear's up-spin and down-spin.
677000	680000	Next, we need a low temperature.
680000	685000	This way, the electron will run around here.
686000	694000	How do we realize the single-qubit gate and the two-qubit gate?
694000	698000	For the single-qubit gate, we can use the magnetic field of the AC.
698000	701000	We try to have resonance with it.
701000	705000	The resonance frequency can be controlled by the gate above.
705000	710000	For example, if the gate is positive, the electron will be sucked up.
710000	713000	In this way, the resonance frequency will change.
713000	719000	When the electron is sucked up, the distance between it and the nucleus is large,
719000	721000	and the interaction between them is small.
721000	724000	The interaction will affect the resonance frequency.
724000	728000	In this way, for example,
728000	736000	if the two-qubit gate is coupled with a different bias,
736000	740000	the two-qubit gate will have different resonance frequencies.
740000	744000	If we only want to operate the left-hand qubit,
744000	754000	we can tune the magnetic field of the AC to match the resonance frequency.
754000	760000	At this time, only the left-hand qubit will rotate,
760000	763000	and the right-hand qubit will not be affected.
763000	769000	In this way, we can operate the left-hand qubit or the right-hand qubit.
769000	773000	As for the two-qubit gate,
773000	779000	as mentioned earlier, the two electrons will have an exchange interaction.
779000	786000	If the J-gate in the middle does not turn on,
786000	790000	the two qubits will not interact.
790000	794000	Their interaction is very weak.
794000	799000	For example, if I add a qubit and suck two electrons in the middle,
799000	802000	their wave function overlap will be very large,
802000	804000	and their interaction will be very strong.
804000	806000	Then we can do the so-called C-knot gate.
806000	821000	Can you tell me how much is the ionization energy of this electron?
821000	825000	Or if you can use the photon frequency,
825000	832000	and what is the energy of the splitting next to it?
832000	839000	First of all, the ionization energy is 45.6 mEV.
839000	844000	So mEV is about gigahertz,
844000	847000	which is about this range.
848000	853000	For the Zeeman splitting,
853000	860000	the Zeeman splitting of the electron is also about 0.1 to 1 mEV.
860000	865000	If your magnetic field is between 1 Tesla to 10 Tesla,
865000	870000	your Zeeman splitting is also in the range of gigahertz.
870000	872000	If it is a nuclear spin,
872000	878000	then the Zeeman splitting will be about 1000 times smaller.
878000	883000	Don't tell me that your temperature is 100 mC.
883000	885000	Isn't that a bit too high?
885000	891000	Your thermal radiation seems to be in this range.
891000	895000	Too high.
895000	897000	Because if it is 1K,
897000	899000	it is about 100 gigahertz.
899000	901000	So if it is 100 mC,
901000	903000	it is about 10 gigahertz.
903000	905000	A little higher than you.
905000	908000	Isn't that too high?
908000	925000	You mean the energy difference is too small, right?
925000	927000	No, I mean,
927000	931000	in the environment of 100 mC photon bath,
931000	936000	all your states can be randomized.
936000	939000	Or you can analyze them directly.
939000	943000	Sorry.
943000	944000	Wait a minute.
944000	947000	Ted, your microphone is on.
947000	951000	There seems to be some noise over there.
951000	954000	Can you mute it directly?
954000	959000	Okay, I will mute it directly.
959000	961000	You can continue to discuss.
961000	965000	You mean photon or phonon?
965000	967000	Photon.
967000	969000	I just want to know
969000	972000	where is your operating energy scale now.
972000	976000	So what is the temperature of your environment
976000	982000	to become the so-called environment without interference?
982000	986000	There should be no photon here.
986000	990000	No, there are photons everywhere, right?
990000	992000	It should be phonon.
992000	994000	But it is phonon.
994000	997000	It should be phonon.
997000	1001000	No, even if you are in the cryostat,
1001000	1005000	there will be thermal radiation if there is temperature.
1005000	1007000	Right?
1007000	1009000	Yes.
1009000	1013000	Otherwise, how do you define vacuum temperature?
1013000	1017000	Thermal radiation.
1017000	1021000	This is what the theorists are talking about now.
1021000	1025000	In the end, there may be real problems in the experiment.
1025000	1030000	We will see its performance later.
1030000	1033000	Okay, let me see if I can finish later.
1033000	1037000	Actually, I am quite curious about the different approaches.
1037000	1043000	For example, what is the difference between the cryostat and the constraint?
1043000	1045000	I am mainly curious about this.
1045000	1049000	Sorry, I am not sure if I can answer your question.
1049000	1051000	But we can discuss it later.
1051000	1053000	Okay, we can discuss it later.
1053000	1055000	Thank you.
1055000	1057000	I have a question here.
1057000	1059000	Hello.
1059000	1061000	Hi.
1061000	1063000	I have a question.
1063000	1067000	I think B and TESLA are quite big.
1067000	1071000	Why are they so different?
1071000	1075000	Why are they so different?
1075000	1077000	Yes.
1077000	1081000	The first B is for z-splitting.
1081000	1085000	The first B is for z-splitting.
1085000	1089000	It is connected to the resonance frequency.
1089000	1092140	It is connected to the resonance frequency.
1092140	1097900	It shows how much the AC magnetic field is.
1097900	1100900	However, its strength is different.
1100900	1108900	Its strength is depend on the Robeot oscillation.
1109000	1111900	But, its strength is quite slow eventually.
1111900	1116000	You don't have to be fast to use Robeot oscillation.
1116000	1118000	Because
1118000	1126000	So, your BAC will correspond to the size of the off-diagonal term.
1126000	1128000	Yes.
1128000	1130000	What is B?
1130000	1134000	B is the size of the Zeeman speeding.
1134000	1136000	It is the inch gap.
1136000	1138000	Yes.
1138000	1140000	Ok.
1140000	1142000	I am curious.
1142000	1144000	Why don't you need to use Robeot oscillation?
1144000	1148000	I am not sure how much T1 and T2 are in this system.
1148000	1150000	Can you tell me the number?
1150000	1155000	Why don't you want the quantum gate to be faster?
1155000	1158000	I am a little bit surprised.
1158000	1160000	Ok.
1160000	1170000	I am not sure how short the measurement time is.
1170000	1175000	Theoretically, T1 and T2 should be faster.
1175000	1180000	But, I am not sure what is the limitation in the experiment.
1180000	1185000	So, maybe I am wrong.
1185000	1189000	T1 and T2 should be faster.
1189000	1196000	However, T1 is a few seconds.
1196000	1200000	T2 is a few seconds.
1200000	1202000	I don't have a good number.
1202000	1204000	However,
1204000	1224000	the applied AC magnetic field allows Robeot oscillation to reach 10 nanoseconds.
1224000	1229000	So, it is pretty fast.
1229000	1231000	Thank you.
1231000	1233000	Ok.
1233000	1235000	I am sorry.
1235000	1237000	I can comment on this.
1237000	1239000	In the experiment,
1239000	1245000	the time resolution is about 1 nanosecond.
1245000	1247000	It is the shortest.
1247000	1249000	It is the shortest.
1249000	1251000	Ok. Thank you.
1251000	1253000	I am sorry.
1253000	1255000	Let me interrupt you.
1255000	1259000	Please tell us your name and
1259000	1263000	briefly introduce yourself.
1263000	1265000	Thank you.
1265000	1267000	Ok.
1267000	1269000	So,
1269000	1271000	I will continue.
1271000	1273000	So,
1273000	1278000	we want to realize the proposal using STM technique.
1278000	1280000	What is STM technique?
1280000	1284000	You have a scanning tunneling microscope tip.
1284000	1293000	You can remove the silicon in a certain position.
1293000	1296000	Then, you can dope phosphorus in this position.
1296000	1299000	This is actually a very difficult technique.
1299000	1303000	In the past, we doped silicon in a more random way.
1303000	1309000	We did not particularly control where the phosphorus atom should be placed.
1309000	1315000	This scanning tunneling microscope technique can control this.
1315000	1318000	It controls this variable.
1318000	1320000	So,
1320000	1324000	Michelle Siemens Group
1324000	1327000	at UNSW
1327000	1330000	made a device that looks like this.
1330000	1334000	The gate and donor are made using STM.
1334000	1336000	So,
1336000	1340000	the gate is removed and the donor is placed.
1340000	1346000	You can control the shape of the gate and the donor.
1346000	1350000	Another difficult part is
1350000	1356000	to load and read the electrons on the donor.
1356000	1359000	In 2010,
1359000	1361000	Andrew Marlowe
1362000	1369000	used STM to control the Fermi level of the SCT.
1369000	1374000	This allows the electrons to be tunneled to the SCT
1374000	1378000	or from the SCT tunnel to the donor.
1378000	1384000	When the Fermi level of the SCT is
1384000	1389000	in the middle of the upspin and downspin,
1389000	1393000	only the upspin electrons can be tunneled to the SCT.
1393000	1397000	The downspin electrons cannot be tunneled to the SCT.
1397000	1401000	So, if you measure the current peak,
1401000	1405000	the electrons are on the upspin.
1405000	1407000	If you do not measure anything,
1407000	1411000	the electrons are on the downspin.
1411000	1415000	Then we can measure the electron spin.
1415000	1417000	So,
1417000	1419000	in 1998,
1419000	1422000	Ken proposed this proposal.
1422000	1426000	In 2010,
1426000	1430000	Andrew Marlowe did the electron spin readout.
1430000	1432000	In 2015,
1432000	1437000	he did the single-qubit gate operation.
1437000	1439000	In 2019,
1439000	1443000	he did the two-qubit gate operation.
1443000	1445000	Now,
1445000	1451000	we are going to build a large-scale quantum computer.
1451000	1455000	Sorry, can I interrupt?
1455000	1457000	I'm Ted.
1457000	1459000	Sure.
1459000	1462000	You just talked about the readout.
1462000	1465000	Can you tell us about the single-qubit gate in the middle?
1465000	1470000	Which electron does it send to the AC field?
1470000	1472000	It should be ESR.
1472000	1474000	Yes, it is ESR.
1474000	1476000	Well,
1476000	1478000	it is...
1478000	1480000	Well,
1480000	1484000	it is...
1484000	1486000	If it is ESR,
1486000	1488000	there is...
1488000	1490000	I did not draw it here.
1490000	1492000	There is a global...
1492000	1494000	There is a global...
1494000	1496000	There is a global...
1496000	1498000	There is a global...
1499000	1503000	You can produce a globalized AC field
1503000	1506000	and control it.
1506000	1508000	But there is no...
1508000	1510000	But there is no...
1510000	1514000	It is a top-gate or back-gate.
1514000	1516000	It is not a...
1516000	1518000	It is not a...
1518000	1520000	It is not a...
1520000	1522000	It is not a...
1522000	1526000	It is not a...
1526000	1529000	What are the advantages of the donor spin qubit?
1529000	1534000	First, it has a long coherence time.
1534000	1536000	For example,
1536000	1538000	the natural silicon is silicon 28.
1538000	1540000	The nuclear spin is 0.
1540000	1542000	It means
1542000	1546000	only the donor's nuclear spin and the electron's nuclear spin are not 0.
1546000	1551000	Most of the other spins have no interaction.
1551000	1553000	For example,
1553000	1555000	it has a long coherence time.
1555000	1557000	It has a clear boundary.
1557000	1559000	For example,
1559000	1561000	if you have a phosphorus donor,
1561000	1563000	it looks the same.
1563000	1565000	It is very helpful to scale up.
1565000	1567000	Next,
1567000	1569000	the semiconductor industry
1569000	1571000	has a very mature technology for silicon.
1571000	1573000	It can be applied later.
1573000	1575000	It can be applied later.
1575000	1577000	The disadvantage is
1577000	1579000	the STM technology
1579000	1581000	The disadvantage is
1581000	1583000	the STM technology
1613000	1615000	We need to control it very carefully.
1615000	1617000	We need to control it very carefully.
1617000	1619000	We don't know this.
1619000	1621000	We don't know this.
1621000	1623000	It is not good.
1623000	1625000	Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.
1625000	1627000	Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.
1627000	1629000	Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.
1629000	1631000	Next,
1631000	1633000	I have a question.
1633000	1635000	I want to introduce myself.
1635000	1637000	I am Zhang Yuanyong.
1637000	1639000	I am a high-performance physicist.
1639000	1641000	I am a high-performance physicist.
1641640	1643000	Before you works
1643000	1645000	Before you works
1645000	1647000	before you repairs in the future,
1647000	1649000	before you repairs in the future,
1649000	1651000	How clean does vapor look?
1651000	1653000	How clean does vapor look?
1653000	1655000	Can we buy it?
1655000	1657400	Yes,
1657400	1659000	we just mentioned
1659000	1661000	we just mentioned
1661000	1663000	the natural silicon is still
1663000	1665000	5% silicon-29
1665000	1667000	The silicon-29 means
1667000	1669000	there is a nuclear spin.
1669000	1671000	So,
1671000	1673000	the trend is
1673000	1675000	to use purified silicon
1675000	1677000	to minimize the silicon-29
1677000	1679000	to minimize the silicon-29
1679000	1681000	So, the requirement is quite high.
1681000	1683000	So, the requirement is quite high.
1683000	1685000	I have a follow-up question
1685000	1687000	I have a follow-up question
1687000	1689000	Is the purified silicon commercially available?
1689000	1691000	Is the purified silicon commercially available?
1691000	1693000	Or do we need to make it specially?
1693000	1695000	I think we need to make it
1695000	1697000	with a special factory
1697000	1699000	not a mass production
1699000	1701000	not a mass production
1701000	1703000	I'm not sure
1703000	1705000	but it seems like this
1705000	1707000	Ok, thank you
1707000	1709000	Ok, thank you
1709000	1711000	Ok, next I will introduce
1711000	1713000	what is spin relaxation
1713000	1715000	what is spin relaxation
1715000	1717000	What is the importance of spin relaxation
1717000	1719000	What is the importance of spin relaxation
1719000	1721000	or T1 time?
1721000	1723000	First, if you load an electron
1723000	1725000	and you want to read out
1725000	1727000	If you load in up spin
1727000	1729000	then it should be in up spin
1729000	1731000	if you read out
1731000	1733000	If it relaxes in this process
1733000	1735000	If it relaxes in this process
1735000	1737000	from up spin to down spin
1737000	1739000	you will have an error
1739000	1741000	a read out error
1741000	1743000	This error is quite fatal
1743000	1745000	This error is quite fatal
1745000	1747000	We need a lot of design
1747000	1749000	We need a lot of design
1749000	1751000	If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer
1751000	1753000	If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer
1753000	1755000	can handle this error
1755000	1757000	can handle this error
1757000	1757760	The current design is
1757760	1759000	The current design is
1759000	1761000	In the case of fidelity
1761000	1763000	99%
1763000	1765000	So we hope
1765000	1767000	in the case of fidelity
1767000	1769000	99%
1769000	1771000	so we hope
1771000	1773000	that the longer the spin relaxation time
1773000	1775000	that the longer the spin relaxation time
1775000	1777000	the longer the spin relaxation time
