00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,460
Hello everyone, welcome to today's lecture on July 31st, Project HIRA. Today is a special event in the summer, and we would like to invite Professor Tu-Ming Feng, who is now at the University of Westlake.

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:34,460
His main research focuses on the theory of quantum physics. He is interested in low-dimensional materials, transport phenomena, and the topological phase of matter.

3
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:48,460
Although he is a theorist, he also likes to cooperate with experimentalists to realize his theories.

4
00:00:48,460 --> 00:01:05,460
Another important thing is that he is also very interested in scientific education, so he hopes that today's lecture can bring us some gains.

5
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,460
Today's lecture is mainly about the teaching of the scientific diagram and Illustrator.

6
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:23,460
I hope that in this lecture, we can learn the importance of the scientific diagram, the thinking process, and how to use Illustrator.

7
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,460
Let's give Professor Tu-Ming Feng the floor.

8
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:43,460
Hello everyone, this is my first time to give a lecture on Project HIRA, so please bear with me if there are any lags.

9
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:54,460
Today, I will talk about the scientific diagram and how to use Illustrator to realize the scientific diagram.

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:11,460
The scientific diagram is a very big topic, so I will talk about it in detail, but I will try to make it easy for you to understand.

11
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
Illustrator is a bigger topic.

12
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:24,460
At that time, I studied Illustrator for about two months, and I studied two nights a week and three hours a night.

13
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:33,460
At that time, I studied Illustrator in a classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional class for advertising students.

14
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:42,460
At that time, I studied Illustrator in a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University.

15
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,460
Basically, you take a picture and use Illustrator to copy it completely.

16
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,460
So we do this kind of practice every week.

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,460
We will practice from a small lamp to an apple.

18
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,460
But when I was studying for my Ph.D., I had to draw a lot of pictures.

19
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Especially when I did a lot of scientific education, I had to talk to the general public about some difficult quantum problems or some difficult physics problems.

20
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,460
At this time, you have to draw a good picture to help them.

21
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,460
But this kind of picture only needs some basic functions of Illustrator.

22
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
You don't need advanced functions.

23
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,460
So today I will introduce these basic functions and help you get started.

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,460
At the end, I will give you some videos.

25
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:39,460
If you practice according to these videos, you will probably understand how to use Illustrator by drawing five to ten pictures.

26
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Then you can move on from there.

27
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,460
If you have any questions later, you can leave a message in the chat.

28
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,460
So this is my routine today.

29
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,460
I want to tell you first that the science team is very subjective.

30
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Some people think this picture is beautiful, some people think that picture is beautiful.

31
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,460
What I'm talking about today is mainly my subjective opinion and experience.

32
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:17,460
It's also my experience of helping people change articles for so many years.

33
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,460
So if you have a different idea, you are welcome to leave it in the comments.

34
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm sure a lot of people have the same opinion as you.

35
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Okay, the concept of scientific drawing.

36
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,460
When we start talking about the concept of scientific drawing, I need you to start imagining.

37
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,460
How do you draw a picture based on your recent article or article you just wrote?

38
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Usually, as a scientist, you start with a PhD.

39
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,460
First, you will do a lot of research.

40
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,460
After the research, you may write a paper.

41
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
After writing the paper, you have to give a speech everywhere.

42
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,460
So when you want to present to others, you mainly write articles and give speeches.

43
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,460
The purpose of these two parts is also very different.

44
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,460
But whether it's an article or a speech, it basically has some components.

45
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,460
That is, there are words, pictures, and charts.

46
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,460
But every article has words, pictures, and charts.

47
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,460
But what kind of scientific article do you think is good to read?

48
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,460
I believe when you read other people's literature, you read other people's papers.

49
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,460
So sometimes you think, why is this article so difficult to read?

50
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Why did I read this paragraph 10 times and still not understand it?

51
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Or why when I went to listen to the slideshow,

52
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,460
there were people who did experiments for 20 minutes and showed you 100 slides.

53
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,460
Then you don't understand what the slides are talking about.

54
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,460
So sometimes you think a certain article is particularly difficult to read, particularly difficult to understand.

55
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Or some slideshows, some presentations, you may fall asleep after 10 minutes.

56
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,460
This kind of thing means that this article or this is not necessarily your problem.

57
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,460
But a lot of times, this presenter or this author,

58
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,460
his article or his slideshow is a bit problematic.

59
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,460
So his slideshow or this article is not so easy to read.

60
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,460
So what is a good scientific article?

61
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,460
There are basically four concepts.

62
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,460
I'll give you a lot of examples of these four concepts later.

63
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,460
Let you understand what these four concepts mean.

64
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,460
Because I've been talking about this for a long time.

65
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,460
Okay, first of all, this article has to be very clear.

66
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,460
You're writing a scientific article.

67
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
What is my experiment?

68
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
What is my method?

69
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,460
And how did I do it?

70
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
What is my final result?

71
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
What does this result mean?

72
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
And what does that mean?

73
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
And how do I get from this meaning?

74
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Go down and do more discussion.

75
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,460
It should be a very clear, very clear thing.

76
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
What about your English sentence?

77
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
We usually hope it's a simple sentence.

78
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,460
You don't want to use too many complicated sentences.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
And then there's a lot, a lot of words.

80
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
That's not good.

81
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,460
The simplest thing is that you have to be very clear.

82
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Write down the whole story of the fact you're doing research.

83
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
What about this story?

84
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,460
In addition to writing it down very clearly,

85
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,460
You have to have a very, very strict logic between each component.

86
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
That's why this one is going to take this paragraph.

87
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,460
There should be a reason for this.

88
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
So when you write an article,

89
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,460
It's not going to make people think, oh, I said A, and then I said B.

90
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
But there's a jump between A and B.

91
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
I don't know why I'm talking about B.

92
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
I don't know what A is.

93
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
Transition to B.

94
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,460
I'll just say A and B.

95
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,460
That's not good.

96
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,460
This is what you see a lot in a lot of presentations.

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,460
The third one is precise.

98
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,460
What kind of experiment are you telling people?

99
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,460
If it's a paper, if it's a presentation,

100
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
You can talk very long and wait for people to ask questions.

101
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
But if you're a paper, you have to make it very clear.

102
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,460
For example, what are some of your control variables?

103
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
What temperature are you doing?

104
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,460
You just have to find a corner in the paper.

105
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
It's all about the narrative.

106
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
It's all very precise.

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
What about your inference?

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,460
You have to be very, very precise with your words, especially your verbs.

109
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,460
For example, this thing is what I guess.

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Or is this thing going to be like this?

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Is this cause and effect relationship very absolute?

112
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Or is it 80%?

113
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
Is it possible to have a relationship?

114
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
Maybe it doesn't matter.

115
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Or is this completely my guess?

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,460
This kind of verb theory,

117
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,460
You have to be very precise with your words.

118
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,460
Okay, and then the fourth one.

119
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
The important thing is that this article is easy to read.

120
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,460
You can write it very clearly, very precise.

121
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
But sometimes it's just not that easy to read.

122
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Or people don't want to read the first time they see it.

123
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,460
For example, some articles are very well written,

124
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Then people don't want to read it.

125
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,460
So you still have to readability.

126
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,460
The first three are basically the skills you have to tell the story.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,460
This is another topic.

128
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
What about the picture?

129
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,460
The main thing is to strengthen the readability.

130
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
It's beautiful and easy to read.

131
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
This is the biggest use of the picture.

132
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
So every time you draw a picture,

133
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,460
This picture must add points to your article.

134
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,460
The bonus part is that it makes people feel attractive and want to read it.

135
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Then you can use very clear materials.

136
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
What are you studying?

137
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,460
So let's take a look.

138
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
A good scientific article or video.

139
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,460
What kind of pictures do you think will be helpful to the audience?

140
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Then I'll try it.

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
You can all use the speech function, right?

142
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,460
I want you to give me some examples.

143
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:59,460
What kind of pictures do you choose to put on your paper?

144
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Any ideas?

145
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Let's ask for three volunteers.

146
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Let's check if everyone is listening.

147
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Do you want to talk about it first?

148
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Me?

149
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,460
I think it's important to have a process.

150
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
There's a process, right?

151
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Or push down the process.

152
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
Like a process diagram.

153
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I think my first picture will be

154
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
In my experiment,

155
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,460
It's a more innovative part.

156
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,460
It's a more innovative part.

157
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Enlarge it and put it there.

158
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,460
Then the second one is the entire experimental framework.

159
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,460
It's innovative, right?

160
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,460
And then put an experimental framework or process diagram.

161
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
And then the last one is the data.

162
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
The last one is the data.

163
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Anyone else want to add?

164
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
We already have three.

165
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
Okay.

166
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Today we're talking about these three pictures, right?

167
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm going to talk about exactly these three pictures today.

168
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
It's a process diagram.

169
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Because we just talked about simple and easy to understand.

170
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
Or beautiful and easy to understand.

171
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
What is readability?

172
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Readability is that you want people to want to read.

173
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,460
So we're going to have an innovative picture.

174
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,460
What's the most innovative and different idea in your experiment?

175
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
This picture is usually very beautiful.

176
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,460
And then put it on the first page.

177
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
Because if you make this picture beautiful and put it on the first page,

178
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
It's easy to be selected as the cover of the magazine.

179
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
Okay.

180
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,460
So this innovative picture is not the same as your other data pictures.

181
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
I'll show you later.

182
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
What is an innovative picture?

183
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
And then the second one is.

184
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,460
Almost doing experiments or doing a lot of social studies.

185
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Or the theory will have a process diagram.

186
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
How do you do this experiment?

187
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
How is your instrument exactly layered?

188
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
So this is how we have a process diagram.

189
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,460
The process diagram will make it easy for people to understand.

190
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Because if you want to describe your instrument,

191
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
But if you use all the text, you'll say,

192
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Okay, I'm going to put A material on top of this material.

193
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,460
C material, B material, C material, 9 cm, D material, 10 cm.

194
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,460
If you're using text, you might have to be naked.

195
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I just said that for a whole page.

196
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,460
You can't describe an instrument well.

197
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,460
But you just need to put a little picture.

198
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,460
He can put everything you just said on top of it.

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
This is the most powerful part of the picture.

200
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,460
So you think if you talk about a page of things, you can use a picture to replace it.

201
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
You have to change that picture.

202
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Even if there's no data in that picture.

203
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,460
But he can replace so many words.

204
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,460
It's worth being put on.

205
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
So this is the process diagram.

206
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
Okay.

207
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
But if you can finish your process in one sentence,

208
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
You don't need to put this picture on.

209
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Because it's a waste of space.

210
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,460
And then the last one is the data picture.

211
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,460
You may have been doing experiments for several years.

212
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,460
The most important thing is the data, right?

213
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,460
So we're going to put the data picture in there, too.

214
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,460
So the data picture should be more straightforward.

215
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,460
Okay, so we're going to talk about these three.

216
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,460
So let's take a look at the scientific picture.

217
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Of course, I can tell you what kind of picture it is.

218
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Basically, it's a good picture.

219
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
So what kind of picture is a good picture?

220
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
What kind of picture is a bad picture?

221
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Let's take a look at it first.

222
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
What do you think of this picture?

223
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Let's say this is the current situation of Kobe.

224
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,460
And then some people are not infected.

225
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
There are so many people who are not infected.

226
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,460
And then some people are infected with no symptoms.

227
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,460
Some people are infected with symptoms.

228
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Let's criticize this picture.

229
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,460
From the criticism, you can slowly increase your beauty.

230
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,460
What do you think is the biggest problem with this picture?

231
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
There are too few people who are infected.

232
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,460
There are too few people who are infected with symptoms.

233
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,460
You can't see it on the picture.

234
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah, you can barely see this, right?

235
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
So you can barely see this picture.

236
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
What's the purpose of this picture?

237
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
I want people to compare and see how much this is.

238
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
But this is so little.

239
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
This original picture is a failure.

240
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
You just can't see it.

241
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Let me talk about some suggestions in the chat.

242
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,460
He said there is no main title.

243
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Does that mean there is no title?

244
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
No title.

245
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
And Ray said there is no value.

246
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,460
No value, that's right.

247
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
And Chi-Chi said...

248
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
It's ugly. Why do you want an original picture?

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
You can just use this one.

251
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,460
Okay.

252
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
So everyone can see the point, right?

253
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,460
This picture doesn't have any bonus points.

254
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
This picture only contains three pieces of information.

255
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,460
Basically, I don't know how many people are infected.

256
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,460
And we don't know their numbers.

257
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
So basically, this picture tells us only one piece of information.

258
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
There are a lot of people who are not infected.

259
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
That's it.

260
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,460
And the sentence I just said can literally be used in one sentence.

261
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
One sentence is the end.

262
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Why do I have to spend so much time to say one sentence to end it?

263
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
So it's not necessary.

264
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
This picture can be removed.

265
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
I can just write one sentence.

266
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
80% of people are not infected.

267
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,460
15% of people are not infected.

268
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
I can just finish this sentence.

269
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
So the biggest problem with this picture is that

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,460
in addition to not precise and no bonus points,

271
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
it shouldn't exist at all.

272
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,460
This is a picture I made up.

273
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
But the biggest problem with this picture is that

274
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
it shouldn't exist at all.

275
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
It doesn't make sense at all.

276
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
OK.

277
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,460
So everyone actually has some aesthetics.

278
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,460
Let's take a look at this picture.

279
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
What do you think is wrong with this picture?

280
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,460
You can also write it in the chat.

281
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
OK.

282
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
William said the font is too small.

283
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
The font is too small.

284
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
That's right.

285
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,460
Usually, very experienced scientists

286
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,460
will know the font size

287
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,460
as soon as they see the article.

288
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Then they will know that the font is too small.

289
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,460
It doesn't mark what each line is.

290
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,460
What is the line of different shapes?

291
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,460
What is it?

292
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
That's right.

293
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
It doesn't have a legend at all, does it?

294
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
That's right.

295
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
OK.

296
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Did you find that the picture below looks empty?

297
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
But there is actually data below.

298
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,460
This data is just very close to zero.

299
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Oh.

300
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Did you find that?

301
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Yes, like this picture,

302
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
you either make it log,

303
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
that is, semi-log 2,

304
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,460
or you have to zoom out as much as possible.

305
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
If it's all zero,

306
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
you don't have to draw at all.

307
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Just write it all as zero.

308
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,460
That's it.

309
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Yes, everyone has started to catch a point.

310
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Of course, we will...

311
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I usually...

312
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
You'll know later.

313
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
I'll tell you more in detail later.

314
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,460
For example, this triangle is too small.

315
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
It's too small compared to this one.

316
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,460
And then this title.

317
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,460
This is the X, Y axis.

318
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,460
We usually use text.

319
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Try to avoid using delta P or T.

320
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Try not to use symbols.

321
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Try to use good things.

322
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
OK.

323
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
This picture...

324
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
Every picture I'm showing now

325
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
can be found on paper.

326
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
These are all already published papers.

327
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,460
This is also a paper that has already been published.

328
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,460
What do you think of this picture?

329
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Is it not necessary to be three-dimensional?

330
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Does it want to be three-dimensional?

331
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
That's right.

332
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
Once upon a time,

333
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
when people just started to draw three-dimensional pictures,

334
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
they thought it was cool.

335
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
So they wanted to draw three-dimensional pictures of everything.

336
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Especially the round cake picture.

337
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.

338
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Then the tree-shaped picture.

339
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Then this kind of picture.

340
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.

341
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
But you see, this three-dimensional picture

342
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
has no extra points at all.

343
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
And it's very ugly.

344
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
So everyone must master a trick when drawing pictures.

345
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,460
You have to draw a picture in a simple way.

346
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
This is the best way for everyone to understand.

347
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
If you draw a 3D picture,

348
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
it often has no extra points.

349
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Even if it's a round cake picture,

350
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
we also want it to be a two-dimensional round cake picture.

351
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
We don't want it to be a three-dimensional round cake picture.

352
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,460
You can be a very beautiful two-dimensional picture.

353
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
That's better than a three-dimensional picture.

354
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Because the three-dimensional picture will be a bit oblique.

355
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,460
So it's hard to compare the size of each sector.

356
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Then this three-dimensional picture is even more exaggerated.

357
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
It's uglier.

358
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,460
This picture, as you can see, is very strange.

359
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
This picture has no data points at all.

360
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,460
And it's empty.

361
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,460
This picture is very, very empty.

362
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
Then there is no data point.

363
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,460
It looks like a picture with very little information.

364
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
This picture either needs to be removed.

365
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
Otherwise, you have to add more data.

366
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Or add more information.

367
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
This picture is too empty.

368
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
What about this picture?

369
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Let's see if you can see it.

370
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Where is the problem with this picture?

371
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,460
This is also a picture that I often see in my students' reports.

372
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
I can't see where the problem is.

373
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
But I don't know what this picture is talking about.

374
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,460
This picture is more professional.

375
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,460
The biggest problem with this picture is the error bar.

376
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,460
The error bar should be visible from top to bottom.

377
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Especially the black one.

378
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Can you see these two sides?

379
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,460
You can hardly see these four black errors.

380
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Then William said the unit.

381
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Yes, there is no unit.

382
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
They didn't tell you how high this is.

383
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
What does it mean to be high?

384
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
And what is the unit of this activity?

385
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
This is also a very good point.

386
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,460
So this error bar is a lot of experiments.

387
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Especially social science.

388
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
It's a lot of experiments.

389
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
There was originally an error bar.

390
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
You shouldn't go up.

391
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Because you want to talk about two things.

392
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
What does it have to do with?

393
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Or you have to compare two things.

394
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
One is high, one is low.

395
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
You have to call the error bar.

396
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
You can make an effective comparison.

397
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
So the error bar is what people do most often.

398
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
The point where the tree map is forgotten.

399
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Then the error bar must be very clear.

400
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Be sure to come out.

401
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
Don't use it like this.

402
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
You can't even see it in black.

403
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
This is a similar problem we just talked about.

404
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
It's a tasteless 3D.

405
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Look at this 3D.

406
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
There is no bonus.

407
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
There is no bonus at all.

408
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Below this is even worse.

409
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
So we've seen a few pictures now.

410
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
Everyone has an opinion.

411
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Everyone probably knows how ugly the scientific map is.

412
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,460
When you're drawing.

413
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
When you finish the picture.

414
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
You have to ask yourself.

415
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Is your picture so ugly?

416
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
And then if you think it's ugly.

417
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
You have to improve it a little bit.

418
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,460
How can it be more beautiful?

419
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Is there enough information?

420
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
OK.

421
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
There's another big problem.

422
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Some pictures.

423
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
After it's done.

424
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
It's just that when you zoom in, it's a little bit of a blur.

425
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,460
So this kind of blurred picture.

426
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
We'll try to avoid it.

427
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Because a lot of people now.

428
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Some people may want to look at the details.

429
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
I want to zoom in as much as I can.

430
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
If you blur it.

431
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
It's hard for people to look at the details.

432
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,460
So we want all the pictures.

433
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Try to use the amount of pictures.

434
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
But this is not absolute.

435
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
I can only say that 80 to 90 percent of the pictures.

436
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
It could be the amount of pictures.

437
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
But.

438
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
There are still a lot of pictures.

439
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
They can't make the amount of pictures.

440
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,460
For example, like this picture.

441
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
For example, you take your experiment.

442
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
Oh, that picture.

443
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
You can't make the amount of pictures.

444
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
You have to.

445
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,460
It is what it is.

446
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
You have to put it on like this.

447
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
So you put these pictures in.

448
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
It's okay, too.

449
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
You just have to make sure it's high enough.

450
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,460
It's more than 300 dpi.

451
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
OK.

452
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,460
That's the best thing about illustrator.

453
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
It can make all your ideas.

454
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
The amount of pictures.

455
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
So.

456
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Go to the data visualization.

457
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
It's just that he has some of these.

458
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
It's basically.

459
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
You have a data.

460
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
You have to think about this data first.

461
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
What story do you want to tell?

462
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,460
And then how do you get this data to attract people?

463
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
It's you.

464
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Um, I'm basically a little outlier.

465
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
But these are the ones we just talked about.

466
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,460
It's this data.

467
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
He must love it.

468
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
It looks beautiful and interesting.

469
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Or a very amazing fact.

470
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
Or a very innovative idea.

471
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
Or this data.

472
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
To be able to tell you what the experiment I did is.

473
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Show it to you very clearly.

474
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,460
OK.

475
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
Uh, or.

476
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Some people will put some innovative pictures.

477
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Or some.

478
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
Pictures that attract people's attention.

479
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
Right?

480
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,460
These pictures can reinforce some arguments or opinions.

481
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
For example, I'm going to talk about a point of view later.

482
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Uh, that point of view.

483
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
I might need a picture to support it.

484
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
This picture is not necessarily my data picture.

485
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
It's not necessarily my intention.

486
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
But I can draw a process picture.

487
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Or go and talk about my more.

488
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
More, uh, more profound.

489
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
A more powerful one.

490
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
A point of view.

491
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
OK.

492
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
So these are all things you might be able to put on the map.

493
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,460
It's just that you're going to put it on the map.

494
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
But this is a very good example.

495
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,460
It's just that NASA is making a beautiful picture.

496
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
It's still very good.

497
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Look at how beautiful this picture is.

498
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
I'm not in this field at all.

499
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,460
But when I look at this picture, I know what it's talking about.

500
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,460
He's talking about the carbon dioxide level before us.

501
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
It's been fluctuating all the time.

502
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,460
But it's about less than 100 years from us.

503
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
He just rushed up like this.

504
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
So what's the conclusion of this picture?

505
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
It's about the million years.

506
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,460
It's about the carbon dioxide of our atmosphere that's never been above this line.

507
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Boom.

508
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
This picture.

509
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Just how clear it is.

510
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
He has data.

511
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,460
And then.

512
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,460
It just tells you.

513
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,460
It's just that you don't need to read a single article after you've read it.

514
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
You know what it's about.

515
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
This is a great picture.

516
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
It's a picture that's perfect for the presentation.

517
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Or if your article is to be published in a magazine or in a school.

518
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,460
This is a picture of what you're going to put in those places.

519
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
And you just need to put this picture in.

520
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
Yeah, well, look at the background. It's beautiful, too.

521
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,460
It's the background of the earth and the outer space.

522
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
The background of the atmosphere.

523
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
It's just that it makes you think.

524
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,460
OK.

525
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,460
So, like this picture, it's a very good, very good picture.

526
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,460
This picture is also very good.

527
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
This is the year.

528
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
This is the year.

529
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,460
And then the center axis is the solar radiation on the left.

530
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,460
The temperature is on the right.

531
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,460
And then you look at it and it's got an average value.

532
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,460
The average value of 11 years.

533
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
It's got this one in the hospital.

534
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,460
It's very clear at a glance.

535
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
Right?

536
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,460
And then he's got, uh, he's got his, uh, uh, unit, like this.

537
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,460
And then this picture, uh, there's one more thing that's worth it.

538
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,460
What everyone likes is his, uh, the temperature is red.

539
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,460
And then this solar radiation is yellow.

540
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
It's the temperature. You'll feel hot.

541
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
So you'll instinctively use red.

542
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,460
And then the solar radiation is yellow because it's like the sun.

543
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
So I'm going to use yellow.

544
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,460
So, you know, when you're choosing colors, you're going to be able to choose colors.

545
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,460
The easier it is for the reader to think about it, the better it is.

546
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
And then you look at these two pictures.

547
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,460
These beautiful pictures are usually black background, right?

548
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
This kind of black background picture, you don't usually put it on paper.

549
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
But I like it very much.

550
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Because it's just easy to catch.

551
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
It's just catching.

552
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
It's your audience's attention.

553
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,460
It's just that when you see black and then there's a bright one, you're going to want to pay attention to it.

554
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,460
It's just that it's psychological.

555
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,460
It's just that everyone will be like this.

556
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
So you're going to see this amazing picture.

557
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
It's usually black background.

558
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
And then you're going to think it's cool.

559
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
So this is a very good example.

560
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
This is also a very good memory picture.

561
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Okay, so this picture looks like it's talking about global warming.

562
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,460
But it's just that this is a picture I picked up from the Internet.

563
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,460
So it's not that he's a little bit of a realist.

564
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
So we just talked about these things, right?

565
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
What I'm talking about above is more like a sense of beauty.

566
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
It's just that you have to keep writing articles.

567
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,460
And then when you're criticized or you criticize someone, you develop a sense of beauty.

568
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,460
So what do you actually do when you're writing a paper?

569
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Basically, you want to use as little ink as possible.

570
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,460
So that the reader can get the most ideas in the shortest time.

571
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,460
So you have to try to make your articles as short as possible.

572
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,460
So at the beginning, you might be the first one to do it.

573
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,460
It's a lot of pictures, a lot of words, a lot of tables.

574
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,460
But you have to shorten it as much as you can.

575
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
So you have to shorten it as much as you can.

576
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
So you have to shorten it as much as you can.

577
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
But you have to shorten it as much as you can.

578
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,460
It's just two or three articles.

579
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
It's just that you have to shorten it slowly.

580
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,460
And then every time you review it, you have to look at it.

581
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Can I use a picture as a substitute for this paragraph?

582
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Is this paragraph really necessary?

583
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Or can I move on to the next page?

584
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,460
So you have to keep reviewing this thing.

585
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:28,460
And then in the end, your very messy ideas will turn into a beautiful paper.

586
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
It just looks very clean.

587
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:37,460
And then every space, every space in your paper will be used in a huge way.

588
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
So what's the content?

589
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,460
What content do you use to present when you're writing an article?

590
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
You might start writing when you're writing an article.

591
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
There are some points.

592
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Oh, what's the instrument?

593
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
You'll make a big bar first.

594
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,460
When you're making your big bar, you'll find that this part.

595
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,460
I want to make it clear in words, but it's very difficult.

596
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
I don't know how to make it clear.

597
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,460
If your instrument is like the instrument or the experiment, it's usually hard to make it clear, right?

598
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
That kind of thing that's hard to make clear.

599
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,460
You can choose to use a picture as a substitute.

600
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,460
For example, the first picture is like this.

601
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Or the experiment's instrument picture is like this.

602
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
But if you have an instrument picture, your instrument is very simple.

603
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
It's just a layer of shit.

604
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Then you don't have to.

605
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
You just say, oh, I've got a layer of shit.

606
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,460
You don't have to draw a shit over there.

607
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
so

608
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,460
It's got to be important, but it's hard to make it clear in words, and then you get a picture.

609
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
So this is the picture.

610
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,460
The second one is an effective and supportive point of view.

611
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,460
You have to write your argument when you're writing an article, right?

612
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,460
Someone says, I'm measuring this, this, this, and I found something, something.

613
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,460
So when you say that, you need something to support your argument.

614
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,460
What supports your argument, supporting your argument, is your data and your experiment.

615
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,460
How do you get your data and your experiment to support your argument?

616
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,460
Basically, you have to tell people your data, but there's a lot of data, a lot of numbers flying around.

617
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,460
At this time, you can also take a picture of the experiment.

618
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,460
That picture can clearly support your argument.

619
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,460
When you first started making the picture, you might have a bunch of different pictures.

620
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
You have to pick which pictures will be in the article.

621
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
You just put it up.

622
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,460
If you don't talk about it in the article, you don't put it up.

623
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,460
Or you don't put it up at all.

624
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:33,460
And then the third one is the third picture, which is what Jason just mentioned.

625
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,460
This is an innovative picture, which is what you usually find difficult to make clear.

626
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
It has your data arguments.

627
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
This is the only two in the general paper.

628
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,460
But when you want to get a better start, or when you want to face a wider audience.

629
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,460
And then when your article is very important.

630
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,460
You need to have a picture that can quickly make people understand what you're best at.

631
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Where's your paper?

632
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Is it a quick read of your conclusion or your logic?

633
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Or is it your most innovative part?

634
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,460
This is an innovative picture.

635
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Like the two NASA pictures I just showed you.

636
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,460
It's the third one, the innovative picture.

637
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,460
It's the innovative picture, or the second one.

638
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,460
But it's a library.

639
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,460
It has a lot of things and a background.

640
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,460
So it's basically a mix of two and three.

641
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
Like this picture.

642
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Even if we're not in the same industry, we can see the conclusion right away.

643
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
This picture is amazing.

644
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,460
This kind of picture usually takes a long time to change.

645
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Each font, font, even the color and width have to be changed back and forth.

646
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
This kind of picture is usually very important.

647
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,460
If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat.

648
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm talking a little fast.

649
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,460
If you want me to speak slower, you can talk to me.

650
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,460
These three pictures are also pictures on this Nature.

651
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
The first one is data.

652
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
The second one is the process.

653
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,460
The third one is the most important conclusion.

654
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,460
For example, what is a neuron cell?

655
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Release to another neuron cell.

656
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
What are the receptors?

657
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
This is the conclusion picture.

658
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Look at this picture.

659
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,460
It's not your process, it's not your data.

660
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
It's just a story.

661
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,460
But this story, you can actually replace it with a couple of words.

662
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
In the text.

663
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
But he still chose to draw it.

664
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Because this idea is very important.

665
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,460
You want the audience to catch this idea.

666
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
So they draw this picture.

667
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
Then the whole piece of paper may only put this picture.

668
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Or put this picture on the first page.

669
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
This data picture, Illustrator can help.

670
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,460
The second and third are the strengths of Illustrator.

671
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Draw this beautiful picture.

672
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,460
This is the strength of Illustrator.

673
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
This is the drawing process.

674
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,460
We just talked about it a little bit.

675
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Basically, you have to prepare a picture.

676
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Prepare a good picture.

677
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,460
Ask yourself some questions.

678
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,460
I can put the slides up later.

679
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Because the content I prepared today is actually more than an hour.

680
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,460
So I want to talk about something.

681
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
I think you might be more interested.

682
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,460
But if you want to slow down in some places.

683
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,460
If you talk a little more, you can write it in the chat.

684
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Then we can go over.

685
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,460
Basically, you have to prepare a picture.

686
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,460
The idea of ​​a picture is the most important.

687
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,460
You make sure what to do with this picture.

688
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,460
Then you use the draft draft first.

689
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
After you are sure to use this picture,

690
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,460
The second thing you should do is to study the journal you want to submit.

691
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,460
The style of this journal.

692
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
For example, how big is his file?

693
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
How big is the font?

694
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
What font?

695
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
He might have some regulations.

696
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Then you use your data.

697
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Because you are using MATLAB, Mathematica, or some data processing programs.

698
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,460
Or Excel.

699
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,460
When you use them to export, try to follow the standard output.

700
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,460
The better you export here.

701
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
The easier it will be to beautify it in the end.

702
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
If you export it badly.

703
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,460
It may take one or two hours to beautify it.

704
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
To handle a picture.

705
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,460
So when you export, it's best to try to follow the standard output.

706
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Then the third is that you get it all done.

707
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
Then we start to draw.

708
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Then we start to beautify.

709
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:52,460
This is the point of beautification.

710
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,460
For example, how much font do you want to use?

711
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,460
What kind of picture do you want to use?

712
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,460
I probably made a list here.

713
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
How to choose the color?

714
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,460
I just made a list here.

715
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Does anyone want to go over?

716
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
Or we can start talking about Illustrator.

717
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,460
This table is what I prepared for everyone.

718
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
This table is what I prepared for everyone.

719
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
When you export this picture.

720
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Try to use the same amount of pictures.

721
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
There's nothing you can do.

722
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
If it's too big, just use JP.

723
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Just use a normal picture.

724
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Try to use the same amount of pictures.

725
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Do not mess with the picture.

726
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Do not mess with the picture.

727
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,460
Then the third is that I think the average person may have not noticed.

728
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
When do you use the line picture?

729
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,460
When do you use the column picture?

730
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
When do you use the column picture?

731
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,460
The line picture is used in.

732
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,460
When your X and Y are continuous.

733
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Then you have to show people a trend.

734
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
If you don't want to show people a trend.

735
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
You just want to compare some of the paper.

736
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
Don't use the line picture.

737
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Don't use a little bit of the line picture.

738
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Don't connect it.

739
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Don't use a little bit.

740
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,460
You have a line picture.

741
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
You must be able to tell people.

742
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
This thing grows up.

743
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Grow down or have a pit.

744
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
You must have a thought like this.

745
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Then you use the line picture.

746
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
You have to say.

747
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
There are so many people without infection.

748
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
There are so many people with infection.

749
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,460
You are a project, a project, a project.

750
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,460
This is the column picture.

751
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,460
Then the opposite is still.

752
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,460
If you want to tell people a trend.

753
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
You can say I measure this thing.

754
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Get one measure.

755
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,460
The second one gets two.

756
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
The third one gets three.

757
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I want to show a trend.

758
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,460
You may want to say I only measure three points.

759
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,460
Can I use the column picture?

760
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,460
The column picture will let people naturally.

761
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,460
These two things are related to X and Y.

762
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
But the column picture won't.

763
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,460
Then a picture is best to convey one to two concepts.

764
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,460
But you have to convey it very clearly.

765
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.

766
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.

767
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Four or five pictures or four or five concepts.

768
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
There are too many lines.

769
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
I don't know what I'm reading.

770
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Then the font size.

771
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,460
You can adjust it yourself.

772
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
You can adjust it yourself.

773
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,460
Don't use less than 7pt.

774
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Don't use less than 7pt.

775
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,460
You can't see the printout of the form.

776
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,460
You can't see the printout of the form.

777
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,460
Then I want to talk about the complete.

778
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Some ideas are posed with images.

779
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,460
Some ideas are posed with images.

780
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Don't burn this thing.

781
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,960
Don't burn this thing.

782
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
It is necessary to have a data.

783
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
But it's not important enough.

784
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
But it's not important enough.

785
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
But it's not important enough.

786
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.

787
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.

788
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
If you really want to show a folder,you can put this into the directory.

789
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,960
But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.

790
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
If you really want to show this big database with a folder.

791
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.

792
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Even if you have been programming better for a few years,

793
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,960
people want to give others aさらを

794
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Try to detoxify.

795
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Humans don't use light yellow or yellow.

796
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Don't use light yellow or yellow.

797
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
The simpler the color, the better.

798
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
The simpler the color, the better.

799
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Red, blue, green are simple colors.

800
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
If there is only one color to choose, choose blue.

801
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
After you finish this color,

802
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
After you finish this color,

803
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
It's best to print it out with a black and white printer.

804
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
After printing it out, you may find that

805
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Oh, I might have three lines.

806
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Oh, I might have three lines.

807
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Then I use different colors.

808
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Then I use different colors.

809
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
This is not good.

810
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
You'd better choose three colors.

811
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Then print it out.

812
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Then print it out.

813
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.

814
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.

815
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Or you can just use different colors for data points.

816
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Or you can just use different colors for data points.

817
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Because some people are red and green blind.

818
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
So they can't tell the color.

819
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
So if you don't know the color before you die,

820
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
You have to use different shapes for data points.

821
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
So you see a lot of experimental schools

822
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.

823
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.

824
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
So if you basically make my outline,

825
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
So if you basically make my outline,

826
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
The picture won't be too bad.

827
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
If you want to make it very beautiful,

828
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.

829
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.

830
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
It follows its style.

831
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
For example, how much size it is, how much you use.

832
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
For example, how much size it is, how much you use.

833
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
How thick the line is.

834
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.

835
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.

836
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
If you like it, you can just take it away.

837
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
I have a question here.

838
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Can I ask?

839
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
I have a question here.

840
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I see a lot of articles

841
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
And there will be insets in the picture.

842
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
And there will be insets in the picture.

843
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
There may be another example in one corner.

844
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
There may be another example in one corner.

845
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Is this picture good?

846
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Is this picture good?

847
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Is this picture good?

848
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Or what is the situation?

849
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
This is a very good question.

850
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Insets are very difficult to draw.

851
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Insets are very difficult to draw.

852
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

853
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

854
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.

855
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

856
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

857
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
So the more inset you have, the more space you have.

858
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
So let me draw something simple.

859
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
So let me draw something simple.

860
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Okay.

861
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I can't go forward so much...

862
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
What?

863
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I can't go forward so much...

864
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Did you see it?

865
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I didn't see what I was drawing.

866
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
No.

867
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
You didn't see it either.

868
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
I'll try again.

869
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I have a picture like this, right?

870
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
For example, I want to put a picture on this empty space.

871
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

872
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

873
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.

874
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
If my line looks like this,

875
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
if my line looks like this,

876
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
I have a blank space here.

877
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
I feel, you know,

878
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
I have something I want to explain.

879
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
That little thing may not be so important

880
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
I need to put a picture of myself.

881
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I just want to mention it a little bit.

882
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
I can put it right here.

883
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
You can use this picture.

884
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
But if your picture

885
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
It's not very good, it might look like this.

886
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
But you still have a small insert,

887
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
You think it could be added points.

888
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
What can you do?

889
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
You can make this picture into a semi-log.

890
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,960
You can make it a log.

891
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Then this will be squeezed over here.

892
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.

893
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.

894
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
But don't make it too exaggerated.

895
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,960
But don't make it too exaggerated.

896
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
It's a balance.

897
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
This is a good little trick.

898
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
This is a good little trick.

899
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,

900
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,

901
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
If this picture is important to you,

902
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.

903
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.

904
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

905
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

906
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
I'm not going to box these two pictures.

907
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
I'll delete these two photos.

908
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I don't need to box.

909
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

910
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

911
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.

912
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.

913
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.

914
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
But that's not a bad thing.

915
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
But that's not a bad thing.

916
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.

917
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,960
It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.

918
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

919
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

920
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.

921
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,960
My teacher read it first.

922
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,440
The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.

923
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.

924
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
You use 11 for the X and Y.

925
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,920
You use 11 for the X and Y.

926
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,920
The convention is 11 for the X and Y.

927
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
The convention is 11 for the X and Y.

928
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.

929
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.

930
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Your tick is a smaller two font.

931
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
Your tick is a smaller two font.

932
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
It will become 9.

933
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
It will become 9.

934
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
3 is 11, so it's 9.

935
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

936
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

937
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
You use 9 for the X and Y.

938
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

939
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

940
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
become 7?

941
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Because we follow them.

942
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,220
The smallest ones become 7.

943
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,220
The smallest ones become 7.

944
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,220
So it becomes very crowded

945
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,220
because you have to use the smallest font size.

946
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Sometimes you may want to explain

947
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
some things,

948
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
but you may find that

949
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
you can't fit in your words.

950
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
But don't be discouraged.

951
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,220
When you do Incept,

952
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,220
it's very crowded,

953
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,220
so you have to make some space.

954
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,220
But with Incept,

955
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,220
the numbers inside are already 7.

956
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,220
So you have to think about

957
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,220
how to make it

958
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,220
less crowded.

959
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
less crowded.

960
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,220
Sorry,

961
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I just thought of another question.

962
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
Am I asking too many questions?

963
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,220
No, no.

964
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,220
When I write articles,

965
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,220
I often encounter a problem.

966
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,220
For example,

967
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
the editor may tell me

968
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,220
that the order of

969
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,220
reference to figure

970
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,220
in the article is wrong.

971
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
For example,

972
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
I may write

973
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
and reference figure 1,

974
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
and then reference figure 2B,

975
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,220
and then reference figure 2A,

976
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,220
and so on.

977
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
But sometimes

978
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,220
it's just a problem with the layout.

979
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
I think this layout is better.

980
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,220
It's better to show it on the layout.

981
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,220
But when you're writing,

982
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,220
it's better to show it in another direction.

983
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,220
Do you have any suggestions?

984
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,220
Okay.

985
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,220
This problem

986
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,220
is caused by the layout.

987
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
When you encounter this problem,

988
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,220
you may be very reluctant

989
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,220
and may not know

990
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
how to change the layout.

991
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,220
Or how to move it

992
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,220
to make it better.

993
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,220
This problem

994
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,220
is caused by the layout.

995
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,220
Basically,

996
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
you have to go back

997
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,220
to the first change.

998
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,220
Most of the time,

999
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,220
you can't make it better.

1000
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
When you start writing,

1001
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
you have to try to avoid this problem.

1002
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
How do you avoid this problem?

1003
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
When you write your article,

1004
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,220
your logic should be one line.

1005
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,220
Sometimes,

1006
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,220
when we write articles,

1007
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,220
when we write A,

1008
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,220
we want to talk about B,

1009
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,220
and we want to talk about C.

1010
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,220
But if your article is one line,

1011
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,220
for example,

1012
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,220
I talk about A to B first,

1013
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,220
B to C,

1014
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,220
C to D.

1015
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Or when I do the experiment,

1016
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,220
I talk about a point first.

1017
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,220
I only talk about one material.

1018
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
Then I may talk about another material later.

1019
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,220
If you do this,

1020
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,220
you can put all the pictures of this material

1021
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,220
in a small box.

1022
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,220
Then you won't have this cross-reference problem.

1023
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,220
So your problem is

1024
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,220
the logic of writing.

1025
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,220
You need to change it at the beginning.

1026
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,220
If you need to change it at the beginning,

1027
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,220
you can avoid it later.

1028
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,220
Thank you for your good question.

1029
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
If you have any questions,

1030
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,220
you can ask.

1031
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,220
This is also informal.

1032
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,220
I hope to help you

1033
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,220
if you have any questions.

1034
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,220
Next, I will talk about Illustrator.

1035
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,220
How many people have used Illustrator?

1036
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,220
One.

1037
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,220
Two.

1038
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,220
Three.

1039
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,220
Four.

1040
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,220
Five.

1041
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,220
Six.

1042
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,220
Seven.

1043
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,220
Eight.

1044
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,220
Nine.

1045
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,220
Ten.

1046
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,220
Eleven.

1047
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,220
Twelve.

1048
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,220
Thirteen.

1049
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
Fourteen.

1050
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,220
Fifteen.

1051
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,220
Sixteen.

1052
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,220
Illustrator's philosophy

1053
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,220
is a little different

1054
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
from other software.

1055
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,220
If you download Illustrator,

1056
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,220
you will see the interface like this.

1057
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,220
The middle is your drawing board.

1058
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,220
On the right,

1059
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,220
there are tools you often use on the left.

1060
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,220
For example,

1061
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,220
you can add text,

1062
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,220
add a frame,

1063
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,220
and so on.

1064
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,220
On the top,

1065
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,220
after you choose a tool,

1066
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
for example,

1067
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,220
I choose the first arrow.

1068
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,220
After I choose the arrow,

1069
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,220
there will be some tool details on it.

1070
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,220
This detail will change

1071
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,220
according to the tool you choose.

1072
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,220
For example,

1073
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,220
when I choose the arrow,

1074
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,220
I will choose a frame.

1075
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,220
When I choose a frame,

1076
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,220
I will adjust the thickness of the frame,

1077
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,220
the color of the frame,

1078
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,220
the color of the frame,

1079
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,220
the sharpness of the frame,

1080
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,220
the roundness of the frame,

1081
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,220
the style of the frame,

1082
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,220
or the transparency of the frame.

1083
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,220
You can basically find it here.

1084
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,220
If you can't find it,

1085
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,220
it may have this function.

1086
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,220
But you have to go to the list

1087
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,220
and look for it carefully.

1088
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,220
On the right,

1089
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,220
there are some advanced tools.

1090
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,220
The tools on the right

1091
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,220
are the tools I often use.

1092
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,220
This one is personalized.

1093
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,220
Usually, when you get it,

1094
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,220
there may only be one or two.

1095
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,220
As you use it for a long time,

1096
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,220
you can drag the tools you often use

1097
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,220
to this side.

1098
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,220
For example,

1099
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,220
I often use this one for building.

1100
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,220
Or adjust the line.

1101
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,220
There are also some colors for drawing.

1102
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,220
I often put them here.

1103
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,220
This is an advanced tool list.

1104
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,220
Okay.

1105
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,220
There is a question here.

1106
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,220
Yan is asking

1107
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,220
in the chat room.

1108
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,220
Do you recommend any open source software

1109
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,220
corresponding to Illustrator?

1110
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,220
No.

1111
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,220
Because I always use

1112
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,220
school software.

1113
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,220
I always use school software.

1114
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,220
I always use school software.

1115
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,220
In the chat room,

1116
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,220
someone mentioned Inkscape.

1117
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,220
It seems to be an open source software.

1118
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,220
Someone mentioned

1119
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,220
that it seems to be

1120
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,220
the open source of Illustrator.

1121
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,220
Oh.

1122
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,220
What is it called?

1123
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,220
I can see it later.

1124
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Okay.

1125
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,220
When you open

1126
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,220
Illustrator,

1127
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,220
I think you should talk about its logic first.

1128
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,220
Then you will know.

1129
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,220
The logic of Illustrator's drawing

1130
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,220
is like this.

1131
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,220
If you have never used this software,

1132
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,220
you are drawing in

1133
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,220
Illustrator or

1134
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,220
Powerpoint.

1135
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,220
For example,

1136
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,220
I draw a star.

1137
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,220
It is a star.

1138
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,220
You can't do anything

1139
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,220
to this star.

1140
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,220
For example,

1141
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,220
I want this star to have one less corner.

1142
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,220
But I want this star to be a hexagon.

1143
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,220
I can't do this.

1144
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,220
And this star,

1145
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,220
I might want it not to be so fat.

1146
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,220
I might want it to be a little thinner.

1147
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,220
What about this picture?

1148
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,220
The star on the left

1149
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,220
doesn't give you any wiggle room.

1150
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,220
You can't do this.

1151
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,220
But in Illustrator,

1152
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,220
when it reads a star,

1153
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,220
it reads a star like this on the right.

1154
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,220
Have you ever seen this dot?

1155
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,220
The square of this entity.

1156
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,220
This dot is called an anchor.

1157
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,220
This is a dot.

1158
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,220
This protruding thing

1159
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,220
will have a dot.

1160
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,220
The dot is connected

1161
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,220
by a straight line.

1162
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,220
Illustrator reads this picture

1163
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,220
and it reads a lot of dots.

1164
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,220
These dots

1165
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,220
will be connected by a straight line.

1166
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,220
These dots will be connected by a straight line.

1167
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,220
These dots will be connected by a straight line.

1168
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,220
But you may not want these dots,

1169
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,220
but want a curved line.

1170
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,220
That's why you-

1171
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,220
hm.

1172
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,220
That's why you

1173
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,220
have these dots.

1174
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,220
This dot is basically

1175
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,220
that line doesn't want a straight line.

1176
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,220
I want it to curve.

1177
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,220
So when you draw a circle,

1178
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,220
for example, for a circle not a straight line

1179
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,220
but a curved line,

1180
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,220
you can pick up this dot

1181
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,220
and draw a curve.

1182
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,220
I'll show you later.

1183
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,220
At this time,

1184
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,220
there will be two handles.

1185
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,220
These handles

1186
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,220
will control the curve of the line.

1187
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,220
So you can think about

1188
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,220
how we usually draw.

1189
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,220
Basically, it's all this idea.

1190
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,220
You draw a dot,

1191
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,220
connect the dots with the lines,

1192
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,220
and then adjust the curve of the line.

1193
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,220
Okay.

1194
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,220
Okay.

1195
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,220
That's it.

1196
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,220
Today,

1197
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,220
we're running out of time.

1198
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,220
I was going to-

1199
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,220
There's a lot more, right?

1200
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,220
Otherwise,

1201
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,220
I-

1202
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,220
This is-

1203
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,220
I found this on the Internet.

1204
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,220
Basically,

1205
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,220
I'm going to draw a picture for you to see.

1206
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,220
And then-

1207
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,220
Okay.

1208
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,220
I'm going to draw a picture

1209
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,220
for you to see.

1210
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,220
And then,

1211
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,220
I can give you these tips

1212
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,220
in PDF format.

1213
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,220
You can understand it by looking at it directly.

1214
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,220
For example, how thick the line should be.

1215
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,220
You can look at it directly.

1216
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,220
And how to start learning.

1217
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Okay, no problem.

1218
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
I'll draw a picture for you to see first.

1219
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,220
This way, you'll have more ideas.

1220
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
Okay.

1221
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
This picture is-

1222
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,220
I found this picture on the Internet.

1223
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,220
I drew this picture.

1224
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,220
It took me about an hour

1225
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
to reproduce this picture.

1226
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,220
Okay, so look at this picture.

1227
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,220
If you zoom in, it's a little blurry.

1228
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,220
And then the next one,

1229
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,220
I used Illustrator to draw the picture.

1230
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,220
Look, it's very clear when you zoom in.

1231
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
Okay.

1232
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,220
So how do I draw these pictures?

1233
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,220
Okay, let me-

1234
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,220
Okay.

1235
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,220
Let me-

1236
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,220
Let me see how I can

1237
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,220
zoom in.

1238
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
Okay.

1239
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,220
Let me-

1240
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,220
This is what I drew yesterday.

1241
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,220
Okay.

1242
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,220
So, look at this picture.

1243
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,220
I drew it one by one

1244
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,220
the way I told you.

1245
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,220
So,

1246
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,220
in this picture,

1247
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,220
do you have any-

1248
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,220
For example,

1249
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,220
I want to draw this tube.

1250
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,220
Okay, I want to draw this tube.

1251
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,220
Two circles plus a bar.

1252
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,220
How do I draw this picture?

1253
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,220
Okay, let me think about this picture.

1254
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,220
This picture is basically two circles plus a bar.

1255
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,220
So I'm going to draw two circles first.

1256
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,220
First,

1257
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,220
I'll- Okay.

1258
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,220
This is my tool, right?

1259
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,220
I'm going to choose something.

1260
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,220
Okay, I'll choose this one.

1261
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,220
This is a square, right?

1262
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,220
Okay.

1263
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
So this square,

1264
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,220
I'm going to click on this square again.

1265
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,220
Or there's a little triangle below.

1266
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,220
I don't know if you can see it.

1267
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,220
Okay, just click on it.

1268
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,220
My computer is a little slow right now.

1269
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,220
Okay.

1270
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,220
And then this picture can-

1271
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,220
This little tool can tell you,

1272
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,220
okay, you want to draw a square,

1273
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,220
but I don't have any other squares to choose from.

1274
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,220
For example, I have a circle,

1275
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,220
and then I have this kind of smooth

1276
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,220
or a star, and so on.

1277
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,220
Okay, I'm going to choose a circle now.

1278
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,220
So I'm going to choose a circle now.

1279
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,220
Is this how I draw it?

1280
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,220
Okay, so it's hard for me to say

1281
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,220
that I can draw a real circle, right?

1282
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,220
I just want to draw a real circle.

1283
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,220
So how do you draw a real circle?

1284
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,220
You can press Shift.

1285
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,220
And then pull.

1286
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,220
This circle must be a real circle.

1287
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,220
There are some shortcut keys in Illustrator.

1288
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,220
These shortcut keys will suggest you to memorize

1289
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,220
this circle.

1290
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,220
Okay, so I have a circle now.

1291
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,220
So I'm going to-

1292
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,220
I want another circle below,

1293
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,220
so I'm going to draw another circle.

1294
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,220
So I drew a circle,

1295
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,220
and then I want to use a square

1296
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,220
to connect them together.

1297
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
Right? Okay.

1298
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Basically, I have this picture.

1299
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,220
But this picture looks ugly.

1300
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,220
I want these colors to be right.

1301
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,220
For example,

1302
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,220
I want this to be black.

1303
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,220
What if this is black?

1304
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,220
What I'm drawing now is this object.

1305
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,220
Okay, I'm going to choose this black.

1306
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,220
And then I can choose-

1307
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,220
You see,

1308
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,220
this thing,

1309
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,220
there are some things you can do.

1310
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,220
The first one is the color inside.

1311
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,220
I choose black inside.

1312
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Okay, and then there's no color outside.

1313
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,220
What about this object?

1314
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,220
I can also choose black inside.

1315
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,220
And then there's no color outside.

1316
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,220
What about this object?

1317
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,220
I can also choose black inside.

1318
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,220
There's no color outside.

1319
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,220
I can also have three boxes

1320
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,220
and do this thing together.

1321
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,220
Now I've drawn

1322
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,220
a tube like this.

1323
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,220
I want them to be a little bit symmetrical.

1324
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,220
Because I'm just drawing a circle

1325
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,220
and then I'm drawing a bar inside.

1326
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,220
It might not be very symmetrical.

1327
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,220
We might want it to look better.

1328
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,220
When you think about this thing,

1329
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,220
Illustrator does a very intuitive job.

1330
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,220
You just pick these three things up

1331
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,220
and look at what you can do

1332
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,220
with this object on top.

1333
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,220
You'll see Align on top.

1334
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,220
How do you align it?

1335
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,220
You want to have two objects

1336
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,220
aligned in the middle.

1337
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,220
You can align it like this.

1338
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,220
Now these three things are

1339
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,220
beautifully aligned together.

1340
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,220
I'm going to add text on top later,

1341
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,220
so I want these three things

1342
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,220
to be connected together.

1343
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,220
I want these three objects

1344
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,220
to be connected into one object.

1345
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,220
If I want to do this,

1346
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,220
I can come here and choose

1347
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,220
Reshape Builder.

1348
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,220
It reshapes your object.

1349
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,220
I'm going to click on this.

1350
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,220
I'm going to move the cursor

1351
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,220
to the first one and then move it down.

1352
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,220
Look, the first one and the second one

1353
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,220
are merged together.

1354
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,220
The third one is merged together.

1355
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,220
The fourth one is merged together.

1356
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,220
The fifth one is merged together.

1357
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,220
When I let go,

1358
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,220
this whole thing becomes an object.

1359
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,220
I'm not going to draw a circle

1360
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,220
and then the shape of the circle

1361
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,220
becomes exactly the same.

1362
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,220
I'm going to choose a color.

1363
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,220
I'm going to choose this color.

1364
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,220
This color is ugly.

1365
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,220
Now I can choose this object.

1366
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,220
Now I've created a shape.

1367
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,220
After you've created a shape,

1368
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,220
you want to fill it in.

1369
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,220
You want to fill it in.

1370
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,220
You want to fill it in.

1371
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,220
How do you fill it in?

1372
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,220
You can draw another one,

1373
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,220
but it's hard to make it

1374
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,220
exactly the same.

1375
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,220
So what we're going to do

1376
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,220
is copy this thing.

1377
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,220
If we can cut it off

1378
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,220
and paste it on,

1379
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,220
it'll be exactly the same.

1380
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,220
How do I cut this thing off?

1381
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,220
When I want to cut this thing off,

1382
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,220
I'm going to do some cutting

1383
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,220
on this whole object.

1384
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,220
Do you remember

1385
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,220
the Illustrator logic I just talked about?

1386
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,220
There are two little dots here.

1387
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,220
There are two little dots here.

1388
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,220
The first thing you need to learn

1389
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,220
when you learn Illustrator

1390
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,220
is to select an object

1391
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,220
and then you can do some settings

1392
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,220
on this object.

1393
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,220
The second thing you need to learn

1394
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,220
is to select the most basic element

1395
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,220
in this object.

1396
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,220
is to select the most basic element

1397
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,220
in this object.

1398
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,220
So when I click on this little dot,

1399
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,220
So when I click on this little dot,

1400
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,220
look at my object.

1401
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,220
I don't know if you can see it.

1402
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:18,220
It's a little small.

1403
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,220
It's a little small.

1404
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,220
There's a dot here.

1405
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,220
There's a dot here.

1406
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,220
If you can't see it,

1407
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,220
you can tell me in the chat.

1408
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,220
I've got a lot of dots.

1409
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,220
These dots are the dots.

1410
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,220
I don't need this dot anymore.

1411
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,220
I don't need this dot anymore.

1412
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,220
Because I only need the bottom.

1413
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,220
I can delete it.

1414
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,220
You see, my picture is gone.

1415
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,220
You see, my picture is gone.

1416
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,220
So I can edit it directly.

1417
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,220
So I can edit it directly.

1418
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,220
So I've got an element.

1419
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,220
I don't need the dots.

1420
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,220
I don't need the dots.

1421
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,220
There's a trouble with this little dot.

1422
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

1423
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

1424
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,220
If it's deleted, it's gone.

1425
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,220
What do I do now?

1426
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,220
What do I do now?

1427
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,220
I canamazit these dots.

1428
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,220
I canamazit these dots.

1429
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,220
The dots I need turn blue.

1430
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,220
The dots I need turn blue.

1431
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,220
This allows

1432
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,220
press down key.

1433
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,220
press down key.

1434
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,220
press down key.

1435
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,220
press down key.

1436
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,220
Look, it becomes shorter.

1437
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,220
Now I can Add a different color.

1438
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,220
Now I can Add a different color.

1439
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,220
Now I move it.

1440
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,220
When I move it...

1441
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,220
When I move it...

1442
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:59,220
Why is it not aligned?

1443
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,220
Now I can move it.

1444
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,220
Now I can move it.

1445
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,220
When I move it...

1446
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,220
When I was modifying it,

1447
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,220
I accidentally made it smaller.

1448
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,220
Now I can move it.

1449
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,220
Now I can move it.

1450
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,220
Now I can move it.

1451
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,220
Now I can move it.

1452
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,220
When I was modifying it,

1453
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:01,220
I accidentally made it smaller.

1454
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,220
When I move it...

1455
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,220
Now it looks like this.

1456
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,220
I can modify it a little bit more.

1457
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,220
I want to make sure these two things are aligned.

1458
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,220
Now I have a tube.

1459
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,220
Now I have a tube.

1460
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,220
It's not perfect at the bottom.

1461
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,220
You can modify it a few more times.

1462
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,220
You can make it bigger and modify it a few more times.

1463
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,220
Now I can copy this.

1464
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,220
Now I have a tube.

1465
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,220
Now I have a tube.

1466
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:55,220
If you need to,

1467
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,220
I can show you how to make it.

1468
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,220
I can show you how to make it.

1469
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,220
If you want to learn how to do this,

1470
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,220
you can use that.

1471
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:06,220
Now I'm going to draw a star.

1472
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,220
Now I'm going to draw a star.

1473
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,220
draw a star

1474
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,220
There are five legs on this star.

1475
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,220
I could just make it six legs.

1476
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,220
I could just press the up and down buttons to make it have more legs.

1477
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,220
Or I could press the down button to make it have less legs.

1478
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,220
Illustrator has a lot of shortcut keys.

1479
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:41,220
You basically have to practice to remember.

1480
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,220
For example, I'm using this leg now.

1481
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:47,220
And this is my new star, right?

1482
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,220
I think this star is too sharp.

1483
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,220
I don't want it to be so sharp.

1484
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,220
I want it to be round.

1485
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,220
How do I make it round?

1486
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,220
I can choose this.

1487
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:05,220
I'm going to use this to change the inner components of this star.

1488
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,220
We just talked about the dots.

1489
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:12,220
The dots tell you that there must be a dot on these dots.

1490
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,220
I'm going to change the curve of this line.

1491
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,220
I'm going to pull this circle.

1492
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:22,220
See if my star is getting fat and round.

1493
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,220
It's getting fatter and rounder.

1494
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,220
For example, you don't want this star to be symmetrical.

1495
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,220
You want this leg to stand out.

1496
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,220
You can also use this to choose.

1497
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,220
For example, I want these two dots to stand out.

1498
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,220
I'm going to choose these two dots and pull them out.

1499
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,220
I might want these two dots to be particularly sharp.

1500
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,220
So I'm going to change the curve, right?

1501
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,220
At this time, you can also use this to choose this dot.

1502
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,220
I'm going to zoom in on this dot.

1503
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,220
After you click on this dot, do you see this line up here?

1504
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,220
This line is called the handle.

1505
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,220
This handle is to control the curvature.

1506
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,220
See if this is particularly sharp now.

1507
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,220
Or you can make a big one like this.

1508
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,220
I'm going to zoom in now.

1509
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,220
So when you look at someone else's picture,

1510
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,220
and you draw a picture,

1511
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,220
you're thinking,

1512
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:33,220
which basic shape can I start to transform?

1513
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,220
Sir, we have a question here.

1514
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,220
This is a question about

1515
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:47,220
whether the picture will be set to the size of the picture you want first,

1516
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,220
or do you draw it first and then set it?

1517
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,220
Another audience member also said,

1518
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:02,220
I'm also curious about how to integrate real photos into pictures.

1519
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,220
OK.

1520
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,220
Integrate real photos into pictures,

1521
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,220
is it pulling a picture in?

1522
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,220
I think that's what it means.

1523
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,220
For example, if he has a picture of a lab device,

1524
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,220
how do you integrate it in?

1525
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,220
OK.

1526
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,220
I'll talk about the first one first.

1527
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,220
The first question is very, very good.

1528
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,220
I think this is a trick that only those who are doing this will know.

1529
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,220
I'll open one first.

1530
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,220
I'll open another one.

1531
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,220
This is a picture of my experiment.

1532
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:49,220
I got this picture from something like Excel.

1533
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,220
And then I dragged it over,

1534
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,220
and then I beautified it like this.

1535
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,220
OK.

1536
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,220
In the process of beautifying,

1537
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,220
you see,

1538
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,220
will I make the painting board the size I want?

1539
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,220
I won't.

1540
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:05,220
There are a lot of reasons why I don't do this.

1541
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,220
Because this painting board is white.

1542
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,220
When you're painting,

1543
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,220
if you need something to...

1544
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,220
For example, when I'm painting now,

1545
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,220
I might have done something first.

1546
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:17,220
For example, I made a star.

1547
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,220
I'm going to use it later.

1548
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:22,220
But if my painting board is very small now,

1549
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,220
then my star...

1550
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,220
For example, I can change it now.

1551
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,220
I can change the painting board directly.

1552
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,220
OK.

1553
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,220
For example, I can change the painting board.

1554
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,220
If my painting board is very, very small at first,

1555
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,220
If my painting board is very, very small at first,

1556
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,220
You see, when my painting board is very small,

1557
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,220
the problem is that my object will be squeezed onto the painting board.

1558
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,220
Then it will be a little hard for me to see clearly.

1559
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,220
Because the background is gray.

1560
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,220
Usually white is easier to paint.

1561
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,220
So what do I do?

1562
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:15,220
I usually use a very large painting board.

1563
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,220
And then?

1564
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,220
For example, I want to deal with this data now.

1565
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,220
Suppose I haven't finished this data.

1566
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,220
I still want to deal with this data.

1567
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,220
I want to add something.

1568
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,220
OK.

1569
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,220
I can put this...

1570
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,220
I can put this thing next to it first.

1571
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,220
And then I'll draw something first.

1572
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,220
I'll draw...

1573
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,220
I'll draw the last thing I need.

1574
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,220
Where is it?

1575
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,220
Here.

1576
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:48,220
Suppose I want to put this last picture on a two-column paper.

1577
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,220
So I'm going to put it on a...

1578
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,220
Wait a minute.

1579
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,220
Black. OK.

1580
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,220
This is...

1581
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:03,220
This is the last thing I'm going to put on the paper.

1582
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,220
I'm going to put a picture in this space.

1583
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:10,220
Usually, if the paper is a two-column...

1584
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:14,220
Wait a minute. I'm going to make it bigger.

1585
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,220
OK.

1586
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,220
I'm going to choose this square now.

1587
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,220
I'm just going to pull a square.

1588
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:29,220
And then I'm going to adjust the width and length of this square.

1589
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,220
That's the width and height of the square.

1590
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:36,220
I usually use 3.75 inches for a two-column paper.

1591
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,220
Let me see.

1592
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,220
I wrote it all down below.

1593
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,220
How do you draw it?

1594
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,220
3.75 inches.

1595
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,220
If it's a double column, it's 3.75 inches.

1596
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,220
If it's a single column, it's 89 milliliters.

1597
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,220
OK.

1598
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:55,220
I'm going to use 3.75 inches for this thing.

1599
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,220
That's it.

1600
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
OK.

1601
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,220
And then I'm going to draw a picture.

1602
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,220
I'm going to put this picture...

1603
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,220
I'm going to put my data picture in.

1604
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,220
And then I can adjust this data picture.

1605
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,220
OK.

1606
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,220
For example, I want it to be smaller.

1607
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,220
Because I want to put another picture next to it.

1608
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,220
I want it to be smaller.

1609
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,220
Like this.

1610
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,220
OK.

1611
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,220
Like this.

1612
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,220
Like this.

1613
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,220
OK.

1614
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,220
OK.

1615
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,220
Then I'll put a picture here.

1616
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,220
And then...

1617
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,220
And then I'll put another picture here.

1618
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,220
And then I'll put another picture here.

1619
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,220
You'll think it's a little crowded.

1620
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,220
And then you might have to make each picture smaller.

1621
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,220
Anyway...

1622
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,220
You just put this grid...

1623
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,220
I drew this grid as your final size.

1624
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:03,220
And then you put your data in first.

1625
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,220
And then you can start to adjust it inside.

1626
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,220
For example, you can change this word.

1627
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,220
I can add a text here.

1628
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,220
I can re-enter the text.

1629
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,220
And then I'm sure this text is 11PT.

1630
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,220
For example, number.

1631
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,220
I'm going to pull this over here.

1632
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,220
Like this.

1633
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,220
You know what I mean?

1634
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:25,220
All your drafts are placed outside this box.

1635
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,220
And then you put your final product in this box.

1636
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,220
And then you just do it in there.

1637
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,220
OK.

1638
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,220
So when I'm done with this picture.

1639
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:34,220
This picture is already very beautiful.

1640
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,220
OK.

1641
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,220
All done.

1642
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,220
I'm going to export this picture.

1643
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,220
At this time, you put the things outside.

1644
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,220
For example, there may be some squares outside.

1645
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,220
You delete all these things.

1646
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,220
OK.

1647
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,220
Delete all the objects outside.

1648
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,220
After deleting it, keep this box.

1649
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,220
This box can't be deleted.

1650
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,220
Keep this box.

1651
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,220
Keep this box.

1652
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,220
And then turn the outer frame of this box into a transparent one.

1653
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,220
Transparent.

1654
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,220
And then at this time, you export it again.

1655
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,220
OK.

1656
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,220
At this time, you can save as.

1657
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,220
For example, I'll save it as an EPS.

1658
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,220
Like this.

1659
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,220
Example.

1660
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,220
For example, test1.

1661
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,220
And then when you export it, you have to choose a blank background.

1662
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,220
Choose transparent.

1663
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,220
OK.

1664
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,220
And then I'll export it.

1665
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,220
At this time, the picture I exported will be exactly.

1666
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,220
Just right.

1667
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:30,220
This frame.

1668
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,220
This white frame.

1669
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,220
It's just right.

1670
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,220
It's the frame you want to put on the paper.

1671
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,220
This width is just right.

1672
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,220
3.75 inches.

1673
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,220
This is the bottom of this piece of white.

1674
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,220
When you put the whole picture on it.

1675
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,220
You won't.

1676
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,220
Because sometimes you use latex.

1677
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,220
Or when you put the picture in the text.

1678
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,220
You'll zoom in.

1679
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,220
Because you want it to look pretty.

1680
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,220
So when you zoom in.

1681
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,220
The font of that text.

1682
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,220
It's going to zoom in with you.

1683
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,220
The shape of the picture is going to zoom in with you.

1684
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,220
So maybe when you were drawing the picture.

1685
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,220
What are these fonts?

1686
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,220
11pt.

1687
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,220
It looks very good.

1688
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,220
But because you zoom in.

1689
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,220
Maybe put it in the article.

1690
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,220
Hey, this 11 font.

1691
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,220
Zoom in.

1692
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,220
Maybe it becomes 7.

1693
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,220
Then you can't see it.

1694
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,220
It's almost invisible.

1695
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,220
Hey.

1696
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,220
So when you use Illustrator.

1697
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:28,220
I usually divide my page into two sides.

1698
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,220
OK.

1699
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,220
And then the first thing I do.

1700
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,220
Is to put my last.

1701
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,220
The size of this picture to be output.

1702
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,220
Draw it out with a frame.

1703
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,220
And then the width of this frame can't change.

1704
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,220
But the length can change.

1705
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,220
For example, I want to add two more pictures.

1706
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,220
It might get longer.

1707
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,220
Yeah.

1708
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,220
And then I use the right side as my drawing board.

1709
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,220
And then what am I going to draw?

1710
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,220
What words do I write?

1711
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,220
I'll take care of the right side.

1712
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,220
And then I'll stick it up here.

1713
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,220
And then slowly align.

1714
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,220
Yeah.

1715
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,220
And then after the alignment.

1716
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,220
You just have to make sure there's nothing out there.

1717
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,220
And then this frame at the end.

1718
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,220
If you make it transparent.

1719
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,220
Your output will be the whole one.

1720
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,220
It's just like this.

1721
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,220
You won't be.

1722
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,220
There's more white on the side.

1723
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,220
Or the size doesn't fit.

1724
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,220
What you want is exactly.

1725
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,220
What you draw is exactly what you want.

1726
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:20,220
Does that answer your question?

1727
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,220
Yes.

1728
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:27,220
I was answered.

1729
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,220
But I don't know if the actor was answered.

1730
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,220
OK.

1731
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:36,220
So you didn't know how to use the animation board at first.

1732
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,220
The animation board is usually for people who do art.

1733
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,220
They need to be.

1734
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,220
When they're printing, there's a problem with the edge.

1735
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:47,220
So they're usually the ones who understand the animation board.

1736
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,220
But I think this is better.

1737
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,220
And what's the harm in moving the board?

1738
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:56,220
You know, like, let's say I'm going to put my board.

1739
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,220
Make it the size I want.

1740
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,220
This is a big disadvantage.

1741
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,220
For example, I guess I will.

1742
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,220
Well, I was going to say, okay, I'm just.

1743
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,220
Yeah, you know, all right.

1744
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,220
My eyes are good.

1745
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,220
I can see black and white.

1746
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,220
I'm going to use this direct.

1747
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,220
Is there any problem with the board?

1748
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,220
Suppose I just made a drawing on the board.

1749
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,220
I've done it.

1750
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,220
And I don't have this frame.

1751
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,220
I just drew, drew, drew, drew, drew, drew it out.

1752
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,220
Ok, I'm done.

1753
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,220
I just want to say, all right.

1754
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:25,220
This is a.

1755
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,220
This is the animation board that I want to output.

1756
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,220
At this time, I'm.

1757
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,220
At this time, I'm going to save.

1758
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,220
And you can see where the difference is.

1759
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:50,220
Okay, have you seen the difference between this test and this test?

1760
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,220
Look at this test.

1761
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,220
Is this the case where the grid is wider?

1762
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:59,220
Is the grid of this test 2 getting narrower?

1763
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,220
And then you see if this grid is getting narrower.

1764
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,220
This distance is also a little wider.

1765
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,220
So why is that?

1766
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,220
Why isn't it?

1767
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,220
Look at how wide my panel is here.

1768
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,220
Look at how wide my panel is here.

1769
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,220
How does it look different from my final output?

1770
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,220
Why is this so wide? Why is this so narrow?

1771
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,220
On the contrary, if I used this grid at the beginning,

1772
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,220
You see, this is so wide, this is so wide.

1773
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,220
Right?

1774
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,220
So why is this?

1775
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,220
This is because when we're saving,

1776
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,220
Because this is an image.

1777
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,220
So your program will use

1778
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,220
Illustrator will use the simplest way to save your image.

1779
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,220
That is to say, you see,

1780
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:54,220
If I frame all these tools,

1781
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:57,220
You see, my tool actually only takes up so much of the panel.

1782
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,220
I didn't use the whole panel.

1783
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:01,220
So your computer will be very smart.

1784
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,220
It will choose this smallest frame.

1785
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,220
The space you actually use.

1786
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,220
And then you make it into a square and you output it directly.

1787
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,220
And if you don't use this place, it won't output.

1788
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,220
So what you're actually outputting is

1789
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,220
It's a little bit wider than you want it to be.

1790
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,220
There's a little bit of a gap.

1791
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:22,220
So that's why I'm going to put a frame here.

1792
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,220
To make sure that when you output it,

1793
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,220
It's the whole frame that I want.

1794
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,220
Got it.

1795
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:34,220
Okay, Yan said she got it.

1796
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,220
Okay, good, good.

1797
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,220
What's the second question?

1798
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,220
I think the audience has a lot of questions right now.

1799
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:45,220
Otherwise, we'll just answer the audience's questions directly.

1800
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:48,220
We'll take the rest of the time to answer the audience's questions, okay?

1801
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,220
Okay, okay.

1802
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:57,220
The second question is how to integrate the actual photo into the picture.

1803
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,220
Okay.

1804
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,220
And then this question is also a very good question.

1805
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,220
This is very tricky.

1806
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:08,220
I'm just sharing a screen.

1807
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:14,220
I'm assuming I don't want these things now.

1808
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:17,220
And then I'm going to put a picture in there.

1809
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,220
For example, I have a picture here.

1810
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,220
Okay, okay.

1811
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:41,220
And then you see, I just took this picture from my desktop.

1812
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,220
It's big now, isn't it?

1813
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:45,220
So I'm going to shrink it a little bit now.

1814
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,220
I'm using the shortcut to shrink it now.

1815
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,220
But if you have a magnifier here, you can also use this magnifier to shrink it.

1816
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,220
Okay, I'm going to shrink it now, and then I'm going to use the first one.

1817
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,220
The first one.

1818
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,220
This is a picture.

1819
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:02,220
It can no longer be broken into components.

1820
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,220
So when you choose, you always make the first choice.

1821
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,220
If you choose the second one, this picture will be easily destroyed by you.

1822
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:10,220
Okay, I've chosen this one now.

1823
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,220
Okay, so I'm going to shrink it now, and I'm going to put it on my drawing board.

1824
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,220
And then I'm going to zoom in and see what it looks like.

1825
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:36,220
If I want to put this picture up, I can just put it up.

1826
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,220
And then what's the advantage of Illustrator?

1827
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:50,220
I'm on the left side of the picture, and I'm on the right side of the picture, right?

1828
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,220
That's okay.

1829
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:56,220
It's just a picture that's going to be a thing.

1830
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:59,220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

1831
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,220
I'll save it.

1832
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,220
So when you export it, both of them will export.

1833
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

1834
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,220
So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.

1835
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:17,220
So you say, okay, this is an EPS, it's supposed to be a image.

1836
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,220
So I'm not going to be a real one when I zoom in.

1837
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,220
Okay, so the problem is, the left one is all really a real one.

1838
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,220
It's not going to be real.

1839
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,220
But the right one is.

1840
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,220
I've been zooming in and out.

1841
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:32,220
You see, this MF is starting to be real.

1842
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,220
So you want to put a picture in and drag it in.

1843
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,220
It's very simple.

1844
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,220
But it's a little tricky.

1845
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,220
You have to take this big picture.

1846
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,220
Because when you take this picture, it's a big file.

1847
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,220
It's a big size.

1848
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:49,220
So I recommend all the pictures.

1849
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,220
Even if he's not with anyone else.

1850
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,220
If you want to put it on your own.

1851
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,220
This picture is best handled by AI.

1852
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,220
You just drag it in like this.

1853
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:58,220
There's only one picture in the whole panel.

1854
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,220
It's better to come in.

1855
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:04,220
Because when you come in, you can take it from the original size.

1856
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,220
Maybe 1.3 megabytes.

1857
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,220
You just zoom in and out.

1858
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,220
Now we have this panel.

1859
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,220
It's the size we're going to export.

1860
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:17,220
For example, you want this picture to be this big.

1861
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,220
You can just look at it in this export size.

1862
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,220
Is it still readable?

1863
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:27,220
If I shrink it to this size, it's already blurred.

1864
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,220
That's just asking you to remake a picture.

1865
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:33,220
You need a high-resolution picture.

1866
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:36,220
If you look at this picture, it's good.

1867
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,220
This picture is after I took it down.

1868
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:42,220
It's still very clear.

1869
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,220
You see, I put it in a big way.

1870
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,220
Normally, a paper wouldn't be that big.

1871
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,220
Basically, it's still very clear.

1872
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,220
This picture is OK.

1873
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,220
This kind of photo doesn't usually require much.

1874
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,220
As long as you can see it when you zoom in.

1875
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:56,220
And the main feature is that you can see it.

1876
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,220
That's OK.

1877
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,220
So when you shrink this picture, make sure it's visible.

1878
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,220
It's the first thing you have to do.

1879
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,220
The second thing you have to do is export it.

1880
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:09,220
Like I just exported it to TAS 2, right?

1881
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,220
I can come over now and see how big this TAS 2 is.

1882
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,220
It's 3.4 MB.

1883
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:19,220
Compared to this one, my first one is a full-size picture.

1884
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,220
It's only 1.1 MB.

1885
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,220
As a result, after I added a picture, it became 3.4 MB.

1886
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,220
So when you're taking pictures,

1887
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:30,220
Sometimes you use a very fancy camera.

1888
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,220
The picture you take is 4K.

1889
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,220
The file is super big.

1890
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:38,220
After you export it, it's 1 GB or 500 MB.

1891
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,220
That's not going to work.

1892
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,220
Because often, for example, if you add four pictures together,

1893
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:44,220
It can only be, for example, 25 MB.

1894
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,220
Then you put a high-resolution picture on it first.

1895
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:50,220
Basically, it takes up all your space.

1896
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,220
That's not going to work.

1897
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,220
What do you do at this time?

1898
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,220
You have to go back and take this picture of yours.

1899
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,220
Use other software to lower its quality.

1900
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,220
It's not that good resolution.

1901
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,220
But it's visible.

1902
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,220
So when you put the picture in,

1903
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,220
You have to make sure the resolution is high enough.

1904
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,220
It's high enough to be visible.

1905
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,220
But you have to make sure it's not too high.

1906
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,220
Because it takes up a lot of resources.

1907
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:22,220
So this is the main problem.

1908
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:28,220
And then some people might want to, for example,

1909
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:34,220
For example, like this one, I just want to make a beautiful one.

1910
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,220
I'm going to give you a talk.

1911
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,220
I'm going to give you a beautiful picture like this.

1912
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:39,220
I want this picture to be the background of my data.

1913
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,220
Suppose I want it to be the background of my data.

1914
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,220
I can do the same thing.

1915
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,220
I'm going to pull it to the size I want.

1916
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:51,220
And then I want it to be at the bottom, right?

1917
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:58,220
So I'm going to put this thing at the bottom.

1918
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,220
So my data will show up on top.

1919
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:05,220
And then I can usually, if you do this kind of thing,

1920
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,220
You're going to need opacity.

1921
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,220
I just want it to be a little transparent.

1922
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,220
Like this.

1923
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,220
That's it.

1924
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,220
It looks like this data is related to AI.

1925
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,220
Something like that.

1926
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,220
That's fine, too.

1927
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,220
But it's the same thing.

1928
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:22,220
Every time you want to put in a picture,

1929
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,220
You have to pay attention to the resolution of this picture.

1930
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,220
It doesn't have a set rule that says how much it has to be.

1931
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:30,220
The guideline is that you can see it when you zoom in.

1932
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,220
That's it.

1933
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,220
I had a real problem before.

1934
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,220
How do you cut it?

1935
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,220
Do you want this?

1936
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
Yeah.

1937
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Oh, you don't want it.

1938
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,220
You're going to step on it, right?

1939
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,220
Yeah.

1940
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:48,220
Okay, let's get the opacity back first.

1941
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,220
Pull it back.

1942
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Okay.

1943
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,220
You just click on this.

1944
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,220
You just click on what you want to do.

1945
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:59,220
Basically, this bar up here.

1946
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,220
It has almost everything you want.

1947
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,220
If it's beyond your imagination,

1948
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,220
If it's not on top of it,

1949
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,220
You'll just have it on YouTube.

1950
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,220
It's going to be at the top.

1951
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,220
In this detail.

1952
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,220
Yeah.

1953
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,220
Do you want to crop?

1954
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,220
Basically.

1955
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,220
Then you press crop.

1956
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,220
Then you just cut it.

1957
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,220
Apply.

1958
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,220
Okay, that's it.

1959
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:39,220
Because it's an object now.

1960
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:43,220
If you want to put a star on it.

1961
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,220
I want to dig a star.

1962
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,220
I can do this.

1963
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,220
Dig like this.

1964
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,220
Got it.

1965
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,220
Let's go to the next question.

1966
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,220
Okay.

1967
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,220
The next question is,

1968
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:06,220
Can Illustrator add dots or lines to the pattern?

1969
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,220
Yeah, that's a question.

1970
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,220
And then I just saw another one.

1971
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,220
A similar question.

1972
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,220
Let's talk about it together.

1973
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,220
Okay.

1974
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,220
The other question is,

1975
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,220
In the example of the chemical measuring bottle,

1976
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:27,220
Is there a concept of scissors in Illustrator?

1977
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:29,220
So you don't have to delete the dots one by one.

1978
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,220
Just cut out the parts we don't want.

1979
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,220
Oh, okay.

1980
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,220
Yeah.

1981
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:37,220
Basically, it's delete.

1982
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,220
Or backspace.

1983
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,220
That's the one on your shoulder.

1984
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,220
For example, we're back here now, right?

1985
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:48,220
So what else can I do with this?

1986
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,220
I just shortened that dot.

1987
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,220
I'm going to use a way to add dots.

1988
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,220
To make this picture.

1989
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,220
This thing.

1990
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,220
I just didn't say that.

1991
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,220
If I just press this now.

1992
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:05,220
I'm going to edit the dots now.

1993
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:08,220
So I'm going to change the oil to direct selection.

1994
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:10,220
Then I can start to change the component.

1995
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,220
I'll click on this object first.

1996
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:14,220
One, two, three, four, five.

1997
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:16,220
I see that there are so many dots now.

1998
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,220
I don't want these three on top of me.

1999
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,220
I'll take it off first.

2000
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:22,220
I'll press delete.

2001
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,220
I'm going to press the keyboard to delete or backspace.

2002
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,220
You can do this.

2003
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,220
Or?

2004
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,220
Sometimes your dots are very dense.

2005
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,220
You might not be able to do that.

2006
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,220
It's so good, it's framed to your liking.

2007
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,220
At this time, you can.

2008
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,220
Uh, for example, you have to choose.

2009
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,220
You might be, uh.

2010
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:42,220
Okay, you press this.

2011
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,220
Then you choose this.

2012
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,220
I'm going to choose a dot now, right?

2013
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,220
I'm going to press shift.

2014
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,220
Just don't put shift.

2015
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:49,220
I can start to choose more dots.

2016
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,220
But because this is an image.

2017
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,220
It's not, uh.

2018
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,220
It's not like a little painter or a photo.

2019
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:58,220
Uh, that, that.

2020
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,220
What's that? Photoshop.

2021
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,220
Yeah, he didn't cut it.

2022
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,220
It's like cutting it off from the middle.

2023
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,220
He didn't.

2024
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,220
But he can do that.

2025
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:09,220
It's just that he has to go in.

2026
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:14,220
Delete every dot and line of the image.

2027
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:16,220
Or you can, you can delete it together.

2028
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,220
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a dot.

2029
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,220
How do I add it?

2030
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,220
Because I'm now the problem is the dot.

2031
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,220
So I'm going to move the dot now.

2032
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,220
You can see the left side of the toolbar.

2033
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:28,220
There's one of these things in there.

2034
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,220
Okay.

2035
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,220
Usually you see this.

2036
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,220
This is the pen tool.

2037
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,220
The pen tool, you press the right button.

2038
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:39,220
Or you, you just press this triangle.

2039
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:41,220
He's going to have four options.

2040
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,220
The first one is to draw a dot.

2041
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:46,220
I don't draw a line.

2042
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:47,220
I don't draw a picture.

2043
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,220
I just draw a dot.

2044
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,220
For example, like this.

2045
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:55,220
Okay, I'll just draw a dot.

2046
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:59,220
The second one is to add a dot.

2047
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,220
The third one is to subtract a dot.

2048
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,220
The fourth one is to pull the handle.

2049
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,220
That's what I'm doing now, right?

2050
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,220
But I want him to have a handle.

2051
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,220
I can use the fourth one to pull the handle.

2052
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:11,220
That's how you add a dot.

2053
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:14,220
I'm going to add a dot here.

2054
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,220
I'm going to add a dot here.

2055
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:20,220
Okay, that's it.

2056
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,220
So what am I doing now?

2057
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,220
I'm going to use this shape to click on this.

2058
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,220
Look at this.

2059
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,220
I'm going to use this direct selection to see.

2060
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:30,220
I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2061
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,220
There are two more dots here, right?

2062
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,220
I'm going to be happy now.

2063
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:35,220
Pick it up and delete it.

2064
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:40,220
That's it.

2065
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:44,220
And then I can just put this over here.

2066
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,220
I might want to cover this up.

2067
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,220
I might want to cover this up.

2068
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:49,220
Otherwise, it's a little weird.

2069
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:54,220
I'm going to use this pen tool to cover this up.

2070
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,220
I'm going to cover this up.

2071
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,220
And then I'm going to put this over here.

2072
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:59,220
Sometimes when you delete a dot, the shape will be a little bit of a walk.

2073
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
This is the color scheme.

2074
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,220
You might want to pay a little attention to it.

2075
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:09,220
I used some of the tricks yesterday.

2076
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:14,220
I used some of the tricks yesterday.

2077
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,220
It's just that it's exactly the same.

2078
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:20,220
If anyone wants to know later, we can share it.

2079
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:23,220
But this is how you increase the number of dots.

2080
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,220
You can also cut the dots.

2081
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,220
You can also cut the dots.

2082
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,220
You can also cut the dots.

2083
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,220
You can also cut the dots.

2084
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,220
You can also cut the dots.

2085
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:30,220
And then I cut the dots.

2086
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,220
I can also use this thing to pull the handle.

2087
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,220
I don't like this dot.

2088
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,220
I can press this.

2089
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:43,220
I can press this.

2090
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:48,220
I'm going to use this little thing.

2091
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:52,220
I'm going to use this little thing.

2092
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:58,220
And then I'm going to pull this handle.

2093
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:04,220
And then I'm going to pull this handle.

2094
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:05,220
Okay, look.

2095
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:12,220
It's a little heart.

2096
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,220
Okay.

2097
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,220
And then the other question is,

2098
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:27,220
Did you also adjust the dots for the Neuroscientist picture in the first video?

2099
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:40,220
Which one is the Neuroscientist picture?

2100
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:45,220
Are you talking about this one?

2101
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,220
Yes, it should be.

2102
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,220
It should be this one, right?

2103
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:51,220
Okay.

2104
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,220
This is a very good question.

2105
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:57,220
This picture is actually a little complicated, right?

2106
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,220
He can use that dot.

2107
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,220
If I made this picture,

2108
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:04,220
I might pull a star first.

2109
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:08,220
And then let that star become, for example, an octagonal star.

2110
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:13,220
And then I make each star round.

2111
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:17,220
But because you know this line, you don't have to do it yourself.

2112
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:20,220
I know it's going to take a lot of time to simulate this picture.

2113
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:23,220
Because I want to make sure that the curvature is exactly the same.

2114
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,220
But when you draw it yourself,

2115
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:30,220
For example, I can draw a simple Neuroscientist for you now.

2116
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:32,220
I'm like this.

2117
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,220
Okay.

2118
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:37,220
And then I want this one to be, for example, it's curved.

2119
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,220
Right?

2120
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:43,220
Then I can make it curved.

2121
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,220
This one is curved.

2122
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:47,220
This one is curved like this.

2123
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,220
I drew it a little ugly.

2124
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,220
I can make it curved.

2125
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:57,220
And then here.

2126
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:00,220
And then I might want it to be crooked.

2127
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,220
Then I'll add two more dots.

2128
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:07,220
For example, add a few more dots.

2129
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,220
And then I'll pull this dot out.

2130
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,220
And then the dots are also curved.

2131
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,220
This one is also curved.

2132
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,220
Wait a minute. I'm going to break this one.

2133
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,220
This is also curved.

2134
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,220
And then this one here is also curved.

2135
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,220
Okay.

2136
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,220
Basically, you're just doing this kind of thing.

2137
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,220
You're just adjusting it slowly.

2138
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:43,220
And then it's going to get better and better.

2139
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:45,220
Okay.

2140
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,220
It's easy to draw it up and then slowly draw it.

2141
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,220
You just want to draw it all the time.

2142
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:55,220
But anyway, this is it.

2143
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,220
This is it.

2144
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:59,220
You just add your own dots like this.

2145
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:02,220
So what do we usually do?

2146
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,220
There are two ways to do it.

2147
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:07,220
One is that you draw on the paper first.

2148
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:09,220
Draw a draft. It doesn't matter if it's ugly.

2149
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,220
Put the paper down and stick it on.

2150
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:13,220
And then when you're pulling the dots,

2151
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:15,220
you stick it to the line you drew.

2152
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:16,220
Pull it.

2153
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,220
That way, it's going to be smooth.

2154
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,220
It's not going to be that ugly.

2155
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:22,220
The other way is if you have

2156
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,220
an Adobe software.

2157
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,220
There's another software in Adobe.

2158
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:28,220
It's called Adobe Capture.

2159
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:30,220
It's basically...

2160
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:34,220
I think Google has this feature, too.

2161
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,220
You type in NeuronCell.

2162
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:39,220
And then it's going to have a vector neuron cell that someone else drew.

2163
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,220
You can just pull in someone else's neuron cell.

2164
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:43,220
And then modify it.

2165
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,220
For example, you just need a few more touches.

2166
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,220
And then you can do this, too.

2167
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:51,220
For example, I don't know if this one has it.

2168
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,220
You can see that I'm doing AI right now.

2169
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,220
There's a neuron cell in the upper right corner, right?

2170
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:02,220
You can search for someone else's neuron cell.

2171
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,220
Look, I have so many neuron cells.

2172
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:08,220
You might want to draw this one.

2173
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,220
You might want to draw a simple two-dimensional picture.

2174
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,220
Let's say you want to draw this one.

2175
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,220
This is generally...

2176
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,220
If you buy Adobe Stock, you can use it directly.

2177
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:20,220
If you don't buy it,

2178
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,220
you can screenshot it.

2179
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,220
You can take a picture of it.

2180
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:26,220
And then paste it in.

2181
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,220
For example, like this.

2182
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,220
I can screenshot it.

2183
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:32,220
I'll take a picture, paste it in.

2184
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:34,220
And then copy it and draw a similar one.

2185
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:36,220
I have a lot of...

2186
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,220
Here.

2187
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,220
Here.

2188
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:52,220
I can paste this picture in.

2189
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:54,220
And then put it at the end.

2190
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,220
And then I can start.

2191
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:02,220
Just follow this picture.

2192
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,220
I can...

2193
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:06,220
Make this colorless.

2194
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,220
And then start.

2195
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,220
Just start copying it.

2196
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:12,220
Okay.

2197
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:14,220
Or I can even

2198
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,220
add dots directly.

2199
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:26,220
Okay.

2200
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:28,220
Why is this panel so short?

2201
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:40,220
Okay.

2202
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,220
Okay.

2203
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,220
Or I can

2204
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:50,220
add dots directly.

2205
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,220
For example,

2206
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,220
I zoom in now, right?

2207
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,220
And then I want...

2208
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,220
You can see that I may need a dot here.

2209
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:00,220
I may need a dot here.

2210
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,220
I may need a dot here.

2211
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:04,220
I may need a dot here.

2212
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,220
I can draw a skeleton

2213
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:08,220
one by one.

2214
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:10,220
This may be easier than the stars.

2215
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:12,220
Okay.

2216
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,220
The more dots you have, the more you have to adjust.

2217
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:16,220
But of course it will look more real.

2218
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:22,220
Okay.

2219
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,220
Oh, I drew this badly.

2220
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:26,220
You probably know what I mean.

2221
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,220
You can learn it one by one.

2222
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:30,220
You can learn it one by one.

2223
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:32,220
Okay.

2224
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:34,220
This is a pretty good example.

2225
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,220
Okay.

2226
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:38,220
And then we have some more questions.

2227
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,220
And then we have some more questions.

2228
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,220
Is it...

2229
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,220
Is it...

2230
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,220
Is it...

2231
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:48,220
Is it...

2232
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:50,220
Is it...

2233
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,220
Is it...

2234
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,220
Is it...

2235
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,220
Is it...

2236
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,220
Is it...

2237
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,220
Is it...

2238
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,220
Is it...

2239
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:04,220
Is it...

2240
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,220
Is it...

2241
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,220
Is it...

2242
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,220
Is it...

2243
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:16,220
okay.

2244
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,220
Okay.

2245
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,220
Okay.

2246
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:22,220
I actually have a case today.

2247
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:24,220
I'm going to talk about this.

2248
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,220
So I can use this picture.

2249
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:28,220
I'll delete this picture first.

2250
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:30,220
I'll delete this picture first.

2251
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,220
Can you

2252
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,220
Can you

2253
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,220
Can you

2254
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:38,220
Can you

2255
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:40,220
Can you

2256
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:42,220
Can you

2257
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:44,220
Can you

2258
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:46,220
Can you

2259
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,220
Can you

2260
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,220
Can you

2261
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,220
Can you

2262
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:54,220
Can you

2263
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:56,220
Can you

2264
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:58,220
Can you

2265
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:00,220
Can you

2266
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:02,220
Can you

2267
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:04,220
Can you

2268
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,220
Can you

2269
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,220
Can you

2270
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,220
Can you

2271
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:12,220
Can you

2272
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,220
Can you

2273
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:16,220
Thank you

2274
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,260
Thank you

2275
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,220
Thank you

2276
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Thank you

2277
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,220
Thank you

2278
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,220
Thank you

2279
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,220
Thank you

2280
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,220
Thank you

2281
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:30,220
Thank you

2282
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,220
Thank you

2283
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,220
Thank you

2284
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,220
Thank you

2285
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:38,220
Thank you

2286
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:40,220
Thank you

2287
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:42,220
Thank you

2288
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,220
Thank you

2289
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:48,220
Let's make a final size box

2290
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,220
This box

2291
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:56,220
Let me adjust this box

2292
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,220
The size of this box is

2293
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,220
3.75 inches

2294
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:02,220
Assuming this is 3.75 inches

2295
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:08,220
This is my original picture

2296
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,220
I'm going to put this original picture in

2297
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,220
I'm going to put it in

2298
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,220
I'm going to put it in

2299
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,220
But you see I put it in

2300
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:20,220
Don't you think this line is particularly fat?

2301
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:24,220
And the word might be very small

2302
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,220
Not the font you want

2303
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:28,220
This is a little bit of trouble

2304
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,220
This is when I first told you

2305
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,220
When you are sure to use the picture

2306
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:34,220
The font you output directly to the software

2307
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,220
It's best to be the last font you use

2308
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,220
So you don't have to change it when you come in

2309
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,220
Because for example, you output

2310
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:42,220
For example, my picture

2311
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,220
I'm from my Excel

2312
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,220
After I output it from my Number

2313
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,220
I didn't specify

2314
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:50,220
my

2315
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,220
The size of these letters

2316
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,220
I didn't specify the size

2317
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:56,220
So he might use something like 28, 32

2318
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:58,220
Very big

2319
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:00,220
And then when I put it on, it becomes very big

2320
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:02,220
And when I shrink

2321
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,220
It's just that it's a little bit deformed

2322
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,220
It's a little weird

2323
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,220
So when you output

2324
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:10,220
For example, your tick

2325
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,220
All your numbers are 11

2326
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:14,220
Then

2327
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,220
Or 9

2328
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,220
This is the best

2329
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,220
So you don't have to change it here

2330
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,220
It's very troublesome

2331
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,220
What about the thickness of this line

2332
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,220
You'd better set it first

2333
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:28,220
If you can't set it, you can come here and change it

2334
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:30,220
I'll show you how to change it now

2335
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,220
When you put the data in here

2336
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,220
You don't want to make false data

2337
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,220
So every time you shrink

2338
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:40,220
There's a tool here

2339
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,220
Take this

2340
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,220
Free Transform

2341
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,220
Free Transform is

2342
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:50,220
After you pick up some objects

2343
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:52,220
You can use Free Transform

2344
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,220
To shrink

2345
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,220
You can shrink like this

2346
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,220
Or you can rotate

2347
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,220
When you use Free Transform

2348
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,220
You must press Shift

2349
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:04,220
So I'm going to write it down

2350
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,220
You have to press Shift when you shrink

2351
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:14,220
If you press Shift

2352
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,220
The proportion of your length and width will be fixed

2353
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:18,220
So you don't make false

2354
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,220
The whole data is suddenly deformed

2355
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,220
So you have to do this

2356
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,220
After I do this

2357
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,220
I'm going to come in and change the thickness of this data

2358
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:28,220
How to change

2359
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:30,220
At this time, I'm going to talk about

2360
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:32,220
How does the general software process the layout?

2361
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:34,220
You see, we're processing the layout in the AI

2362
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,220
All the things are dots

2363
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,220
The lines are connected, right?

2364
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,220
It's very simple

2365
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,220
It's like our kids are drawing

2366
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,220
But the general software is processing the layout

2367
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:46,220
It's not like this

2368
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:48,220
It's to make sure that every line or every layout

2369
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:50,220
After the output

2370
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,220
It's still the way it was

2371
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,220
So every layout

2372
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,220
Every line, every dot

2373
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,220
Even every number, every icon

2374
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,220
We're going to use a thing called clipping mask

2375
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:02,220
It's the protector

2376
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:08,220
What is clipping mask?

2377
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,220
You must be doing powerpoint

2378
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,220
There is

2379
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,220
Let me see

2380
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,220
You must be doing powerpoint

2381
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,220
There's something about it

2382
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,220
For example, I added a slide

2383
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,220
OK

2384
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,220
You see, I'm in this slide

2385
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,220
Is there a picture on the left?

2386
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:34,220
Is there a picture on the left of my slide?

2387
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,220
If I want to change a picture

2388
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,220
Do I pull in a picture?

2389
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:42,220
You see, this picture is different from my original picture

2390
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,220
I had so many neurons in my original picture

2391
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,220
My neurons are now cut off

2392
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,220
What should I do?

2393
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,220
How did this happen?

2394
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:54,220
The reason is because

2395
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,220
All the software

2396
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,220
It's to make sure

2397
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:00,220
It's the same

2398
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:02,220
It's going to add a clipping mask

2399
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,220
I'm going to show you a clipping mask

2400
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:06,220
Double this pattern

2401
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,220
You see, there are two

2402
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,220
The first one is your original picture

2403
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,220
This one

2404
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,220
The second one is your mask

2405
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:16,220
Your mask

2406
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:18,220
You see, I'm going to show you a clipping mask

2407
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:20,220
The part that the mask frames

2408
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,220
It's the last thing that's going to show up

2409
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,220
OK

2410
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:28,220
What about this idea?

2411
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,220
This is our battle

2412
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:32,220
Drawing is the biggest problem with modified timetable

2413
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,220
Look at this

2414
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,220
This picture is just

2415
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,220
From

2416
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,220
Just let it go

2417
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,220
Let's just look at this line

2418
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,220
This line

2419
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,220
When I choose this line now

2420
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:48,220
I can't just choose this line

2421
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,220
Did you notice that I chose this whole thing

2422
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,220
Because the mask of this line is so big

2423
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:56,220
I'm going to move this out now

2424
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,220
Did you see

2425
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,220
When I choose this line

2426
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,220
It's not these anchor points

2427
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,220
It's not a line

2428
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:06,220
But what does this mean

2429
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:08,220
This doesn't mean that my data is so big

2430
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,220
No, this means that my data is

2431
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:12,220
It's just dots and lines

2432
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:14,220
It's just data

2433
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,220
This one outside is its mask

2434
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,220
What can I do now?

2435
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,220
I can double click now

2436
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:22,220
I'm going to double click now

2437
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,220
This thing is what I'm going to do

2438
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,220
This is what we call Compound

2439
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:28,220
OK

2440
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:30,220
I'm using the first arrow now

2441
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,220
I'm going to frame the whole big screen

2442
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:36,220
Then you see

2443
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:38,220
I framed this

2444
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,220
Who is this

2445
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,220
This is this line

2446
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:44,220
Then you see this line

2447
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,220
I moved it out of the clipping mask

2448
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,220
It was cut off

2449
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,220
I don't know if you have this idea

2450
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:52,220
First of all, I'm going to move this over

2451
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:54,220
OK

2452
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,220
You see

2453
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:08,220
I have this thing

2454
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,220
This big mask

2455
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:12,220
And then the data inside

2456
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:14,220
When I'm changing

2457
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,220
I'm going to change the data inside

2458
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,220
So you usually have to point at the data you want to point at

2459
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,220
And then dot dot dot dot

2460
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,220
You see

2461
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:24,220
I clicked a few more times

2462
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:26,220
I finally clicked into this one

2463
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,220
You see if I can see it now

2464
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,220
I zoom in and see if I can see it now

2465
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,220
Circle circle

2466
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,220
This is the image

2467
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:36,220
I finally got this data

2468
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:38,220
I can choose this circle now

2469
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,220
Then you can choose this line

2470
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:42,220
Sometimes you have to click a few more times

2471
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:44,220
Very troublesome

2472
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:46,220
Then I can put this stroke now

2473
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,220
Become more

2474
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,220
Become thinner

2475
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,220
For example, I use 1.75

2476
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:58,220
I like to use 1.75 the most

2477
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,220
Then these circles are the same

2478
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:04,220
You are the same

2479
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:06,220
You don't want it to be so thick

2480
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,220
So you have to go in and choose

2481
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,220
Click a few more times to choose this circle

2482
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,220
Then become 1.75

2483
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:16,220
Change one by one

2484
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:18,220
You see this is actually very troublesome

2485
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:20,220
How do I do this efficiently?

2486
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,220
We may want to take this mask

2487
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,220
I just choose this thing first

2488
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:30,220
Then I'm going to pick up this object

2489
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,220
Right click

2490
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:34,220
Then press this

2491
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,220
I'm going to take this mask off

2492
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:38,220
Take it off

2493
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:40,220
OK, now this thing

2494
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,220
After I re-frame it

2495
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,220
You see, it's completely

2496
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:46,220
These groups of circles and lines

2497
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:50,220
I want to change this thing

2498
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:52,220
It's easier

2499
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:58,220
I can do this

2500
01:50:58,220 --> 01:51:00,220
Then it will wash

2501
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:02,220
I just moved it out

2502
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:04,220
Don't do it when you are doing your own data

2503
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,220
This is ugly

2504
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:08,220
There is a risk of fake data

2505
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,220
I just want to make it easy for you to see the mask

2506
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:12,220
So I just moved it out

2507
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:14,220
Actually, when you are operating

2508
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:16,220
You usually do this

2509
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:18,220
You just choose this

2510
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,220
After choosing this thing

2511
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,220
You just choose your object

2512
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:24,220
Move a little bit first

2513
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,220
Make sure you get it

2514
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:28,220
Then press ctrl-z

2515
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:30,220
Right click, release this mask

2516
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:32,220
When I release the mask

2517
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:34,220
I originally chose an object

2518
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:36,220
You see, there are two boxes

2519
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,220
One is my data line box

2520
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,220
The other is the mask box

2521
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:42,220
Now you can put this mask box

2522
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,220
You can also choose this mask box

2523
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:46,220
Delete it

2524
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,220
I think I chose the wrong one

2525
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,220
Wait a minute

2526
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:56,220
These two

2527
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:58,220
Then I choose this

2528
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:02,220
Delete

2529
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,220
Now this box is gone

2530
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:06,220
I can choose the data I want

2531
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:08,220
Change its appearance

2532
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,220
Like this

2533
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:16,220
The most annoying part of AI

2534
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:18,220
Just look at each of these

2535
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,220
Just this bar

2536
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:22,220
Look at our bar

2537
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:24,220
This bar

2538
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:26,220
It's not like a text

2539
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,220
When you enter the text

2540
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:32,220
Choose the bottom line of the text

2541
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:34,220
It means it's a text

2542
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:36,220
But when you enter

2543
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:38,220
That bar

2544
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:40,220
It becomes an object

2545
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:42,220
It doesn't have that line

2546
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:44,220
And it doesn't have a lot of dots

2547
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:46,220
So it means this thing

2548
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,220
It's also protected by the mask

2549
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,220
Just press the right button

2550
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:52,220
Ok

2551
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:54,220
Sorry

2552
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:56,220
And then the same thing

2553
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,220
Cut off the outline of this bar

2554
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,220
So you can choose

2555
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,220
So when all the software

2556
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:08,220
Enter Illustrator to draw

2557
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:10,220
The most annoying thing is

2558
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:12,220
You have to put every little thing

2559
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,220
The clipping mask is all released

2560
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,220
And then delete those masks

2561
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,220
Delete those masks

2562
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:20,220
And then edit it

2563
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:24,220
And then after this thing

2564
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:28,220
There's something important

2565
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:30,220
A lot of people didn't notice

2566
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:32,220
I want to talk about

2567
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:34,220
After you enter the number

2568
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:36,220
You might have the size

2569
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:38,220
And then you have to output

2570
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,220
And then you have the font

2571
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:42,220
And then you output

2572
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:44,220
And then your picture

2573
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,220
After using another computer

2574
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,220
I found that the font

2575
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,220
I can't find it

2576
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:52,220
But the font is ugly

2577
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:54,220
What should I do

2578
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:56,220
This is a very common problem

2579
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,220
Your computer font

2580
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,220
Windows font

2581
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,220
Mac font

2582
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:04,220
There's a problem when you switch

2583
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,220
So the best way at this time

2584
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,220
You type all the words

2585
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,220
For example, this bar

2586
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:12,220
I have a number

2587
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,220
After I type it

2588
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:16,220
You circle all these words

2589
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:18,220
Right click

2590
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:20,220
Then click Create Outline

2591
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,220
I'll zoom in for you

2592
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:26,220
This bar is just a bar

2593
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:28,220
It's a text

2594
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:30,220
After I create it

2595
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,220
It's not a text

2596
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,220
I'm using this A

2597
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:38,220
Look at this picture

2598
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,220
It's not a text anymore

2599
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,220
It's a lot of dots

2600
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,220
Look at this picture

2601
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,220
It's already a text

2602
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,220
When you output it on a different computer

2603
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,220
There will be no font

2604
01:54:50,220 --> 01:54:52,220
Unreadable problem

2605
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:04,220
Understand

2606
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:06,220
And then the audience

2607
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:08,220
Someone said

2608
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:10,220
That is

2609
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:12,220
You can see more clearly

2610
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,220
Masks and objects

2611
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:16,220
Layer management

2612
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:18,220
Yes, there is a layer management

2613
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:20,220
There is a layer management

2614
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:22,220
You can

2615
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:24,220
You put everything on different layers

2616
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,220
You can see the objects

2617
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:30,220
But I rarely use this

2618
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,220
I personally rarely use this feature

2619
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:34,220
I don't remember

2620
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:36,220
How to set up layers

2621
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:38,220
But if you're interested

2622
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,220
There are a lot of layers

2623
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:42,220
I suggest you

2624
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:44,220
Go to YouTube

2625
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,220
Lastly

2626
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:52,220
I'll end the meeting here

2627
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:54,220
But we can continue

2628
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:56,220
To ask questions

2629
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:00,220
I'll bother the teacher

2630
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,220
Until she can't

2631
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,220
Because there are too many questions

2632
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:06,220
If I can't, I'll

2633
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:08,220
That's all

2634
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,220
Bye
