1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am the host today, Li Yuejia, and I am very happy that everyone is here to participate in today's talk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's speaker is Chen Hongren, who is currently studying a doctorate degree at Amsterdam University.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He said that his original goal was to become a magical baby master, but when he came back, he was already on his way to medical school and medical school.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
His main topic is the immune response of giant cells.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The topic ranges from animal modeling, infectious diseases to cancer, as well as substance immune diseases.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So it's actually quite broad.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In addition to animal experiment models and molecular biology, he also does big data analysis, including genes, transmission, protein, metabolism, and metabolism.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So in fact, his field of research is very broad, and I think it's very impressive.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In addition to the lab, he often appears in the kitchen, gym, mountain, or all kinds of water areas.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I think he said he was A-zai, but I don't think he looks like A-zai.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is his personal self-introduction.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If there are people in the same field of research or people who are interested in his field of research, they can interact with him after the speech or exchange opinions.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
His speech topic today is COVID-19, the early antibody-forming immune compound that causes the excessive immune response of giant cells.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll leave the speech to Peng Ren.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you for the introduction.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know if you can see it.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you have any questions, you can tell me anytime.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because I'm afraid if you're lost in the middle, you might not be able to listen.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
As I said, the topic I'm going to talk about today is COVID-19, the immune response that it causes in our body, and why it can cause more serious symptoms.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Today is March 14th, which is the day of the International Ape Day.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So I think it's quite interesting.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let me introduce who I am.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in Taiwan.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am now a PhD student at the Amsterdam Institute of Medicine.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My main fields of research are immunology, molecular biology, transferology, and biophysics.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The main topic of our group is giant cells.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My boss specializes in arteriosclerosis.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My main field of research is the immune response of immune cells.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I also work on the immune system.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you're interested in these fields or want to work with me,

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I usually want to connect with you through LinkedIn or Twitter.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have a QR code below.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you're interested in hiking, anime, or want to get to know new friends,

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you can find me on Facebook at the bottom right.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, so...

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you look at my resume, you might think,

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
since my boss specializes in arteriosclerosis,

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
why would I introduce COVID-19 today?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The story begins with something that happened last year.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In 2019, as you know, COVID-19 broke out.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When COVID-19 broke out,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know why, but there was a barrier in Taiwan.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It was different from other parts of the world.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In Holland, where I live,

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the virus spread and the city was closed down.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So you couldn't go to the lab unless you were doing research on COVID-19.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Obviously, my condition at the time was...

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I couldn't complete my thesis.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I discussed with my boss...

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because my topic is different from others in our group.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I rarely do cardiomyopathy.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't have an arteriosclerosis project.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I tend to focus on pure immunity.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So I asked my boss if we could do some research on COVID-19.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
On the one hand, it's a good opportunity to do research on immunology.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
On the other hand, I want to end the pandemic as soon as possible.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So we started our COVID-19 research project.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The main topic of my talk today

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
is a preprint we published last year.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Basically, it's about...

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Antibodies and viruses form immune compounds.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
These immune compounds stimulate cells in the body

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and cause severe over-immunity response.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This preprint is being reviewed now.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We also published another preprint with other collaborators.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's based on this preprint.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We first observed some characteristics in clinical trials.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then we decided to translate it into a cell model.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to focus on these two preprints today.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you're interested in COVID-19,

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think it's worth taking a look at.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
First, let's talk about COVID-19.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
As you know, it's a severe respiratory infection.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In the early days of the outbreak,

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
people were already studying the symptoms.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are the symptoms

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that led to such a severe infection?

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's 3 p.m. in the afternoon in Tainan.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's 3.09 p.m.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sorry for the interruption.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm going to publish a preprint.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, sorry.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's my nature.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So...

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Where was I?

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, so it's a process of immune response.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As you can see,

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in the early days of COVID-19,

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the virus hadn't spread yet,

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
but it was already infected.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then the virus increased.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But at that time,

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
there wasn't a lot of response.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then at stage 2,

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
there was some immune response,

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and it started to spread.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But the spread wasn't that strong at first.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But because of the immune response,

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
the virus decreased.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's the orange line in the middle.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then the strange thing is that

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
as the virus decreased,

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the immune response also increased.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is actually interesting.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You'd expect that

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you have a pathogen today,

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and your body needs to spread to fight it.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But in fact,

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
regardless of the death rate,

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the survival rate,

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or the immune response,

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
it all started to show up

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when the virus decreased.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A very important time point is this,

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
when seroconversion occurs.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is seroconversion?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Take a look.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me turn on a laser.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Is there a way to turn on a laser?

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you can see here,

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
this time point is when

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the antibodies in your blood

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
can start to be detected.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Even though you may have

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
antibodies in the early stages,

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
at this time point,

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the antibodies in your blood

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
start to change from negative to positive.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is seroconversion.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
At this time point,

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
your antibodies reach a detectable level.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is very interesting.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's interesting is

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
when antibodies start to be produced,

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the immune response starts to increase.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then the death rate increases.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is very interesting.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So researchers have been studying

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the overall profile of patients

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and their overall condition.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
One way to do this is

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to measure various substances in the blood,

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
such as inflammation index, and so on.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They found that

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
at first,

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it was more likely to be seroconversion.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Later on,

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the number of seroconversions increased,

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and then the more annoying immune response started.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
During this time,

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
a lot of cell hormones are produced.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There are several types of cell hormones

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that are more noticeable.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's mentioned here.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
TNF,

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Tumor Necrosis Factor.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a tumor necrosis factor.

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There are also

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
seroconversion 1 and seroconversion 6.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There is also

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
MCP1,

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
single-nucleotide degenerative protein.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
These are the several types of cell hormones.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They are very important

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
during this time.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It doesn't matter

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the cause or the result.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
During this time,

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the patient will have

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
a higher number of these cell hormones.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So,

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you might ask

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which type of cell

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
these cell hormones are produced from.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Some reviews show

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that these cell hormones are

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
produced by

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
cells in the human body.

181
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
These cell hormones

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
are called macrophages.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They can produce

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
a large number of these cell hormones.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As I mentioned earlier,

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
macrophages 6,

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
IL-6,

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Tumor Necrosis Factor,

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
TNF,

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
IL-10,

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
IL-8,

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
these cell hormones.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This chart is a bit complicated.

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
To put it simply,

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
today,

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we have a SARS-CoV-2

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
virus infection.

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Today,

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
we are infected

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
with SARS-CoV-2,

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
the Wuhan pneumonia.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It will stimulate the

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
macrophages in the body,

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
which are called

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
macrophages,

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or macrophages called

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
macrophages,

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
or macrophages,

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or macrophages.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
These macrophages

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
will produce

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a large number of

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
cell hormones.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
These cell hormones,

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
if they are in

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
a relatively local range,

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
will cause

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
local inflammation,

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
inflammatory response,

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which is

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
local inflammation.

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For example,

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
for example,

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we might have pneumonia.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
These people

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
will talk a lot,

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
these things.

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is more serious

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
is that these cell hormones

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
produced locally

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
through blood

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
will cause

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
a more systematic

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
inflammatory response

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
after reaching the body.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This systematic inflammatory response

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is called

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
cell hormone storm.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This thing

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
may cause

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
multiple organ failure

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
because it may

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
cause hemorrhoids,

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
various

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
unnecessary

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
immune responses.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This will

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
eventually lead to

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
death.

250
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So,

251
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
macrophages

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
may play a very,

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
very important role

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
in this

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
disease worsening process.

256
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I just talked about

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
so many macrophages.

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What are

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
macrophages?

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Macrophages,

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to name a few,

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is a cell

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that swallows

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and eats a lot.

265
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Right.

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Its role

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is to

268
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
eliminate

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
pathogens

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
by eating

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
or eliminating

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
pathogens

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
or cleaning the battlefield.

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If there is a serious

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
inflammatory response today,

276
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and a lot of cells

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
die,

278
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
macrophages

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
will

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
act

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
on the battlefield.

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So,

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it will

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
eat

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
these dead cells

286
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
digest them.

288
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the most direct function

290
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of macrophages.

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So,

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
at first,

293
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we need to

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
understand it.

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What parts of the body

296
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
have macrophages?

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In fact,

298
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
macrophages are

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
a very wide

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
group of cells.

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Basically,

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
they appear in

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
various organs of the human body.

304
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
For example,

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in the brain,

306
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
there is

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
a cell group

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
called microglia

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
called microglia.

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This microglia

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is also

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a type of macrophage.

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Of course,

314
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
liver,

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
immune system,

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and even

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
your bone marrow

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
all have macrophages.

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Today,

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
we will focus on

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
macrophages in the lungs,

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
which are

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
alveolar macrophages,

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
which are

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
lung-cancer macrophages.

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes,

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
this is

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
what we will

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
talk about today.

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Macrophages,

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
as I said just now,

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
you may think

333
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
they are

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
responsible for

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
cleaning the battlefield

337
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
or eating

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the pathogen.

339
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But it's not that simple.

340
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Macrophages

341
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
actually have many functions.

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just imagine

343
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
they are

345
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
an important member

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
of the

347
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
adenovirus immune system.

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That means

349
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
they have the ability

350
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to detect

351
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the pathogen

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and know

353
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
who the pathogen is.

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Another thing is

355
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you can imagine

357
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the cells

359
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
in a person's body

360
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
are not

361
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
our own cells.

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The cells in our body

363
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
are bacteria.

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So you can imagine

365
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that you don't want

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the tissues

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
all over your body

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
all day long,

369
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
especially the skin

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and mucous membranes,

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to get inflammation all day long.

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You want them

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
to detect

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the harmful bacteria

375
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and know

376
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
who their neighbors are.

377
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Right.

378
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So

379
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
macrophages

380
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
play a very important role

381
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
in this process.

382
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They can

383
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
be agglomerated

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
or agglomerated

385
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
into

386
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
a more

387
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
proliferative macrophage.

388
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or they can

389
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
be de-proliferated

390
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
into a

391
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
macrophage

392
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that eliminates

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the proliferative reaction.

394
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This process

395
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is called agglomeration.

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you can imagine

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that

398
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the macrophages

399
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in our body

400
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that eliminate

401
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the proliferative reaction

402
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
can be agglomerated

403
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
into a more

404
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
aggressive

405
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and proliferative

406
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
macrophage

407
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
when we

408
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
encounter

409
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
a truly harmful

410
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
macrophage.

411
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When we

412
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
de-proliferate

413
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the macrophage,

414
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
it can be agglomerated

415
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
into

416
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
a more

417
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
anti-inflammatory

418
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
macrophage.

419
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So it can

420
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
be

421
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
de-proliferated.

422
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So here's the question.

423
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is it like

424
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
a baby bottle?

425
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It can be

426
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
a variety of things.

427
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Actually,

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it's not.

429
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A macrophage is

430
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
more like a baby bottle.

431
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What do I mean?

432
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you give it

433
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
something

434
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
that stimulates

435
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the immune response,

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
for example,

437
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the example on the slide

438
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
is LPS,

439
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Polyis,

440
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and Interferon,

441
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
which is a

442
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
component of

443
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
bacteria,

444
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
cells,

445
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
or a genetic material

446
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
similar to

447
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
a virus,

448
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
or a disruptor,

449
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
which is

450
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
a hormone

451
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that secretes

452
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
when a cell is infected.

453
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It can be

454
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
de-proliferated

455
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
into

456
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
a more

457
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
anti-inflammatory

458
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
macrophage.

459
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
On the contrary,

460
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
when

461
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the environment

462
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
tells you

463
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
that you shouldn't

464
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
de-proliferate,

465
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and that

466
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
there are

467
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
a lot of

468
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
de-proliferative

469
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
4 and de-proliferative

470
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
10,

471
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
which is

472
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
IL-4,

473
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
IL-10,

474
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
or

475
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you've taken

476
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
lipoprotein,

477
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
which suppresses

478
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the immune response,

479
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
then these

480
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
compounds

481
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
will turn

482
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
macrophages

483
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
into

484
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
macrophages.

485
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But we can imagine

486
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that it's impossible

487
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to be so simple

488
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
in the human body.

489
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So, in fact,

490
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in the human body,

491
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we

492
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
have

493
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
all kinds

494
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
of

495
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
macrophages.

496
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is

497
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
because we know

498
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that we can

499
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
separate

500
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
macrophages

501
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
from each other

502
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
in the body

503
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
or in the body,

504
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
but there must be

505
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
some macrophages

506
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that we don't

507
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
know about.

508
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is

509
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
what's

510
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
interesting

511
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
about

512
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
macrophages.

513
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
To do this,

514
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to do this experiment,

515
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the first thing

516
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we need to do

517
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
is to build

518
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
a cell model

519
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that can simulate

520
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
macrophages

521
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and macrophages

522
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
so that

523
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
we can

524
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
use clinical samples

525
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
in molecular biology

526
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and then

527
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
find possible

528
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
macrophages.

529
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

530
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So,

531
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
at this time,

532
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
we have to

533
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
figure out

534
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
how to define

535
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
macrophages

536
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
in macrophages

537
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and find out

538
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
what kind of

539
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
macrophages

540
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
they look like.

541
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So,

542
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
we did a

543
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
meta-analysis.

544
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Um,

545
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
meta-analysis is Chinese.

546
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Anyway,

547
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
we did a meta-analysis.

548
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So,

549
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
um,

550
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the idea is that

551
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
we know

552
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that there are

553
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
different labs

554
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that use

555
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
different

556
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
different

557
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
cell technologies

558
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or something.

559
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We're going to find out

560
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
if there is

561
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
a special characteristic

562
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
of a cell technology.

563
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No matter how

564
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
strange the cell looks,

565
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
as long as there is

566
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
this characteristic,

567
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
it means that

568
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it has been

569
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
activated by

570
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
a certain cell technology.

571
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So,

572
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
if you are

573
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
interested in this article,

574
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
it was published

575
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
in 2019

576
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in Frontier Immunology.

577
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Anyway,

578
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
we used

579
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
machine learning

580
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to identify

581
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a group of

582
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
cells

583
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that looked

584
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
like

585
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
lung-like

586
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
macrophages.

587
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Anyway,

588
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
let's take a look at

589
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
this one.

590
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We did

591
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
four different

592
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
studies

593
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and found

594
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
four different

595
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
samples.

596
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We found that

597
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
lung-like

598
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
macrophages

599
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
are actually

600
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
modified

601
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
macrophages.

602
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So,

603
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
we used this

604
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
as our

605
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
research model.

606
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We used

607
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
IL-10 to

608
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
polarize

609
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the macrophages

610
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to simulate

611
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
lung-like

612
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
macrophages.

613
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Now,

614
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
we have a model

615
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that is in the lungs.

616
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So,

617
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we want to know

618
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
why

619
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
this cell technology

620
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
storm

621
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
may be

622
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
from

623
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
macrophages.

624
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why

625
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
did it

626
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
start

627
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
during the

628
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
atherosclerosis?

629
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Why did it

630
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
start during

631
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the decline

632
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
of the virus

633
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and the immune

634
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
response

635
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to trigger

636
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
this cell

637
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
technology storm?

638
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go back

639
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to this

640
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
disease layer.

641
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As I said,

642
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
this is a

643
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
hemoglobin transfer period.

644
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The virus

645
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
is declining

646
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and the

647
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
hemoglobin

648
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
is rising.

649
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why

650
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
is the

651
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
antibody

652
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
produced

653
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
at this time?

654
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is

655
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
what we

656
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
define as

657
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
seroconversion.

658
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is

659
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
IgM and

660
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
IgG.

661
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
These are

662
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
the two

663
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
of the

664
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
five

665
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
types of

666
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
antibodies.

667
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IgM is

668
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
a relatively

669
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
large antibody.

670
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It was first

671
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
produced

672
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
in the

673
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
early stage

674
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
of the

675
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
disease.

676
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then,

677
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
another

678
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
antibody

679
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
called

680
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
IgG

681
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and

682
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IgA

683
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
was

684
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
produced

685
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
after

686
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
IgG.

687
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
As you can

688
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
see,

689
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
the statistical

690
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
results

691
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
are getting

692
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
more and more

693
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
consistent.

694
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
As I said,

695
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
IgM is

696
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
an antibody

697
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
produced

698
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
in the

699
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
early stage

700
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
of the

701
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
disease.

702
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We

703
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
speculated

704
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
that

705
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
IgG

706
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
is

707
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
more

708
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
related

709
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to

710
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
IgG

711
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
than

712
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
IgM.

713
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The first

714
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
question is

715
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
whether

716
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the

717
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
IgG

718
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
antibody

719
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
has a

720
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
serious

721
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
effect.

722
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's

723
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
look at

724
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the

725
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
clinical

726
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
results.

727
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes,

728
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
we have

729
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
studied

730
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
many

731
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
samples

732
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
in the

733
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Netherlands

734
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
this year.

735
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The patient

736
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
on the

737
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
left

738
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
is

739
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
infected

740
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
with

741
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
COVID-19

742
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
but

743
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the

744
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
symptoms

745
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
are

746
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
mild.

747
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The

748
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
patient

749
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
on the

750
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
right

751
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is

752
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000

COVID-19

755
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but

756
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
the

757
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
symptoms

758
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
are

759
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
mild.

760
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The

761
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
patient on

762
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the

764
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000

765
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
mild.

773
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The

784
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
are

785
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
mild.

786
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The

are

798

1013
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
These

1017
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the

1018
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000

1023
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You

1024
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
can

1025
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
imagine

1026
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that

1027
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
this

1029
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
the

1037
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This is

1038
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
an

1039
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
interesting observation.

1040
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If

1041
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
we give

1042
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
an

1052
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This

1053
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is

1054
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
a

1057
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We

1058
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
want to

1059
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
know

1060
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
what

1061
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
the

1064
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000

1068
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So

1069
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
today

1070
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
we

1071
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
used water

1072
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000

1083
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000

3304
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
were

3305
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000

3306
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
conscious
