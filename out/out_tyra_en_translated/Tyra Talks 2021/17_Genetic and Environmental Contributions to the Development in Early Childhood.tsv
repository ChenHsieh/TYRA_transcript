0	7000	I'm going to share my screen first.
7000	9000	You can share your screen at the same time, no problem.
9000	10000	Okay, cool.
10000	11000	Thank you.
11000	23000	We are really happy to have Yichi as our speaker today.
23000	29000	Yichi Hong is currently a second-year PhD student at Boston University.
29000	34000	Coincidentally, she studied psychology at Taiwan University.
34000	37000	She studied psychology at Taiwan University.
37000	40000	She has worked in two different research institutes.
40000	42000	One is a research institute run by Dr. Reagan Lin.
42000	44000	The other is a research institute run by Dr. Wu Wen-Chi.
44000	48000	She mainly studies behavioral coding and research methods related to FMRI.
48000	50000	Yichi is amazing.
50000	52000	She graduated three years in advance.
52000	56000	After graduation, she became a research assistant for two years.
56000	61000	Now, she has applied to Boston University for research.
61000	68000	Her research focuses on the characteristics of adult anti-social behavior that can be observed in childhood.
68000	72000	She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.
72000	76000	She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.
76000	83000	Today, we will hear some research related to FMRI, behavioral inheritance, and so on.
83000	87000	I will introduce Yichi to you.
87000	90000	Let's give Yichi the floor.
90000	96000	Welcome, Yichi.
96000	98000	Please start.
98000	100000	Thank you for the introduction.
100000	102000	Behavioral inheritance is a difficult topic.
102000	107000	I will not talk about the research related to FMRI today.
107000	109000	I will start.
110000	112000	I am Yichi Hong.
112000	114000	I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.
114000	116000	I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.
116000	121000	My research focuses on the development of children before puberty.
121000	126000	We can estimate the impact of genes and the environment on behavior.
126000	130000	In a group, we can see the difference in individual behavior.
130000	133000	How many percentages can be explained by genes or the environment?
134000	140000	I will talk about behavioral inheritance and how to do it.
140000	143000	I will talk about the assumption and basic model of FMRI.
143000	151000	I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.
151000	156000	I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.
156000	159000	We did not control or manipulate any of the changes.
159000	162000	We did not secretly send twins to different families.
162000	164000	We did not secretly send twins to different families.
166000	172000	Behavioral inheritance aims to answer a big question in psychology or philosophy.
172000	176000	The question is whether human behavior is decided by God or God.
176000	182000	Plato and Aristotle had different opinions on this question.
182000	186000	Plato thought that human behavior was decided by God.
186000	189000	Everyone was born with different abilities.
193000	199000	Aristotle thought that human behavior was created by God.
199000	201000	Everyone was born with a white paper.
201000	206000	The structure of society or education is the most important factor in our behavior.
206000	210000	We also saw this in the time of Simon.
210000	213000	We also saw this in the time of Simon.
213000	219000	Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.
219000	224000	Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.
224000	227000	Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.
232000	235000	Testamentians felt that human beings should have some talents.
235000	238000	They felt that human beings should have some talents.
238000	239000	It's Universalism.
239000	240000	But what is the current psychology on these issues?
240000	242000	But what is the current psychology on these issues?
242000	244000	We have been walking along a middle path quite sufficiently.
244000	246000	We felt that genes and environment
246000	248000	We felt that genes and environment
248000	250000	and others are responsible for human behavior.
250000	252880	We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.
252880	257000	We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.
257000	262000	Through personalities in different religions
262000	264000	through personalities in different religions
264000	268000	we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.
268000	270040	we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.
270040	271040	Human is a sediment different environment
271080	273200	There are some unfavorable examples that we find on sexual environment,
273200	274200	The first thing is family study
274200	276200	people in Taiwan has monogamy books
276200	278200	We have now standardized this information
278200	280200	We have now standardized this information
280200	282200	we have now standardized this information
282200	284200	family study looks like
284200	286200	family study looks like
286200	288200	Although it is shown by numbers
288200	290200	children are more likely to be sexually transmitted
290200	292200	Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted
292200	294200	The ratio of genes divided by family is high
294200	296700	Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted
327040	329040	the environment of each generation will be different
329040	331040	the environment of each generation will be different
331040	333040	The information on different generations, as mentioned before, varies from generation to generation
333040	335040	However, DNA definition should only be applied in children
335040	337040	However, DNA definition should only be applied in children
337040	341620	The ideal condition is to find тур
341620	343620	The task of double third-party studies is a good source of the teacher
343620	345140	the task of double third-party studies is a good source of the feeder
345140	347140	they are born almost the same time
347140	349140	you can see the picture
349140	351140	They are the same sex
351140	353140	they are the same sex
353140	355140	genes are 100% connected
356040	357920	10% of twins, mother and childω
357920	359920	10% of twins, mother and childω
359920	361920	10% of twins, mother and childω
361920	363920	10% of twins, mother and childω
363920	365920	10% of twins, mother and childω
365920	367920	they often havesoft egg
367920	369920	they often have soft egg
369920	371920	they can be more close in relationship
371920	373920	they can be more close in relationship
373920	375920	they can be more close in relationship
375920	377920	when they share the 100%
377920	379860	thus 50%
379860	380060	he can then estimate the influence with document
380060	382060	thus 50%
382060	384060	hence 50%
384060	384920	and the impact will be still small
385600	387360	that is a limitation of the research
387360	390900	even they have good genetic analysis
390900	392260	but it is hard to control the enviornment
392260	393900	then collectively
393900	395300	the research of pig breeding
395300	396700	has better analysis of the envientos
396700	398280	as you can see in this diagram
398280	399780	the research of children breeding
399780	401760	and the parents who breed
401760	402900	the similarities between them
402900	403860	can be explain in Template 0
403860	404860	can be explain in Template 0
404860	406480	they share the enviornment
407140	409180	the relationship between childrens and parents
409180	410580	the relationship between children and parents
410580	413160	that is related with their genes
413760	415280	but the influence of the same generation
415280	417640	can be seen in the design of the research
418520	420560	so the most perfect state
420560	423200	should be when we study the twins who are adopted
423200	425240	but the limitation of the research
425240	427160	is that it is hard to collect such data
427160	429040	the database I know in the world
429040	430120	should be one in Sweden
430120	431200	and one in Minnesota
431200	433360	so the limitation is that it is hard to collect the data
434600	437040	the above is the method of measurement
437040	438800	that is we can't directly see
438800	439880	which DNA
439880	441920	has influence on the behavior
442840	444480	but with the development of biotechnology
444480	446920	we can directly see the information in DNA
446920	448240	but I am not familiar with this
448240	449920	so I will simply divide it into
449920	451920	theoretical and atheoretical
451920	453080	to introduce to you
453080	454360	the former is like
454360	456480	candidate genes
456480	457320	for example
457320	459640	today I want to see the behavior of adulteration
459640	460680	then I will study
460680	462040	the genes related to the多巴胺
462040	462600	because we know that
462600	463960	the rejuvenation mechanism and adulteration
463960	465600	are closely related
465960	467640	so we will first select some genes
467640	469720	then put the focus on these genes
469720	471480	to see the variances of these genes
471480	472960	and the variances of the behavior
472960	473880	are they related
474800	476000	but now this method
476000	476640	is a little bit
477520	478360	unknown
478360	479080	because
479080	479800	human behavior
479800	480600	doesn't look like
480600	482360	there is a small part of genes
482360	484120	and then there is a huge amount of effect
484120	485480	to explain those behaviors
485480	486000	but
486000	487600	more like there are many many genes
487600	488880	and then their effect is very small
488880	489960	and then pile up
490440	491240	so
491240	492880	through the method of candidate genes
492880	494000	we can currently
494000	495440	explain
495440	497480	the behavior variation is about 1% to 5%
497480	498280	that kind of variation
498280	499400	and we use the previous
499440	500160	mentioned
500160	502160	quantitative behavioral genetics
502160	503040	to get the
503040	504160	estimate value
504160	505360	there is a big gap
506240	507240	so later
507240	508200	molecular biologists
508200	510200	or molecular bio-hereditary behaviorists
510200	512000	they use a more violent method
512000	513360	that is not to assume
513360	514520	and then go to GWAS
514520	516640	directly analyze all the DNA sequences
516640	518200	that can see a lot of nucleotides
518200	518720	that is
518720	520120	the ACTG in DNA
520120	520840	these sequences
521480	522760	and then we will go to see
523400	524320	these nucleotides
524800	526440	we will go through their
526480	528480	variance
528480	530040	and then go to some numbers
530040	531360	and then stack it up
531360	532360	and then go to see this
532360	532760	number
532760	534760	is it related to the behavior we are interested in
534760	535960	that this is the current
536640	539520	method of molecular bio-hereditary behavior
539520	540400	but the difficulties encountered
540400	541880	is that there are quite a few
541880	543680	that is, it takes about a few million
543680	544360	to be able to
544360	546280	estimate some more effective results
546760	547200	that
547200	548680	another question
548680	549360	is
549360	550080	just talked about
550080	550800	they are through
550800	551720	the effect of nucleotides
551720	552840	stacked up
552840	553640	so
553640	554280	this paper
554280	555160	they are looking at
555160	556040	intelligence
556040	556920	is intelligence
556920	557440	this
557960	558720	feature
558720	559200	that
559200	559960	assume that
559960	562040	the variance between the groups
562040	563080	is 100%
563080	563840	and then go through
563840	564360	nucleotides
564360	565400	to estimate out of the value
565400	566200	is probably
566200	567160	genes can probably explain
567160	568200	50% of the mutations
569120	570480	but by stacking this method
570480	571160	we can calculate
571160	571800	it can explain
571800	573240	about only 25%
573240	573600	that
573600	574440	the difference in the middle
574440	575200	represents what
575200	575680	it means
575680	576840	these genes may not be
576840	578440	a linear effect that can be stacked up
578440	579360	but
579360	580600	they will be related
580600	581440	or interaction
581440	581960	and so on
581960	582360	so
582360	583800	how to calculate
583800	584800	those genome score
584800	585240	that is
586160	587120	the direction of future efforts
589800	590120	yes
591400	592560	the above is a brief introduction
592560	593640	I want to stop
593640	595400	to see if you have any questions
595400	595760	and then
595760	596400	if you have any questions
596400	598080	you can directly turn on the microphone
600080	600760	then welcome everyone
600760	602080	directly turn on the microphone
602080	602800	to ask questions
602800	604120	or if everyone
604560	605000	is
605000	606520	you can also use chat
606520	607080	that I can
607080	607680	is to help you
608360	609480	help you with the speaker
609480	610640	is to ask
610640	611080	the other
611080	612920	if you have any questions
612920	613640	also welcome everyone
613640	614200	is a little
614200	614720	one sentence
614720	616360	can simply introduce yourself
616360	617680	you can get to know each other
617680	618160	thank you
622160	623360	that if there is no problem
623360	623960	is here
623960	624800	want to emphasize
624800	625400	is that every method
625400	626640	of some restrictions
626640	627320	but did not have
627320	628440	a perfect research design
628440	629280	so behavioral genetics
629280	631000	can be integrated through different methods
631000	632160	and then go to see a
632160	632800	more stable
632800	633600	can be found
633600	634080	trend
634080	634560	like this
638360	639040	then we look at
639040	640080	behavioral genetics
640080	640600	I will be here
640600	642040	with the example of biopsy research
642040	642400	that he
642400	642640	in the end
642640	643320	how to study
643320	645040	the impact of genes and the environment
645040	646040	on the concept
646040	646440	is the same
646440	647480	we look at
647480	649120	the relationship between individual genes
649120	650320	with the relationship on the behavior
650320	651160	that if this relationship
651160	652160	is significant, then
652160	653080	we will say
653080	653920	genes for us
653920	655000	are interested in this behavior
655000	656520	has a certain degree of impact
656520	657080	and then we
657080	658400	here to measure a biological term
658400	659400	called heritability
659400	660160	it refers to
660160	662280	how many degrees
662280	663080	in the observed behavioral mutation
663080	664680	can be explained by genes
664680	666240	but because this is a method of measurement
666240	666880	so specific
666880	667720	in the end what is the gene
667720	668880	we have no way to know
670160	671680	that part of the environment
671680	672960	we can further
672960	674080	divide into shared
674080	675720	and non-shared environment
675720	676640	that first talk about
676640	677720	the shared environment
677720	679320	it refers to the environment
679320	679960	those individuals
679960	681840	they experience the same factors
681840	682680	and these factors
682680	684120	will make the individual
684120	684960	for example, like
684960	685480	twins
685480	687560	their social status in the family
687560	688480	living in the community
688480	690440	or culture, etc.
690440	691880	on the other hand,
691880	692880	non-shared environment
692880	693600	as the name implies
693600	694760	is the environment
694760	695320	each individual
695320	696840	unique experience
696840	697960	and these unique experiences
697960	698640	in theory
698640	700160	will cause differences between individuals
700160	700560	such as
701080	701600	accidents
701600	703720	or miscalculations, etc.
703720	704640	so just like today
704640	705360	a pair of twins
705360	706040	if there is a person
706040	706880	with COVID
706880	707480	cough
707480	708320	the other person does not
708320	709560	then they sleep in different rooms
709560	710360	one person will be sick
710360	711320	one person will not
711320	712120	so although they are
712120	712920	twins
712920	713960	but their life experience
713960	715480	will not be exactly the same
715480	716480	or say
716480	718560	they are in the uterus
718560	719920	the position of the left bed is different
719920	720920	maybe one is above
720920	721800	one is below
721800	722520	so
722520	723440	the difference in the environment
723440	724480	will not be born to them
724480	725120	early birth
725120	727120	that physical development
727120	727920	is there any impact
727920	728400	that
728400	729880	this is also possible to cause
729880	731080	different factors
731080	732440	of same-egg twins
735040	735480	specifically
735480	737040	how do we calculate it
737040	738000	is that we are through
738000	739080	the similarity between individual
739080	740600	and behavior
740600	742160	that is to collect some
742160	743280	correlation
743280	744040	so we will collect
744040	745040	their behavioral data
745040	746680	and then in the model
746680	747160	we will have
747160	748840	twin 1 and twin 2
748840	749600	in this order
749600	750320	we will try to
750320	751600	we will randomize
751600	753160	to reduce some errors
754240	754760	ok
755800	756960	and then in the model
756960	758400	we will put three factors
758400	759400	that is
759400	760040	gene
760040	761360	and then the shared environment
761360	762800	and the non-shared environment
762800	763520	and then we will try
763520	764480	to use these three factors
764480	765120	to predict
765120	766560	their behavioral mutations
766560	767360	like this
767360	767520	ok
767520	768120	that
768120	769080	part of the parameters
769080	770720	is our assumption
770720	770920	ok
770920	772880	then we start from the gene
772880	774200	for same-egg twins
774200	774720	that is
774720	776040	monozygotic twins
776040	777240	so they are mz
777240	778240	that because they share
778240	779360	100% of the gene
779360	780200	so we will
780200	781520	put the correlation here
781520	781960	is 1
781960	782800	assume
782800	784120	the two genes
784120	784560	um
784560	785160	the impression
785160	786360	is exactly the same
787240	787720	ok
787720	789160	what about monozygotic twins
789160	789600	that is
789600	790840	dizygotic twins
790840	792200	they share
792200	794040	50% of the gene on average
794040	794200	oh
794200	795240	the gene here refers to
795240	797480	the 1.3% gene unique to humans
797480	798200	because we share with
798200	799280	black stars
799280	800880	98.7%
800880	801240	ok
801240	801720	so
801720	802120	that is
802120	803200	for monozygotic twins
803200	803800	this factor
803800	805040	we will put 0.5
805040	805440	as
805440	807240	the parameter in our model
807240	807920	ok
807920	808320	that
808320	809440	shared environment
809440	810440	because they will all
810440	811880	grow up in the same family
811880	812360	so
812360	812920	for
812920	814120	same-egg and monozygotic twins
814120	814800	we assume
814800	815680	this shared environment
815680	817320	has the same impact on them
817320	818360	so we will
818360	819520	put 1
819520	821120	as their correlation
821120	821680	and
821680	822160	in addition
822160	823840	in the non-shared environment
823840	825240	there is no assumption
825240	825880	because
825880	826160	um
826160	827280	for each individual
827280	828480	logically
828480	829360	it is unique
829360	829800	so we will
829800	830840	make it an independent event
831920	832200	and
832200	833120	put it here
833120	833960	if you have studied
833960	835160	psychology-related courses
835160	836320	you may have a little impression
836320	837080	formula
837080	837560	so
837560	838360	we just talked about
838360	838920	our analysis
838920	839360	is to analyze
839360	841080	the correlation between twins
841080	841920	so we will say
841920	842520	that
842520	844440	usually the correlation between twins
844440	844920	cause
844920	845880	the reason for this correlation
845880	846360	is because
846360	847200	they have 100%
847200	848160	the same genes
848160	848800	and 100%
848800	850080	the same environment
850080	850320	so
850320	851040	the correlation between
851040	851960	the same-egg and monozygotic twins
851960	852800	will be
852800	854400	half of the same genes
854400	855000	plus
855000	855440	their
855440	855960	100%
855960	856760	the same environment
856760	857840	to explain
857840	858160	and
858160	858840	it should be quite obvious
858840	859520	that
859520	859840	for
859840	861440	the prediction of the non-shared environment
861440	862080	we will
862080	863040	subtract the correlation between
863040	863840	the same-egg and monozygotic twins
863840	864600	by 1
868720	868960	so
868960	869280	next
869280	870320	I want to share
870320	871520	this paper
871520	871880	um
871880	872560	this paper
872560	872800	is written by
872800	874040	Robin Pullman
874040	874320	and
874320	874920	he should be
874920	875960	the most famous
875960	877120	behavioral geneticist
877120	877600	at least
877600	878240	in psychology
878240	879200	it's like this
879200	879400	so
879400	880120	if you are interested
880120	881000	you can look it up
881000	882040	he listed 10 points
882040	882640	that can be stabilized
882640	883320	by replicating
883320	883840	some
883840	884600	results
884600	884800	so
884800	886080	I will talk about two
886080	886480	um
886480	887160	the first one
887160	889320	I want you to guess
889320	891080	how much of human intelligence
891080	892800	can be determined by genes
892800	893520	and
893520	893800	um
893800	895200	in the process of growth
895200	896480	the part that genes can explain
896480	897800	will change over time
897800	898680	or less
898680	899080	and
899080	899720	I'll give you
899720	900480	10 seconds
900480	901640	to guess
901640	902520	in your heart
905960	906480	ok
906480	906760	so
906760	907000	um
907000	907680	this result
907680	908200	is a
908200	909080	meta-analysis
909080	909560	so
909560	910160	they
910160	911000	compared
911000	911400	in
911400	912080	childhood
912080	912800	adolescence
912800	913200	and
913200	913960	early adulthood
913960	914600	and
914600	915160	um
915160	915960	behavioral genetics
915960	916600	they saw
916600	917320	how much of the genes
917320	917800	can explain
917800	918600	the proportion of intelligence
918600	919000	and
919000	920040	what they found
920040	920600	is that
920600	921800	in childhood
921800	922200	um
922200	923160	genes can explain
923160	924720	about 40% of the changes
924720	925160	but
925160	926080	in adulthood
926080	927000	genes can explain
927000	928320	up to 70%
928320	928760	and
928760	929360	we see
929360	929600	in the
929600	930360	early childhood
930360	931080	we can see
931080	931400	that
931400	931760	um
931760	932200	the genes
932200	932760	can explain
932760	933200	about
933200	934040	50% of the changes
934040	934560	and
934560	935160	in the
935160	936720	early adulthood
936720	937360	we see
937360	938600	the effect of sharing the environment
938600	939360	is less
940280	940560	yes
940560	941240	I don't know if this is
941240	942360	a surprising discovery
942360	942960	because
942960	943800	maybe someone will think
943800	944720	after we are born
944720	945320	we are constantly
945320	946480	disturbed by the environment
946480	947120	and
947120	947680	the environment
947680	949080	may have a
949080	950520	positive effect on our body
950520	950840	but
950840	951640	at least in intelligence
951640	952280	we see
952280	952560	a
952560	953880	opposite result
953880	954240	um
954240	954720	so
954720	954960	um
954960	955760	how did behavioral genetics
955760	956440	explain
956440	957680	this phenomenon
957680	958280	we think
958280	958760	it's because
958760	959480	as a person
959480	960040	develops
960040	961160	he has a better
961160	963400	control of his environment
963400	964280	so
964400	964560	yes
964560	965160	how does a person
965160	966200	decide his environment
966200	966960	most of the time
966960	967720	we will choose
967720	968280	those that meet
968280	968960	our
968960	970000	conditions
970000	970720	we feel comfortable
970720	971960	we stay there
971960	972680	so
972680	974280	it should be through this logic
974280	974480	but
974480	975160	you can imagine
975160	975960	when you were a child
975960	976560	a lot of things
976560	978280	are decided by parents
978280	978600	and
978600	979160	after growing up
979160	979720	we can
979720	980560	control more and more
980560	982040	details in our lives
982040	982480	like
982480	983160	we are not
983160	983960	after growing up
983960	984280	more and more
984280	984960	indecisive
984960	985120	but
985120	985880	we won't
985880	986920	let things we don't like
986920	987520	appear on
987520	989120	our table
989120	990680	yes
990680	991200	oh
991200	991560	what about
991560	992600	the second study
992600	994640	they looked at
994640	996280	the negative attitude of
996280	997960	teenagers' antisocial behavior and mothers
997960	999080	they studied
999080	1000560	teenagers' twins
1000560	1001720	so
1001720	1002760	teenagers' mothers
1002760	1003240	are like
1003240	1004600	an environmental factor
1007040	1007520	so
1007520	1008520	what did they find
1008520	1009480	they found
1009480	1009720	ok
1009720	1011000	the negative attitude of mothers
1011000	1011880	sounds like
1011880	1013400	a shared environmental factor
1013400	1013680	but
1013680	1014440	when they ran
1014440	1015200	that model
1015200	1016080	they found
1016080	1016760	genes
1016760	1017520	shared environment
1017520	1018720	and non-shared environment
1018720	1020040	can significantly explain
1020040	1022000	the relationship between these two concepts
1022080	1022640	so
1023040	1023800	there are a few
1023800	1024640	interesting
1024640	1024960	results
1024960	1025920	we can discuss
1025920	1026320	like
1026320	1026960	the first one
1026960	1027520	we found
1027520	1028520	individuals in the environment
1028520	1029040	are not
1029040	1030640	passively affected by the environment
1030640	1031000	but
1031000	1032640	those seem to be environmental factors
1032640	1033320	to some extent
1033320	1034040	reflect some of their
1034040	1035320	genetic characteristics
1036280	1037080	you can imagine
1037080	1039000	when interacting with people
1039000	1039840	we are not
1039840	1040920	interacting with them
1040920	1041960	in the same way
1041960	1042240	like
1042240	1043040	if you meet someone
1043040	1044280	who smiles more often today
1044280	1045320	you will
1045320	1046400	respond
1046400	1048160	smile more often
1048160	1048600	so I think
1048600	1050280	this result is quite interesting
1050280	1050680	like
1050680	1054080	some of the conditions of parents
1054080	1054760	are often thought to be
1054760	1055760	a shared environment
1055760	1056120	but
1056120	1056680	they may also be
1056680	1058120	affected by the genes of their children
1058120	1058440	so
1058440	1059080	parents may
1059080	1060600	interact with their children
1060600	1061680	in the same way
1061680	1062400	it is a bit like
1062400	1063480	the parent-to-parent relationship
1063480	1064960	shared by the high-level intelligence
1064960	1065480	maybe
1065480	1067280	the parents have too high requirements
1067280	1067440	so
1067440	1067760	I think
1067760	1068240	this result
1068240	1069840	can comfort some parents
1069840	1070360	like
1070360	1070560	oh
1070560	1071120	no
1071120	1071880	like
1071880	1072720	you may do something
1072720	1073800	and the child will not respond
1073800	1075200	or
1075200	1076200	what you do
1076200	1077200	is because the child
1077200	1078720	makes you do this
1078720	1079840	and so on
1080280	1081520	then
1081520	1084400	some environmental factors of parents
1084400	1084760	such as
1084760	1085920	this negative attitude
1085920	1086560	it can also
1086560	1088600	cause individual differences
1088600	1089960	if everyone has brothers and sisters
1089960	1090880	it may be easier to imagine
1090880	1091080	that
1091080	1091560	there will always be
1091560	1093200	when parents are biased
1093200	1093840	although
1093840	1094400	this mother
1094400	1096360	may have a negative attitude
1096360	1097880	is higher than average
1097880	1098040	but
1098040	1098880	her negative attitude
1098880	1100560	may only target a certain child
1100560	1100880	so
1100880	1102160	such a relationship
1102160	1103160	will cause
1103160	1104120	differences between individuals
1106640	1106800	yes
1106800	1107040	so
1107040	1108080	let's stop here
1108080	1110280	do you have any questions?
1110280	1110920	hello
1110920	1112040	I would like to ask
1112640	1113560	my name is Shi Qinghua
1113560	1116080	Shi Toushi
1116080	1117800	Tsinghua University
1117800	1118680	I would like to ask
1118680	1119640	about
1119640	1120800	the paper
1120800	1121440	on self-discipline
1121440	1123040	about self-discipline
1123040	1124960	their explanation is that
1124960	1125640	after adulthood
1125640	1128280	it is better to master the environment
1128280	1128960	then
1128960	1130960	such a component
1130960	1132120	if like us
1132120	1135040	international students
1135040	1135920	will there be any changes
1135920	1136840	did they discuss it?
1136840	1138080	because we are
1138080	1138600	in an environment
1138600	1139800	that we are not familiar with
1139800	1141560	and do not have a good grasp of
1142840	1143120	oh
1143120	1143840	understand
1143840	1144240	but I think
1144240	1145360	their paper on self-discipline
1145360	1147280	may be more like
1147280	1148440	the kind of self-discipline
1148440	1150920	that will not be affected by language
1150920	1152120	so
1152120	1152800	I was thinking
1152800	1153720	that
1153720	1154880	the part about international students
1154880	1155920	is that
1155920	1156600	the way of measuring
1156600	1157920	will it be more unfavorable for us
1157920	1159360	this kind of miscalculation?
1160600	1161040	not entirely
1161040	1162360	because like us
1162360	1163480	to a new environment
1163480	1163920	especially
1163920	1165520	when it is a very unfamiliar environment
1166520	1167200	many times
1167200	1168040	our performance
1168040	1169280	is actually
1169280	1170680	likely to be
1170680	1172160	worse at the beginning
1172160	1172520	of course
1172520	1173280	it is also
1173280	1174320	more in line with what they said
1174320	1175360	because we are in an environment
1175360	1176720	after getting used to
1176720	1178480	will perform better
1178480	1180280	but we
1180280	1181040	in fact, I just want to say
1181040	1181560	that we will not
1181560	1182280	because of the environment
1182280	1183080	to become a little stupid
1183080	1184120	like this
1184120	1186080	I think it will
1186080	1187120	there is a
1187120	1188480	more related
1188480	1188960	but they are
1188960	1190840	discussing the social economic status
1190840	1192040	is the parents
1192040	1192840	is the family
1192840	1193920	those social status
1193920	1194640	and so on
1194680	1195960	and then they found
1195960	1197360	that there is an interaction
1197360	1197680	that is
1197680	1198280	if you are
1198280	1199680	social economic status
1199680	1201160	family resources more
1201160	1203400	your genes can be better
1203400	1204560	but if your resources
1204560	1205280	less
1205280	1206640	most of the environment is oppressive
1206640	1207440	and then the environment
1207440	1208080	to explain
1208080	1208440	you that
1208440	1210000	the bad performance of the intelligence
1211800	1212400	yes
1212400	1212840	understand
1212840	1213600	thank you
1213600	1215000	hope to answer the question
1215000	1215600	but they do
1215600	1216880	is the social economic status
1216880	1217480	but I think
1217480	1218000	that is
1218000	1218880	discussing
1218880	1219680	that
1219680	1220880	the whole environmental change
1220880	1221960	is also quite interesting
1223760	1224480	Hi
1224480	1225520	I have a question
1226040	1226920	Hi
1226920	1227160	Hi
1227160	1227560	I am
1227560	1229320	my name is Qiao En
1229320	1230280	I want to follow
1230280	1231000	just that
1231000	1232160	the question of Tsinghua
1232160	1233680	want to ask is that
1233680	1234560	that
1234560	1235120	is because
1235120	1236920	after a long time
1236920	1237680	you see it
1237680	1238560	seems
1238560	1241600	the amount of gene explanation is rising
1241600	1242120	that
1242120	1243880	this means that
1243880	1244560	it will come to us
1244560	1245160	when we are adults
1245160	1245800	we choose
1245800	1247240	to have
1247240	1247720	should be like this
1247720	1247920	oh
1247920	1249480	I have to ask the question
1249480	1250240	should say that
1250240	1251520	how is it
1251520	1252600	the real state
1252600	1254360	is that after we are adults
1254440	1255520	see that
1255520	1256040	the performance
1256040	1257400	is in line with
1257400	1258480	the real gene explanation
1258480	1259560	or our childhood
1259560	1260440	that is
1262440	1263480	I think this question
1263480	1264200	is very interesting
1264200	1265520	I personally will be more inclined
1265520	1266120	I think
1266120	1266880	during adulthood
1266880	1267600	we really have
1267600	1268720	complete autonomy
1268720	1269440	measured things
1269440	1270320	is true
1270320	1270840	but I think it
1270840	1271840	behind the reaction is quite a lot
1271840	1273080	is that you want to see
1273080	1273880	development
1274640	1277280	is the concept of the human development process
1277280	1278160	I am more inclined
1278160	1278640	to adulthood
1278640	1279400	this result
1279760	1280400	is good
1280960	1281320	thank you
1281320	1281920	I also think so
1281920	1283080	I just want to know
1283080	1284120	what do you think
1285000	1285560	thank you
1287000	1287680	that means
1287680	1289000	there is a question here
1289000	1289960	Gao Xian, do you want to ask yourself
1289960	1291280	ask yourself
1292600	1293200	ok
1293200	1293840	I also posted it
1293840	1294920	on the chat room
1294920	1296320	I am quite curious
1296320	1296760	that
1297320	1297520	ok
1297520	1298200	I ask directly
1298200	1298800	that is
1298800	1299440	twins
1299440	1300000	they may
1300000	1301080	have different
1301080	1303120	interactions with the environment
1303120	1303920	their genes
1303920	1305040	may have some disappearance
1305040	1306000	for example, the fake plan
1306000	1306440	and so on
1306440	1307880	as a chemistry
1307880	1308360	assistant
1308360	1309520	I ask this question
1309520	1310400	if this matter
1310400	1311840	is also considered
1311840	1312760	then we
1312760	1313800	you just
1313800	1315080	mentioned in the last page
1315080	1316200	we assume
1316200	1318120	when talking about the parameter
1318120	1319000	you said
1319000	1319720	twin genes
1319720	1321200	we assume it is related to 1
1321200	1322120	but if we
1322120	1322600	consider
1322600	1323160	these
1323160	1324400	modified
1324400	1325520	issues
1325520	1325920	that obviously
1325920	1327360	should not be 1
1327360	1327960	that is
1327960	1328560	I do not know
1328560	1329240	this matter
1329240	1330440	on behavioral genetics
1330440	1331720	how to consider
1333680	1334720	I think
1335960	1336960	I think they
1336960	1337240	oh
1337240	1338440	behavioral genetics
1338440	1339960	it will explain the method
1339960	1341720	because you are in the process of the process of
1341920	1343280	gene is exactly the same
1343280	1344000	so that causes you
1344000	1345320	behind the fake plan process
1345320	1346200	will be classified as
1346200	1347280	non-shared environment
1347280	1348040	is the environment
1348040	1349800	stimulate the performance of your fake plan
1349800	1350360	like this
1351840	1353240	but indeed we can go to see
1353240	1354520	the environment and gene
1354520	1355720	some of the interaction
1357000	1357760	so that
1357760	1358920	it feels like
1358920	1359880	I do not know
1359880	1360400	in
1360400	1361480	statistics on this matter
1361480	1363440	how you will go to run this analysis
1363440	1364360	but it feels like
1364360	1366280	genes and the following
1367400	1368280	environment
1368280	1368960	these two variables
1368960	1369800	may be related to
1369800	1370440	is not it
1372240	1373400	in the model
1373400	1374880	is not related
1375720	1377080	to the assumption is not related
1377080	1377920	but in statistics
1377920	1378200	is not it
1378200	1379040	may be related
1379040	1379960	to the statistics
1379960	1380680	I do not know how you
1380680	1381200	run analysis
1381200	1382320	but I think in statistics
1382320	1383400	is not it
1383400	1384240	that is between the variables
1384240	1385840	there is a relationship
1385840	1386560	but may not have
1386560	1387360	a contributory problem
1387360	1387880	but
1387880	1389000	I understand
1389000	1390120	your assumption
1390800	1392400	I can comment on a small
1393040	1393640	good
1393640	1394400	is
1394400	1395720	epigenetics
1395720	1397280	side of the impact
1397280	1398600	in fact, a large part
1398600	1400560	is from the environment
1400560	1402560	so in fact it can
1402560	1404040	even if its epigenetic mutations
1404040	1406680	or mutations of histone modification
1406680	1407920	or other
1407920	1409280	modifications of the difference
1409280	1410920	in fact, a lot from the
1410920	1412680	impact of the environment
1412680	1414440	so in fact it should be
1414440	1415440	if I were
1415440	1416640	I would tend to put it
1416640	1419080	on the effect of the environment
1419080	1420640	like before there is a
1420640	1421080	study
1421080	1421960	it is a
1421960	1424040	identical twin
1424040	1425000	one up in space
1425000	1426280	one did not go to space
1426280	1428480	and then under the influence of neutrality
1428480	1430040	their genetics
1430040	1430840	part of the same
1430840	1431960	but epigenetic
1431960	1432680	modification
1432680	1435080	is very, very large
1435080	1436240	so it should still
1436240	1438040	count on the impact of the environment
1441240	1441840	thank you
1441840	1443960	I just tried to
1443960	1445040	express this thing
1445040	1446200	but I am actually a little
1446200	1447000	hesitant
1447000	1447560	about
1447560	1448720	if it is epigenetic
1448720	1449600	it seems to be through
1449600	1450640	the gene pathway
1450640	1451840	but conceptually we will put it
1451840	1453720	on the non-shared environment
1453720	1454880	this factor
1458480	1459240	thank you
1459240	1460000	understand
1460000	1460800	you are welcome
1460800	1461800	that
1461800	1463680	we still have other questions
1466680	1468160	that I will continue
1468160	1468720	that
1468720	1471640	will move to the next part of our laboratory
1472320	1473840	that we are called
1473840	1474320	the laboratory
1474320	1475040	PhD
1475040	1476160	Twin Project
1476160	1477560	and then my boss is PI
1477560	1478560	that we have done two
1478560	1480120	long-term tracking
1480120	1480840	first plan is to see
1480840	1482160	two to three years old
1482160	1482880	and then the second
1482880	1484200	is another set of children
1484200	1486080	and then from three years old to five years old
1486080	1487240	that my research is mainly
1487240	1488480	for the second database
1488480	1490080	is three to five years old before school
1490080	1490800	this stage
1491800	1492960	that our database
1492960	1494240	there are 310
1494240	1495760	twins of the same gender
1495760	1497720	and then a little bit less than
1497720	1498320	here
1498320	1499160	it is worth noting that
1499160	1500520	we are talking about the same gender
1500520	1501680	because the same gender twins
1501680	1502680	must be the same gender
1502680	1503520	but the same gender
1503520	1504400	may be the same gender
1504400	1505480	may be the same gender
1505480	1506600	that we want to reduce
1506600	1508120	some of the gender-caused
1508120	1508800	measurement errors
1508800	1509520	so we agreed to
1509520	1511080	receive twins of the same gender
1511760	1512360	and then
1512360	1513440	I have a little story here
1513440	1514160	on the first year
1514160	1515360	when I still have a chance to talk to the boss
1515360	1516720	face to face
1516720	1517400	I asked him
1517400	1519200	where to find so many twins
1519200	1519840	and then said
1519840	1521040	oh, we are in Boston
1521040	1522440	the progress of reproductive medicine
1522440	1524400	is suddenly a big mistake
1524400	1525080	that these twins
1525080	1526880	some of the artificial
1526880	1528080	results
1528080	1529160	and then
1529160	1530360	so our search
1530360	1532200	is to be in the twins
1532200	1533400	three years old, four years old, five years old
1533400	1534240	before and after the birthday
1534240	1535440	and then invite them to the lab
1535440	1536480	to do the experiment
1536480	1537320	that the experiment process
1537320	1539120	about three to four hours
1539120	1540800	and then we collect a lot of data
1540800	1542560	that is, including behavioral observation
1542560	1544320	to some tasks
1544320	1545400	and then or questionnaire
1545440	1546520	that questionnaire will ask
1546520	1547160	parents
1547160	1549160	that is, the main caretaker fill out
1549160	1550120	and then the test taker
1550120	1550680	will follow
1550680	1552120	the process of interacting with children
1552120	1553360	to do some evaluation
1554280	1555480	that measurement of the phenomenon
1555480	1556320	we collect
1556320	1558120	the cognitive function of the child's temperament
1558120	1559480	learning performance
1559480	1560560	cognitive function and learning performance
1560560	1563240	there will be more detailed examples
1563240	1564120	and then there are some
1564120	1565280	behavioral problems
1565280	1566800	such as internalizing problem
1566800	1568600	or externalizing problem
1568600	1569560	that it is a more
1569560	1571280	psychopathology classification
1571280	1572360	internalizing problem
1572360	1574400	is more emotional
1575360	1576000	you can imagine
1576000	1578200	those problems that are deeper in the heart
1578200	1580360	such as depression, anxiety, etc.
1580360	1581760	externalizing problem
1581760	1582880	is more on behavior
1582880	1583720	can be observed
1583720	1584240	such as
1585640	1586400	antisocial behavior
1586400	1588040	or attack behavior, etc.
1588040	1590160	so we have this kind of data
1590160	1591040	and then we also have
1591040	1591840	the process of collecting parents
1591840	1593920	interacting with children, etc.
1593920	1595960	there are more than 300 variables in a year
1595960	1596760	so my first year
1596760	1597560	is probably to understand
1597560	1598680	what is in the database
1598680	1599960	but I think I have not yet
1599960	1600680	fully understand
1600680	1602600	what kind of data
1602600	1603960	and then show you some
1603960	1604920	photos of cute children
1604920	1606520	when we collect the case
1606520	1607440	when they are tested
1607440	1608520	are separately tested
1608520	1609720	so these are taken at the same time
1609720	1612200	is the behind the scenes
1612200	1615400	experiment outside the experiment
1615400	1617240	and then the computer
1617240	1618240	is to show you
1618240	1619400	we have some tests
1619400	1621440	are carried out on the computer
1621440	1622480	and then if the child
1622480	1624160	for sitting in the laboratory
1624160	1625040	if you feel uncomfortable
1625040	1626640	we will invite their parents
1626640	1628000	is to sit in the room
1628000	1629200	but is not to interfere with
1629200	1630960	the child's task
1630960	1632320	that is quite interesting
1632320	1633480	here is the pool
1633480	1634280	it is an observation
1634280	1635880	of the child's temperament
1635880	1637520	and then there is a story
1637520	1638840	that is when I applied
1638840	1639560	my boss told me
1639560	1641400	I do not have to collect the case
1641400	1642680	is to collect
1642680	1644240	the analysis of the data
1644240	1645480	and then want to see if I can accept
1645480	1646320	because someone is
1646320	1647920	must play with their own children
1647920	1649080	and then I feel a little pity
1649080	1650560	but I am not very persistent
1650560	1651760	and then I went to the laboratory
1651760	1653520	I saw the recording screen
1653520	1654440	because we will first record
1654440	1655960	and then the coding
1655960	1657560	and then see a lot of children
1657560	1658400	once put in the pool
1658400	1659960	began to cry and scream
1659960	1660720	I originally imagined
1660720	1662320	the pool is a very happy
1662360	1662840	environment
1662840	1664120	children should be very happy
1664120	1664880	but it seems that a lot of people
1664880	1667160	is to be put into a unique space
1667160	1668520	and then they feel very afraid
1668520	1669840	so like this task
1669840	1670720	we can observe
1670720	1671960	the child's fearfulness
1671960	1673560	or activity level
1673560	1674280	like fearfulness
1674280	1675720	is to cry and scream
1675720	1676920	or not
1676920	1678600	that activity level is also very interesting
1678600	1680000	is their activity
1680000	1681280	that we see some children
1681280	1682480	is standing crying
1682480	1683440	some will only play
1683440	1684560	the ball on their feet
1684560	1685840	some will run and jump
1685840	1686600	and then fall
1686600	1687120	and then stand up
1687120	1688120	continue to run and jump
1688120	1689880	some will throw all the balls out
1689880	1691720	and then the whole laboratory
1691720	1693160	is full of their fearfulness
1693160	1694200	so you can really see
1694200	1695640	a lot of different changes
1695640	1696640	children have different reactions
1699640	1700400	so
1700400	1701280	that is
1701280	1702040	during the experiment
1702040	1704000	we will not interfere with children
1704000	1705280	how to play
1705280	1706960	so they can even cry
1706960	1708520	the experimenter can only endure
1708520	1709560	and then scream
1709560	1711280	endure that scream for three minutes
1711280	1712360	so I feel
1712360	1713160	too fortunate
1713160	1714400	do not have to play by yourself
1714400	1715080	but this child
1715080	1716240	looks pretty happy
1716240	1717520	it's great
1717520	1718480	and then in the upper right corner
1718480	1719400	this is our collection
1719400	1722000	a task of parent-child interaction
1722000	1722800	this toy is called
1722800	1723640	Etch-a-Sketch
1723640	1724320	and then I do not know
1724320	1725440	if everyone has seen it in Taiwan
1725440	1727320	I do not seem to have played
1727320	1728640	it is a board
1728640	1729920	and then there are two whirls
1729920	1731280	and then one can be controlled up and down
1731280	1732760	one can be controlled left and right
1732760	1733200	and then
1733200	1734480	we will give the children
1734480	1735920	a few pictures with the parents
1735920	1736800	and then they have to
1736800	1737600	within five minutes
1737600	1739040	the more pictures the better
1739040	1740160	that in the process
1740160	1741640	we can observe a lot of aspects
1741640	1742480	like parents
1742480	1743360	will be more authoritative
1743360	1744320	to give instructions
1744320	1745760	or more like a cooperation
1745760	1747040	in helping children
1747040	1747960	and then we can also see
1747960	1749520	some of their physical interaction
1749520	1750760	language communication
1750760	1751920	or if the child
1751920	1752520	today is not
1752520	1753520	want to do this task
1753520	1754680	parents will give what reaction
1754680	1755760	and so on
1755760	1756000	yes
1756000	1756560	and then we
1756560	1757320	the recipient is
1757320	1757720	will be like this
1757720	1759200	one by one to the lab
1759200	1760640	is very cute
1760640	1761520	do not have to collect their own people
1761520	1763800	can say this kind of sarcastic
1763800	1764440	and then
1764440	1765320	then I will share
1765320	1767360	my two analysis
1767360	1768760	that the first one
1768760	1769480	we looked at
1769480	1770920	at the age of three
1770920	1772760	the relationship between
1772760	1774040	the child's temperament and school readiness
1774040	1775160	how to be explained by
1775160	1776960	genes and the environment
1777000	1779000	that we first talk about
1779000	1780360	what is temperament
1780360	1780800	temperament
1780800	1781920	it is a child's temperament
1781920	1782840	that it can be understood
1782840	1783600	on the concept of
1783600	1785360	the basis of personality
1785360	1786560	the most widely known theory
1786560	1787080	should be
1787080	1787880	Chase and Thomas
1787880	1789560	they divide the baby into
1789560	1790240	easy baby
1790240	1791000	difficult baby
1791000	1792760	and slow to warm up
1792760	1793880	and other
1793880	1794880	and then they have
1794880	1796640	developed more detailed
1796640	1797240	classification
1797240	1797960	such as
1797960	1799480	the ability of the baby's self-adjustment
1799480	1800920	the activity of the baby
1800920	1801880	their emotional performance
1801880	1802560	is high
1802560	1803880	or relatively plain
1803880	1804880	or positive emotions
1804880	1805240	more
1805240	1806040	or negative emotions
1806040	1806440	more
1806440	1806640	like this
1807640	1808120	in addition to
1808120	1808800	Chase and Thomas
1808800	1809560	theory
1809560	1810680	there are other theories
1810680	1811080	but
1811080	1811880	behavioral genetics
1811880	1812520	the interesting thing is
1812520	1812880	found that
1812880	1814440	no matter what classification
1814440	1815040	we see
1815040	1815680	the child's temperament
1815680	1816480	has a very high
1816480	1817520	heritability
1817520	1817960	that is to say
1817960	1818320	this thing
1818320	1818760	is a bit like a
1818760	1819400	metaphor
1819400	1820160	genes can explain
1820160	1821840	a lot of
1821840	1822120	that
1822120	1823000	in this study
1823000	1823560	we use
1823560	1824920	Methody's classification
1824920	1825560	it looks at
1825560	1826200	activity
1826200	1826680	emotion
1826680	1828320	and concentration
1828320	1828720	and then
1828720	1829240	in
1829240	1830560	school readiness
1830560	1831480	its concept
1831480	1831760	is
1831760	1832360	children
1832360	1833000	how well prepared for
1833000	1834520	going to school
1834520	1835040	so it's actually
1835040	1836080	a pretty broad concept
1836080	1836320	like
1836320	1837160	children's
1837160	1838040	physical development
1838040	1838280	because
1838280	1839200	like some kindergartens
1839200	1839760	they ask
1839760	1840640	children to walk
1840640	1841440	or eat by themselves
1841440	1842480	to go
1842480	1842680	then
1842680	1843040	or
1843040	1844360	children's emotional control
1844360	1845160	this kind of
1845160	1846280	development of ability
1846280	1846640	that
1846640	1847440	our study
1847440	1847960	focus
1847960	1848400	is more like
1848400	1849440	academic performance
1849440	1849640	then
1849640	1849920	we use
1849920	1850640	Bracken
1850640	1851800	this measurement method
1851800	1852360	includes
1852360	1852960	them for
1852960	1853640	shape
1853640	1854240	number
1854240	1855640	English alphabets
1855640	1856320	color
1856320	1857000	size
1857000	1857240	this
1857240	1857840	in kindergarten
1857840	1858440	knowledge
1858440	1859640	will be used in the environment
1859640	1860600	look at their
1860600	1861360	in such a test
1861360	1862960	how high the score can be
1862960	1863800	such
1863800	1864280	good
1864600	1865600	Why do we want to
1865600	1866520	put these two concepts
1866520	1867720	connected together
1867720	1868240	mainly because
1868240	1869360	past research
1869360	1870000	they found
1870000	1871520	children's temperament when they were one year old
1871520	1872400	can be predicted
1872400	1873280	three or five years later
1873280	1874320	school readiness
1874320	1874560	so
1874560	1875560	represent these two concepts
1875560	1877280	there is some kind of relationship
1877280	1877640	but
1877640	1878600	this is not a
1878600	1879840	behavioral genetics research
1879840	1880240	so
1880240	1881000	what exactly is
1881000	1881840	what
1881840	1882280	in
1882280	1882800	control
1882800	1882960	is
1882960	1883240	genes
1883240	1883800	or the environment
1883800	1884120	control
1884120	1885880	the relationship between these two concepts
1885880	1887440	we are not very clear
1887440	1888480	behavioral genetics
1888480	1889000	we
1889000	1890160	less research in this area
1890160	1890400	then
1890400	1891040	I found a
1891040	1891720	closest
1891720	1892200	is
1892200	1892800	they look at
1892800	1893480	concentration
1893480	1894800	and academic performance
1894800	1895040	in
1895040	1896600	three or four years old
1896600	1897200	and then they found
1897200	1897720	mainly
1897720	1898600	by genes
1898600	1900040	to explain
1900040	1900520	so
1900520	1900880	this
1900880	1901520	analysis of
1901520	1901960	novelty
1901960	1902680	is that we want to
1902680	1903320	consider at the same time
1903320	1903720	different
1903720	1904400	child temperament
1904400	1905360	and then see if
1905360	1906280	this child temperament
1906280	1906800	they
1906800	1907640	with school readiness
1907640	1908200	have
1908200	1908960	the same genes
1908960	1909640	in control
1909640	1910360	or say
1910360	1910880	is only
1910880	1911480	concentration
1911480	1912040	especially this
1912040	1913160	child temperament
1913160	1913560	is with
1913560	1914200	school readiness
1914200	1915080	related
1915080	1915800	because everyone can imagine
1915800	1916920	in the educational scene
1916920	1917800	in the field
1917800	1918560	does not seem to be
1918560	1919240	you very focused
1919240	1919760	sitting there
1919760	1921200	you can learn a lot
1921200	1921640	but
1921640	1922000	your
1922000	1923040	emotional connection
1923040	1923640	to some
1923640	1925040	other social cognitive functions
1925040	1926080	may be affected
1926080	1926600	or your
1926600	1927240	intellectual development
1927240	1928000	if today's children
1928000	1928680	are surrounded together
1928680	1929440	run around
1929440	1930160	some things
1930160	1930680	and then they can
1930680	1932080	learn from the process
1932080	1932880	but you just
1932880	1933400	sit there
1933400	1934320	very focused
1934320	1934560	so
1934560	1935160	it seems
1935160	1936040	to learn from you
1936040	1936920	is not necessarily
1936920	1938200	a very stable
1938200	1938960	truth
1938960	1939360	development
1939360	1939680	so
1940280	1940840	good
1940840	1941360	that
1941360	1942200	before we put
1942200	1942600	the data
1942600	1944000	into the model
1944000	1944280	just like
1944280	1945200	just to talk about
1945200	1946000	our analysis
1946000	1946320	is
1946320	1948040	the relationship between twins
1948040	1949000	so we have to make sure
1949000	1950240	the relationship is established
1950240	1950800	and
1950800	1951280	on the one hand
1951280	1952000	is that we are discussing
1952000	1953000	individual differences
1953000	1953880	we have to make sure
1953880	1954680	there are enough
1954680	1955680	individual differences
1955680	1956240	we go to
1956240	1956760	analyze that
1956760	1957520	these individual differences
1957520	1958400	because of the environment
1958400	1959040	or genes
1959040	1959640	more meaningful
1960640	1960920	that
1960920	1961560	picture
1961560	1962280	you can see
1962280	1962880	purple is
1962880	1963800	same-sex twins
1963800	1964800	and pink is
1964800	1965960	same-sex twins
1965960	1966680	that
1966680	1967360	the picture on the left
1967360	1968040	is talking about
1968040	1969160	in each phenomenon
1969160	1970640	the relationship between twins
1970640	1971960	that is to say
1971960	1973520	in the emotional aspect
1973520	1974520	same-sex twins
1974520	1975280	their correlation
1975280	1975840	and same-sex twins
1975840	1977040	their correlation
1977040	1977400	and
1977400	1978040	task orientation
1978040	1979200	refers to focus
1979200	1979520	and
1979520	1980120	score readiness
1980120	1980400	that
1980400	1981200	score readiness
1982080	1982360	that
1982360	1983000	picture on the right
1983000	1983960	may be more interesting
1983960	1984240	it
1984240	1985160	we call it
1985160	1985640	cross-chain
1985640	1987080	cross-chain correlation
1987080	1987880	it refers to
1987880	1988280	we use
1988280	1988840	twins
1988840	1990160	one of the A-phenomenon
1990160	1990920	to correlate
1990920	1991880	another twin
1991880	1992760	B-phenomenon
1992760	1993440	then we go
1993440	1993920	is to run
1993920	1995200	related analysis
1995200	1995840	that
1995840	1996200	flesh and blood
1996200	1997200	we can see
1997200	1998000	same-sex twins
1998000	1998560	compared to
1998560	1999280	same-sex twins
1999280	2000120	have a higher
2000120	2000960	correlation
2000960	2001200	so
2001200	2001720	this can
2001720	2003160	tell us very roughly
2003160	2003640	genes
2003640	2004160	in explaining
2004160	2005080	these two concepts
2005080	2006360	is a certain degree of
2006360	2006800	impact
2007880	2008080	that
2008080	2008800	how much is specific
2008800	2009480	we have to
2009680	2010120	run a
2010120	2010480	model
2010480	2011160	to know
2011720	2012080	then
2012720	2013080	this
2013400	2013720	then
2013720	2013960	we
2013960	2014280	fit
2014280	2014640	is a
2014640	2015400	biometric
2015400	2016600	cholesky model
2016600	2016840	then
2016840	2017200	it is
2017200	2017720	the general
2017720	2018200	cholesky
2018200	2018600	model
2018600	2019320	inside the factor
2019320	2019600	in
2019600	2020200	further
2020200	2020880	cut into
2020880	2021640	genes
2021640	2022400	shared environment
2022400	2022680	and
2022680	2023920	non-shared environment
2023920	2024360	then
2024360	2025240	it's a bit messy
2025240	2025560	so I
2025560	2026000	step by step
2026000	2026600	to look at
2026600	2027160	this model

2030400	2031000	then
2031000	2031440	we use
2031440	2031840	genes
2031840	2032000	to

2035880	2036120	there is a

2149560	2150120	behind
2150120	2150520	the phenomenon
2150520	2151000	is a

2154960	2155160	this

2155960	2156120	is

2161800	2162160	this
2162160	2162400	this
2162400	2162720	found
2162720	2162960	we
2162960	2163240	are not
2163240	2163480	very
2163480	2163920	elegant
2163920	2164120	because
2164120	2164440	we
2164440	2164720	past
2164720	2164840	years
2164840	2165200	is that
2165200	2165560	know
2165880	2166120	task

2166600	2166760	and
2166760	2167200	affect
2167200	2167360	is
2167360	2167800	the concept of
2167800	2168520	children's temperament
2168520	2168760	is
2168760	2169160	a very
2169160	2169640	strong
2169640	2169960	gene
2169960	2170200	can
2170200	2170520	explain
2170520	2170840	them
2171280	2171400	but
2171400	2171600	we
2171600	2172080	found
2172080	2172680	interesting
2172680	2172800	is
2172800	2173000	in
2173000	2173240	school
2173240	2173720	readiness
2173720	2174160	above
2174680	2175040	affect
2175040	2175320	its
2175320	2175760	gene
2175760	2176560	is completely
2176560	2176840	with
2178080	2178600	concentration
2178600	2178840	and
2178840	2179320	emotion
2179480	2179760	these
2179760	2180440	children's temperament
2180680	2181240	the same
2181240	2181600	these
2181600	2182000	genes
2182000	2182160	it
2182160	2182560	is not
2182560	2183040	independent
2183040	2183120	of
2183120	2183800	children's temperament
2183800	2184320	other
2184320	2184720	genes
2185000	2185320	affect
2185320	2185680	it
2187000	2188160	on the other hand
2188360	2188640	in
2188640	2189200	the shared
2189200	2189720	environment
2189880	2190560	we see
2190560	2190880	the shared
2190880	2191280	environment
2191280	2191920	can not
2191920	2192400	affect
2192840	2193160	children's
2193160	2193720	temperament
2193720	2194360	that is to say
2194360	2195120	you rely on the environment
2195120	2195680	want to change
2195680	2196160	children's
2196160	2196480	little
2196480	2196840	personality
2196840	2197120	is
2197120	2197680	no way
2197680	2198040	that
2198040	2198520	you want them
2198520	2199160	to be the same
2199160	2199440	is very
2199440	2200000	difficult
2200240	2200600	if you
2200600	2200800	today
2200800	2201240	to make children
2201240	2201880	very focused
2202080	2202480	that
2202480	2202840	is
2202840	2203120	quite
2203120	2203640	difficult
2203920	2204360	but
2204360	2204880	we can
2204880	2205280	through
2205280	2205840	family
2206480	2207360	some factors
2207360	2207720	like
2208000	2208560	parents
2208560	2209080	may read
2209080	2209440	stories
2209440	2210080	to children
2210080	2210520	listen
2210520	2210720	or
2210720	2210920	they
2210920	2211320	look
2211320	2211600	look
2211600	2212120	TV
2212120	2212360	may
2212360	2212600	look
2212600	2213240	Tienxianbaobao
2213240	2213760	then learn
2213760	2214080	some
2214240	2214640	color
2214640	2214960	and
2214960	2215400	numbers
2215400	2216080	such as the concept
2216560	2217000	of these
2217320	2218280	environmental
2218280	2218760	impact can
2219080	2219720	let children's
2219720	2220440	school readiness
2220440	2222000	to move in the same direction
2222000	2222640	may be able to
2222640	2223400	improve their
2223400	2224040	school readiness
2224040	2224560	ability
2225000	2225280	and
2225400	2226120	this factor can
2226120	2226600	explain the
2226600	2227600	variation is probably
2227600	2229320	about 40%
2229840	2230880	I want to square it
2230960	2231920	about
2232840	2233200	the rest of the
2233200	2234000	good part
2234000	2234320	is that
2234320	2235120	can be shared
2235120	2235560	environment
2235560	2236400	so
2236480	2236760	that is
2236760	2237320	including some of
2237320	2237520	us
2237520	2238280	do not want to face
2238280	2238640	the measurement
2238640	2239080	error
2239240	2240040	or say
2240200	2240960	this may be
2240960	2241400	because
2241760	2242320	the same
2242320	2242840	rater
2242840	2243840	in the evaluation
2243840	2244280	of children's
2244280	2245000	children's temperament
2245000	2245680	so we see
2245680	2246560	non-shared environment
2246560	2247560	can explain
2247560	2248080	the two
2248080	2249640	covariance between the two
2251400	2251680	good
2252680	2253080	and then
2253080	2253800	summarize
2254000	2254760	so this analysis
2254760	2255360	tells us
2255360	2255800	we are in
2255800	2256520	three years old
2256520	2257160	to see
2257280	2257960	child temperament
2257960	2258920	with school readiness
2258920	2259720	between the relevant
2259880	2260400	are because
2260400	2261600	the same gene
2261840	2263080	behind the child
2263080	2263560	temperament
2263560	2264120	in the emotion
2264120	2264760	this aspect
2264760	2265480	is independent
2265480	2266000	focus
2266000	2266560	this aspect
2266560	2266920	of the gene
2267200	2268400	and the shared environment
2268680	2269360	is only
2269360	2269920	in
2269920	2270560	school readiness
2270560	2270840	above
2270840	2271480	there is a significant
2271720	2272160	impact
2272320	2272840	so
2273480	2274040	that we have to
2274040	2274600	this analysis
2274600	2275040	there is no
2275040	2275320	what
2275320	2276440	you want to ask
2284800	2285800	the question
2285800	2286240	of the host
2286240	2286640	think
2287000	2287240	OK
2287240	2288240	very clear
2288240	2288880	thank you
2290040	2290320	good
2290320	2291000	that I will
2291000	2291920	move to
2291920	2292760	the second analysis
2292760	2293240	so
2293520	2293800	that
2294160	2295120	just a little bit about
2295120	2295880	academic performance
2295880	2296720	and cognitive functions
2296720	2297520	are not the same
2297680	2298080	so
2298080	2299000	now this story
2299000	2299480	will be more
2299480	2299840	around
2299840	2301200	the development of cognitive functions
2301320	2302000	that we look at
2302000	2302800	is three to five years old
2302800	2303600	impulse control
2304560	2304800	so
2304800	2305360	impulse control
2305360	2305880	is
2305880	2307120	one of the cognitive functions
2307120	2307360	so
2307640	2308440	there is a background
2308440	2308880	introduction
2309320	2309920	impulse control
2309920	2310680	he is talking about
2310680	2311400	to adjust
2311400	2311920	impulse
2311920	2312200	with
2312200	2312800	inhibits
2312800	2313120	is also
2313120	2313720	to suppress
2313720	2314360	with the goal
2314360	2315080	unrelated
2315080	2315840	interference ability
2316160	2317640	that in early childhood
2317920	2318240	genes
2318240	2318760	and the environment
2318760	2319520	is how to explain
2319520	2320400	impulse control
2320400	2320920	we currently
2320920	2321760	find the result
2321760	2322040	a bit
2322040	2322600	diverse
2323040	2323520	such as
2323520	2324280	our lab
2324280	2324720	before
2324720	2325120	for
2325400	2326080	two or three years old
2326080	2326880	child information
2327080	2327480	with
2327480	2327920	UW
2327920	2328400	medicine
2328400	2328800	there
2328800	2329560	biopsy research
2329800	2330640	have found
2330640	2331280	the same
2331760	2332280	result
2332280	2332520	is
2332520	2333200	quite strange
2333400	2334200	when we use
2334200	2334600	parents
2334600	2335080	to assess
2335080	2335720	impulse control
2335720	2336760	to analyze
2336960	2337280	in
2337280	2337680	two years old
2337680	2338280	and three years old
2338280	2339120	we all see
2339760	2340240	inhibits
2340240	2340640	control
2340640	2341320	can be
2341320	2342360	explained by genes
2343160	2343440	but
2343440	2344000	when we use
2344000	2344960	behavioral observation
2344960	2345360	is
2345360	2345680	there is a
2345680	2345840	called
2345840	2346080	lab
2346080	2346400	tap
2346400	2347520	this way
2347680	2348760	we only see
2348760	2349160	genes
2349160	2349760	can explain
2349760	2350920	impulse control at two years old
2350920	2351760	he has no way to explain
2351760	2353000	impulse control at three years old
2353800	2354080	yes
2354200	2354440	that
2354440	2355160	more strange
2355160	2355680	is to say
2357200	2357400	in
2357400	2357840	nine years old
2357840	2358600	child
2358600	2359240	when we use
2359240	2359920	another method
2359920	2360600	is cognitive
2360600	2361040	phase
2361040	2361720	may be through some
2361720	2362080	cognitive
2362080	2362440	test
2362440	2363320	cognitive task
2363320	2364080	or computerized
2364080	2364440	test
2364640	2365240	to measure
2365240	2365520	their
2365520	2365960	inhibits
2365960	2366360	control
2366560	2367120	we found
2367240	2368120	it can be
2368120	2369160	explained by genes
2369360	2369680	so
2370400	2371520	this makes us feel
2371640	2372000	with
2372000	2372600	behavioral
2372960	2373960	observation
2373960	2374480	see
2374480	2375040	no genes
2375040	2375640	can explain
2375640	2376520	impulse control at three years old
2376520	2377200	a bit strange
2377200	2377520	because
2377760	2378360	although
2378360	2378880	development
2379040	2379440	is a
2379440	2380400	dynamic process
2380400	2381200	but you can not imagine
2381200	2381520	genes
2381520	2382400	will be open
2382400	2382760	so he
2382760	2383240	in the end is
2383480	2384000	can explain
2384000	2384800	or can not explain
2385120	2385800	that our
2385800	2386320	idea
2386320	2386800	may be
2386800	2387400	our idea
2387400	2387840	is to say
2388160	2388760	may be
2388760	2389320	behavior
2389320	2390000	observation
2390000	2390320	a bit
2390480	2390960	a bit
2390960	2391520	limited
2391520	2392000	like
2392480	2393520	our
2393760	2394560	test process
2394560	2395080	is to measure
2395080	2395640	children's
2395640	2396000	delay
2396000	2396840	gratification
2397160	2397760	that
2397760	2398080	task
2398080	2398760	like we
2398760	2399440	give children
2399880	2400160	to see
2400160	2400600	chocolate
2400600	2401400	but they have to wait
2401400	2401680	a certain
2401680	2402160	second
2402160	2402600	can eat
2402600	2403080	chocolate
2403280	2403600	so
2403720	2403920	yes
2403920	2404600	in the process of
2404600	2404680	experiment
2404680	2405040	we will feed
2405040	2405280	children
2405280	2405400	eat
2405400	2405880	chocolate
2406120	2406320	that
2406480	2407120	this ability
2407120	2407480	may be
2407480	2408120	at three years old
2408120	2408480	children
2408480	2408920	have
2408920	2409880	learned all
2410040	2410320	that
2410440	2410800	is
2410800	2411200	this is a
2411200	2411880	socialized
2411880	2412360	process
2412360	2412600	so
2412600	2413120	the environment
2413120	2413760	suppressed
2413760	2414120	their
2414120	2414560	inhibits
2414560	2415000	control
2415440	2415840	and then
2415840	2416280	put them
2416280	2416840	all
2417120	2417600	described
2417600	2418480	in the same way
2418760	2418960	that
2418960	2419400	this
2419600	2420160	environment
2420400	2420760	force
2420760	2421160	will let
2421160	2421520	genes
2421520	2421960	no place
2421960	2422520	to show
2423360	2423680	so we
2423680	2424080	want to say
2424080	2424200	oh
2424200	2424400	that
2424400	2424720	or we
2424720	2425160	use another
2425160	2425520	way
2425520	2425760	to measure
2425760	2426160	children's
2426160	2426480	impulse
2426480	2426880	control
2426880	2427200	good
2427760	2428200	so
2428320	2428800	in this
2428800	2429200	analysis
2429200	2429400	inside
2429400	2429920	we use
2429920	2430120	is
2430120	2430520	Flanker
2430520	2430920	task
2430920	2431120	then
2431120	2431440	it is
2431440	2431640	from
2431640	2432000	NIH
2432000	2432440	toolbox
2432440	2432720	inside
2432720	2433040	a
2433040	2433360	test
2433720	2433920	that
2433920	2434080	everyone
2434080	2434680	may have done
2434680	2435240	the adult version
2435240	2435320	of
2435320	2435680	Flanker
2435680	2436000	task
2436160	2436520	it is
2436520	2436920	there will be
2437200	2437600	different
2437600	2438000	arrows
2438000	2438280	pointing
2438280	2438560	different
2438560	2438960	ways
2439400	2439680	different
2439680	2440040	directions
2440320	2440560	and then
2440560	2440760	you have to
2440760	2441160	observe
2441160	2441960	the arrow in the middle
2442360	2442560	that
2442560	2443080	arrow in the middle
2443080	2443320	sometimes
2443320	2443600	will be with
2443600	2444240	the direction
2444240	2445520	of the opposite
2445520	2446040	that you can not
2446040	2446880	be next to the arrow
2446880	2447400	confused
2447400	2447880	like this
2448520	2448800	good
2448800	2449200	it is a
2449200	2449680	quite classic
2449680	2450080	measure
2450080	2450720	executive
2450720	2451200	function
2451200	2451920	task
2452280	2452680	that
2452680	2453040	for
2453040	2453560	children's
2453560	2453840	task
2453840	2454240	child's
2454240	2454800	experiment
2454800	2455040	we
2455040	2455360	in order to
2455360	2456160	let them focus
2456160	2456520	we will
2456520	2457200	the story
2457200	2457560	package
2457560	2458360	a little fun
2458360	2458760	then we
2458760	2459120	package
2459120	2459640	the story is
2459880	2460160	that we
2460160	2461160	today to feed the fish
2461160	2461600	so you have to
2461600	2461840	look at
2461840	2462360	the middle
2462360	2462960	of this fish
2462960	2463200	it is
2463200	2463600	facing
2463600	2463960	this
2463960	2464200	or
2464200	2464640	this
2465120	2465320	that
2465320	2465720	because they
2465720	2466000	answer
2466000	2466240	the way
2466240	2466440	is to
2466440	2466640	point
2466640	2466960	screen
2466960	2467280	is good
2467280	2467720	so even
2467720	2468240	the main part
2468240	2468680	can still
2468680	2469000	carry out
2469000	2469680	this experiment
2471240	2471760	and then
2471760	2471960	we
2471960	2472680	also look at
2472680	2473360	related
2473480	2473880	that everyone
2473880	2474240	may be
2474240	2474800	notice
2475040	2475720	this analysis
2475720	2476200	related
2476200	2476800	with the previous
2476800	2477160	analysis
2477160	2477520	relative
2477520	2477960	is
2477960	2478360	compared to
2478520	2479360	a lot of difference
2479720	2480000	but
2480000	2480520	they are still
2480520	2481040	obvious
2481040	2481840	so we can still
2481840	2482920	follow-up analysis
2484000	2484240	and then
2484240	2484720	another point
2484720	2485200	want to add
2485200	2485560	is that we
2485560	2485960	look here
2485960	2486120	is the
2486120	2486920	cross-age
2486920	2487600	relationship
2487920	2488240	is
2488520	2489160	every age
2489640	2490360	related
2490360	2490560	with
2490560	2491160	cross-age
2491160	2491880	related
2492200	2492400	that
2492400	2492960	we use
2492960	2493200	is
2493200	2493440	rank
2493440	2493880	order
2493880	2494600	that ability
2495080	2495360	multiply
2495360	2495720	multiply
2495720	2496040	is
2496040	2496760	PR value
2496760	2497320	so if
2497320	2498000	three years old
2498000	2498440	child's
2498440	2498880	PR value
2498880	2499480	is 95
2499760	2500160	four years old
2500160	2500760	is 95
2500960	2501120	that
2501120	2501440	the relationship
2501440	2502120	will be very high
2502360	2502680	and not
2502680	2503520	use the original result
2503520	2503840	because
2504160	2504640	in theory
2504640	2505080	this time
2505080	2505720	their cognitive
2505720	2505960	function
2505960	2506560	should develop
2506560	2507120	quickly
2507120	2507480	so you
2507480	2507960	three or four years old
2507960	2508800	get the same score
2508800	2509240	is not a
2509240	2509560	very good
2509560	2509880	phenomenon
2511080	2511240	that
2511440	2512120	here is not very
2512120	2512360	high
2512360	2512760	related
2512760	2513720	to tell us that
2513920	2514920	in this period of time
2514920	2515240	they
2515240	2515960	impulse control
2515960	2516680	ability to develop
2516680	2517520	in fact, there are many
2517520	2518200	changes
2518440	2518960	that may be
2518960	2519400	at any time
2519400	2520120	children suddenly
2520120	2520880	become black horse
2520880	2521400	and then become
2521400	2522200	super focused
2522200	2522640	and super
2522640	2522920	can
2522920	2523600	self-control
2523600	2523920	like this
2525920	2526280	and then
2526280	2527040	we put the same
2527040	2527440	data
2527440	2527840	fit to
2527840	2528240	model
2528640	2528920	although
2528920	2529440	here is also
2529440	2529880	fit a
2529880	2530360	Cholesky
2530360	2530720	model
2530720	2531120	but
2531120	2531880	behavioral genetics
2531880	2532120	or
2532120	2532840	twin research
2532840	2533360	is not only
2533360	2533920	this model
2533920	2534360	can be used
2534360	2535040	this is more like
2535040	2536000	the process of my practice
2536200	2536480	but
2536480	2537160	you can see
2537160	2537880	that this model
2537880	2538280	is actually in
2538280	2539120	the development of research
2539120	2539720	is quite
2539720	2541280	a good model
2541280	2541800	because
2541800	2542240	like
2542240	2543040	in the previous example
2543040	2543720	it tells us
2543720	2545000	how many factors
2545000	2546400	between different concepts
2546400	2547000	can be
2547320	2547960	how many factors
2547960	2548600	are overlapped
2548840	2549080	that
2549080	2549560	here, then
2549560	2550320	it can tell us
2550320	2550680	in
2550680	2552280	different periods of development
2552640	2552960	those
2552960	2553880	stable
2553880	2554320	with new
2554320	2555600	added factors
2555600	2555920	is
2555920	2556560	stability
2556560	2557200	and change
2557840	2558520	can be how
2558520	2559200	explained
2559200	2559880	is how to be
2559880	2561080	explained by genes and the environment
2561520	2561800	that
2561800	2562120	our
2562120	2562400	best
2562400	2563200	fitting model
2563200	2563760	tells us
2563760	2564040	the first
2564040	2564480	most important
2564480	2564720	is
2564960	2565960	the shared environment
2565960	2567120	does not show the impact
2567280	2567640	but
2567640	2568200	most of them
2568200	2568440	are
2568440	2568800	genes
2569360	2570280	are explained by genes and
2570280	2571720	non-shared environment
2571720	2571960	that
2572360	2573880	age to age
2573880	2574920	stability
2574920	2575200	is that
2575200	2575720	these will
2575720	2576440	cross
2576440	2577240	different age
2577240	2577600	paths
2577920	2578440	are
2578760	2579760	the effect of genes
2580320	2580680	so
2581880	2582640	why do we see
2582640	2584000	stable development between ages
2584000	2584960	are all because of genes
2584960	2586000	is explained by genes
2586360	2586600	that
2586800	2587080	but
2587080	2588000	those changes
2588000	2589040	across ages
2589040	2589520	is
2589840	2590640	genes and
2590640	2591560	non-shared environment
2591560	2591920	together
2591920	2592840	to create
2593640	2594080	the effect
2594080	2594600	like this
2595520	2595800	good
2596320	2596680	so
2597280	2598600	you may be curious
2598600	2598880	that
2599360	2600800	these new genes
2600800	2601760	represent what
2601760	2602600	this may mean
2602600	2603080	we are
2603400	2604320	in the process of development
2604320	2604560	like
2604760	2605160	just
2606360	2606560	right
2606560	2606800	no
2606800	2607120	good
2607120	2607320	this
2607320	2607920	we can see
2607920	2608520	the brain
2608520	2609320	or other
2609320	2610160	physiological development
2610160	2610320	that
2610320	2610840	this is
2610840	2612120	the place where DNA can perform
2613400	2613720	then
2613880	2614400	I put this
2614400	2614840	model
2614840	2616040	change a way to perform
2616040	2616720	is to put those
2616720	2617880	factors
2617880	2618440	into
2619640	2620240	the model
2620440	2620680	and then
2620680	2621600	here want to see is
2621720	2622800	in every age
2623160	2623600	between
2623800	2624760	in every age
2624760	2625400	we see the
2625400	2625960	variance
2626200	2627320	how much can be
2627320	2629760	explained by genes or non-shared environment
2630960	2631120	that
2631600	2632400	we can pay attention to is
2632520	2633240	every age
2633520	2633840	of
2634240	2635320	mutations are different
2635320	2635520	and then
2635520	2636480	we draw here is the percentage
2636600	2637440	so interesting is
2637440	2638880	although mutations themselves are different
2639120	2640680	but genes can explain the proportion
2640680	2641880	is quite stable
2641880	2642080	that
2642240	2643320	is 35%
2643320	2644200	36%
2644400	2644640	that
2644760	2645640	this is the proportion
2645640	2646560	we just mentioned
2646560	2647320	heritability
2647320	2648400	is genes can explain
2648520	2649680	what percentage of mutations
2649680	2649880	that
2650640	2652240	if we look more carefully
2652600	2653480	we can see
2653760	2655360	at the age of four
2655560	2656080	most of the
2656080	2656800	heritability
2656800	2658400	is explained by the genes
2658400	2659760	of the new performance at the age of four
2659760	2661360	about 80% of these
2661360	2662280	heritability
2662800	2664400	but at the age of five
2664600	2665680	the new genes
2665680	2666520	only show
2666520	2667520	50% of the
2667520	2668280	heritability
2668280	2669200	and the rest is
2669400	2670680	in the previous age
2670800	2672720	the effect of those genes that have been left behind
2674000	2674480	so this
2674880	2675640	result tells us
2675640	2676200	is the longest
2676200	2676840	highest number of
2676840	2677080	people
2677080	2677880	still worth it
2677880	2678920	it can tell us some
2678920	2680000	more interesting
2680000	2681320	genes
2681320	2682520	in the process of development
2682520	2683600	is how to change
2683600	2684120	this
2684440	2684800	good
2684920	2685320	that
2685320	2685840	the same
2685840	2687080	small summary
2687240	2688320	so we see
2688320	2689000	three to five years old
2689000	2690480	the stability of the age range
2690480	2692360	is all explained by the genes
2692520	2694000	but the change in the age range
2694000	2697080	is explained by the genes and non-shared environment
2697080	2697600	and
2697600	2698480	the shared environment
2698480	2699240	no way
2699280	2700240	to impulse control
2700240	2701520	has a significant impact
2702400	2703000	and I remember
2703000	2703840	I last summer
2703840	2704760	with my university teacher
2704760	2705360	Mr. Wu Wen-Chi
2705360	2706200	share this result
2706200	2706880	is that he is a pair of
2706880	2707520	dragon and phoenix
2707520	2708040	and then at that time
2708040	2708560	four or five years old
2708800	2709320	and I said
2709320	2710120	surprised
2710120	2711800	parents can not use the same way
2711800	2713560	to improve the ability of children to impulse control
2713920	2714480	and then he
2714480	2715200	laughed for a moment
2715480	2716200	do not need to do the experiment
2716200	2717000	I knew
2717000	2717640	because the children
2717640	2718680	do not care what you are doing
2718920	2719440	and I feel
2719880	2721720	so strong sense of helplessness and helplessness
2721720	2723320	is really quite hard parents
2724680	2725040	OK
2725600	2726480	here to stop
2726480	2727200	good for
2727200	2728080	these two analysis
2728080	2728600	have what
2728600	2729600	you want to ask the question
2733720	2734920	I want to ask
2734920	2735640	is
2737840	2738480	Although
2738480	2739560	because the environment
2739560	2740800	between the twins
2740800	2741720	is the same
2741720	2742400	but
2742400	2744240	every pair of twins
2744920	2745920	is the difference between
2745920	2747040	their social
2747040	2747640	economic
2747640	2748040	rank
2748440	2750120	will not affect them
2753040	2753760	I think
2753760	2755320	social economic status
2755440	2757000	so that is the family
2757760	2758600	family shared
2758600	2760000	those environmental factors
2760000	2760480	is it
2760720	2761760	right
2761880	2762320	because
2762320	2763720	it will be calculated to
2763720	2764760	the shared environment
2764760	2766160	you say in the impulse control
2766200	2767680	will not affect the shared environment
2768520	2769840	because I found that
2769840	2770360	there is no
2771360	2772800	I'm just curious to say
2773040	2774160	in fact, not in this
2774160	2775120	this comparison
2775360	2776120	but to say
2777000	2778360	in your observation
2779000	2780320	different pairs of twins
2780600	2781520	social economic
2781760	2783040	situation
2783040	2783960	will affect
2784360	2785680	their child's
2786320	2787280	impulse control
2789880	2791400	I do not seem to
2791560	2793120	particularly in this direction
2793120	2794520	development
2795200	2795720	discovery
2796240	2796840	Yeah
2800160	2800920	I think
2800920	2802320	in the impulsive control
2802320	2803400	or child development
2803400	2804920	in most cases, they will focus on
2805160	2807000	the education of the mother
2807080	2808280	is a lot of information
2808640	2808780	it is now
2808780	2809680	on this
2809760	2810040	but
2810040	2810560	is most of the mother
2810560	2810880	education
2810880	2811320	will be called
2811320	2811440	social
2811440	2812720	economic status
2812880	2813760	parel
2813760	2814240	but that
2814240	2814880	is not
2814920	2818440	the idea of ​​the whole big
2818440	2819360	SES generalization
2822920	2823440	there is
2823560	2823840	a
2824400	2824880	sort
2825240	2825680	have
2825800	2826040	it
2826040	2826760	I want to add just
2826760	2827160	Tsinghua
2827600	2828240	Tsinghua teacher
2828480	2829280	of the problem
2829600	2830000	so in fact
2830000	2830560	because you just
2830560	2831320	in fact, have mentioned that
2831320	2832040	you Boston
2832040	2832440	this
2832440	2833240	this study
2833600	2834560	is most of
2834600	2835960	the medical center of
2836120	2836840	medical promotion so I can imagine
2836840	2837640	in fact, your whole
2838200	2838720	I do not know
2838720	2839560	is not the fact
2839840	2840680	but I feel
2840680	2841720	your whole sample size
2841720	2842720	sample should be
2842720	2843040	very
2843360	2844160	very biased
2844160	2844440	is
2844840	2845240	I say so
2845240	2845560	is not
2845680	2846880	not to criticize your
2847280	2847680	sample
2847680	2848280	I mean
2848280	2848760	so it sounds like
2848760	2849600	your sample should
2851560	2851760	not
2851760	2852320	I just say
2852320	2852880	I like to hear
2852880	2853440	your sample
2853440	2853840	is more
2853840	2854680	higher
2854960	2855800	knowledge level
2855800	2856560	or high
2856840	2857560	economic level
2857720	2858040	and then
2858040	2858840	is just mentioned
2858840	2859400	you talk about that
2859400	2860000	educational level
2860280	2861000	in fact, I think
2861560	2861960	this thing
2861960	2862560	I think it is very interesting
2862560	2862840	because
2862920	2863400	I do not know
2863400	2863840	you know
2863840	2864160	that is
2864160	2865520	they have to discuss
2865800	2866440	all of the
2866440	2867240	social economy
2867240	2867960	of these
2867960	2868520	social economic
2869120	2871040	background
2871040	2872680	these social economic
2872920	2874080	it is actually a
2874080	2874680	cluster
2874960	2875720	that this cluster
2875720	2876160	inside
2876360	2876640	like
2876760	2877000	it
2877400	2878200	he thought
2878480	2879000	that is
2879000	2879920	formal education
2879920	2880960	is inside the host
2881280	2881600	that is
2881600	2882200	this change
2882200	2882600	it is actually
2882600	2883960	all of the control of that
2884280	2885160	your social and economic
2885360	2885640	for example, say
2885640	2886440	your education level
2886440	2886960	higher
2887160	2887680	your
2887680	2888440	whole economic level
2888440	2889120	you will be higher
2889120	2889680	usually
2889680	2890000	that is
2890000	2891560	if it is a large sample
2891800	2893040	it is such a phenomenon
2893240	2893920	so I think
2894960	2895360	that is
2895640	2896320	to reflect back
2896320	2896880	this question
2896880	2897400	is to say
2897720	2898520	this is actually
2899000	2900160	in your observation
2900160	2900840	will
2900840	2901560	this thing
2901560	2902120	is for you
2902120	2902520	the whole
2902520	2903440	discovery of research
2903440	2903800	is
2904560	2904920	there
2904920	2905840	an alternative
2905840	2906640	mechanism
2908520	2908840	I do not know
2908840	2909000	my
2909000	2909240	yes
2910320	2911040	I think
2911200	2912200	pretty clear
2912440	2912680	yes
2912680	2913480	this is indeed
2913640	2914000	our
2914000	2914760	inside the sample
2914840	2915360	is actually quite
2915360	2916400	homogenous
2916600	2917240	most
2917240	2917760	are
2917760	2918440	quite good
2918440	2919200	education level
2919200	2919440	and then
2919440	2919960	because Boston
2919960	2920960	is a lot of universities
2920960	2921320	and then
2921560	2922360	Boston population
2922360	2923000	itself is
2923000	2923800	mainly white people
2923800	2924080	and then
2924080	2924600	the proportion of black people
2924600	2925120	is quite small
2925120	2925600	Asians
2925600	2926400	more than black people
2926600	2927200	so this is a
2927200	2928120	quite strange structure
2928320	2928800	and then
2929600	2930080	I only
2930080	2930840	discussed with my boss
2930840	2931400	this issue
2931400	2931720	and then
2931960	2932360	he
2932480	2933480	gave me a
2933560	2934600	get over it
2934760	2935240	that
2935360	2936000	explanation is
2936080	2936760	we can say
2936760	2937320	a bit like
2937320	2938040	we are in the sample
2938040	2938560	regress
2938560	2939120	this
2939520	2940000	impression
2940200	2940520	but
2940600	2940880	even if
2940880	2941200	regress
2941200	2941680	this impression
2941680	2942520	we still have to see
2942680	2943320	common
2943320	2943800	those
2944040	2945120	environmental factors
2945120	2945840	that we can
2946040	2947000	focus on
2947120	2947480	if
2947480	2947680	good
2947680	2948080	we know
2948080	2948840	is not SES
2948840	2949800	that we can think about
2949800	2950280	that other
2950280	2950720	is what
2950720	2951000	environmental
2951000	2951560	common factors
2951560	2952520	can explain this
2952760	2953200	we find
2953200	2954280	those factors
2955280	2955520	right
2956520	2956720	that
2956920	2957200	is
2957200	2957600	that the problem
2957600	2958320	does exist in our
2958320	2958800	sample
2958800	2959120	that we
2959120	2960320	think of another way
2960320	2960640	to
2961040	2961880	how to be more effective
2961880	2962520	to use our
2962520	2962960	data
2962960	2963440	like this
2967080	2967600	I also have
2967600	2968280	understand
2969200	2969720	I also have a
2969720	2970720	curious question
2970720	2971400	that is
2971560	2972120	I am watching
2972120	2972560	your
2972560	2972800	this
2972920	2973920	research
2973920	2974400	because its
2974400	2975080	sample size
2975080	2975720	is very large
2976120	2976880	and
2976880	2977360	its
2977640	2978560	cross-age
2978560	2979560	is several
2979800	2980240	so
2981000	2981440	your
2981440	2982240	dropout rate
2982480	2983560	is probably how high
2983760	2984800	and I was thinking
2984800	2985280	if
2985680	2986720	very low
2986800	2987280	is not
2987280	2987920	related to
2987920	2988240	just
2988240	2988880	high-risk
2988880	2989360	because you
2989360	2990040	here
2991080	2992040	is the participant
2992040	2993280	it has a very special
2993280	2993760	this
2994160	2994520	high
2994520	2995160	SES
2995160	2996000	situation
2996360	2996760	right
3000240	3000520	right
3000520	3001680	I
3001680	3002400	must say
3002400	3002920	I think
3002920	3003800	300 pairs of twins
3003800	3004480	is not a very large
3004480	3005120	sample size
3005120	3005360	is
3005360	3006000	Robin Pullman
3006000	3007480	he was invited to the UK
3007480	3008200	they are doing
3008200	3009560	more than 7,000 pairs of twins
3009560	3010000	so I think
3010840	3011320	can not be compared
3011520	3011920	then
3012680	3013440	our dropout rate
3013680	3015120	in the first year is probably 10%
3015120	3016000	the second year is probably
3016000	3017320	12-13%
3017760	3018120	or so
3018920	3019320	so
3020360	3020920	I think it is a
3020920	3022240	state that can be accepted
3022240	3022440	because
3022680	3023120	mainly
3023280	3024240	as we have talked about
3024240	3024520	our
3024720	3026120	twin study assumption is
3026320	3027000	still twins
3027000	3028240	is 50% of the gene
3028240	3029200	that is on average
3029200	3029400	so
3029600	3030360	it will affect
3030360	3031040	we have to have
3031200	3032320	enough twins
3032320	3033760	to do this assumption
3033760	3034880	or there will be a lot of
3034880	3035360	bias
3036520	3036920	thank you
3036920	3037120	thank you
3037120	3037400	that
3037920	3038280	is not possible
3039040	3039680	I think
3039680	3040480	in Boston
3040480	3041240	the benefit of the case
3041240	3042160	should indeed be
3042640	3044720	parents will be more willing
3045320	3046000	to contribute
3046000	3047440	their children to the CNS
3051240	3052760	there are other questions?
3057280	3058240	Then I will jump to
3058240	3058880	the last slide
3059080	3059680	so it is
3059680	3060920	a simple summary
3061400	3062440	of the first behavior study
3062440	3062960	it is a
3062960	3064360	can be studied at the same time
3064600	3065520	genes and environment
3065520	3066080	how to affect
3066080	3067760	an experiment method of individual behavior
3068280	3069120	and then
3070080	3070640	is
3070640	3071440	to respond to
3071440	3073040	the struggle between Socrates and Plato
3073280	3074680	is in our human
3074680	3075560	development process
3075720	3076520	genes and the environment
3076520	3077040	are at the same time
3077040	3078000	have a significant impact
3078000	3078480	like this
3079400	3079600	and then
3079600	3080120	then
3080120	3081040	it is a bit of a response to
3081040	3081400	the previous
3081400	3082440	research by Robert Pullman
3082440	3083240	is that children in
3084200	3085080	the development process
3085080	3085800	is not passive
3085800	3086600	affected by the environment
3086600	3087520	but children's genes
3087520	3088120	will also actively
3088120	3089320	interact with their environment
3089320	3089880	is to produce
3090040	3090560	and then
3090560	3091080	it is
3091080	3091680	we know
3091680	3092720	genes and the environment
3092720	3093960	have a significant impact
3093960	3094800	on the development
3094800	3095480	and this impact
3095480	3096600	will change over time
3097280	3098160	this is the above
3098520	3099440	simple summary
3099440	3101200	of what I have covered today
3101560	3102160	and then
3102160	3102760	here, then
3102760	3103800	you can search
3103800	3104920	is that it will connect to my
3104920	3105920	Facebook Medium
3105920	3106880	or Clubhouse
3107080	3107560	and then
3107560	3108080	Medium
3108080	3108880	there are some
3108880	3109360	that is
3110040	3111200	in the United States
3111200	3111760	some of the
3111760	3112360	Dr.
3112360	3112920	Murmur
3112920	3113440	every month
3113440	3113920	and then
3113920	3114480	if you want to
3114480	3115080	group up
3115080	3115960	can read
3116240	3117160	that if you want to
3117160	3117760	save time
3117760	3118280	I will
3118280	3119240	put it in the description
3119280	3119800	and then
3119800	3120360	if you want to
3120360	3121360	use the social process of the Provincial Office
3121360	3121880	you can
3121880	3123080	send it directly to my email
3123080	3124000	I will also reply
3124000	3124520	like this
3126440	3126960	and then
3126960	3127480	is
3127480	3128480	Q&A time
3128480	3129280	I hope everyone
3129280	3130040	is not like this
3130040	3131080	little friend so confused
3131080	3131600	but
3131600	3132360	very welcome
3132360	3133480	all kinds of discussions
3133480	3134000	like this
3134480	3135600	then I will talk about it here today
3135600	3136280	thank you all
3139080	3139920	I think today
3139920	3140840	is like a word
3140840	3141600	learned a lot
3141600	3142440	this is not a course
3142440	3143040	because
3143040	3143680	that is
3144320	3144880	as a
3144880	3145880	developmental psychology
3145880	3146640	PhD student
3146640	3147120	is
3147440	3148680	often in the course
3149080	3149680	a lot of
3149680	3150960	research on this
3150960	3151760	but I think
3151760	3152240	is
3152240	3152760	a word
3152760	3153560	that can be like
3153560	3154520	I think there
3154520	3155720	may be related areas
3155720	3156840	may be different areas
3156840	3158160	can be very clear
3158160	3158680	put a
3158680	3159960	I think it may be quite complicated
3159960	3160640	that model
3160640	3161080	with
3161080	3161640	I
3161640	3162520	although you just
3162520	3163280	have very humble
3163280	3164080	said more than 300 teams
3164080	3164960	very little but
3164960	3165480	I think
3165480	3166280	300 teams
3166280	3167080	quite a lot
3167080	3167560	so
3167560	3168120	I think I can put
3168120	3169120	such a large-scale research
3169120	3169920	so clearly
3169920	3170360	I think
3170360	3171680	is a very difficult thing
3171680	3172320	and I think
3172320	3173120	it is really clear
3173120	3173800	and so interesting
3173800	3174280	and
3174280	3175480	the picture is so beautiful
3175480	3176040	so
3176040	3177240	now I will
3177280	3178880	play this Q&A time
3178880	3179360	so that
3179360	3180320	everyone can
3180320	3181520	freely discuss
3181520	3182640	and ask questions
3182640	3183000	that
3183000	3184360	everyone is like just the same
3184360	3185240	is that you can
3185240	3186640	unmute your own
3186640	3186960	that
3186960	3187400	audio
3187400	3188640	directly ask the question
3189120	3190200	thank you Yizi
3190680	3191560	thank you
3198600	3199040	that
3199040	3200440	Gao Xian to vote a question
3201280	3201880	this is
3202760	3203160	good
3203160	3204440	this is actually my first
3204440	3205320	model is
3205320	3206400	particularly interested
3206400	3207720	course the second is also very interesting
3207720	3208080	because it is
3208080	3209160	talking about stability
3209160	3209680	but I think
3209680	3210400	your first model
3210400	3210720	is that
3210720	3211440	in fact, you have talked about
3211440	3211800	a
3211800	3212320	conclusion
3212320	3212960	you say
3214360	3214800	that
3214800	3215600	emotion
3215600	3215800	that
3215800	3216440	affect
3216440	3217240	it to
3217240	3217680	score
3217680	3218400	readiness
3218400	3218840	is
3218840	3220040	no prediction effect
3220720	3221440	but I
3221440	3222000	look at
3222000	3222880	your this
3223400	3224240	what is this called
3224240	3224800	trusty
3224800	3225440	?
3225440	3225640	the
3225640	3226320	model
3226320	3227080	you do not seem
3228360	3229400	that you do not seem to use
3229400	3229880	affect
3229880	3230640	to predict
3230640	3231000	score
3231000	3231600	readiness
3231600	3231840	you want
3231840	3232200	because
3232200	3232800	I put
3232800	3233360	you this
3233360	3233760	think of
3233760	3233920	that
3233920	3234280	structural
3234280	3234640	equation
3234640	3234680	of
3234680	3235320	modeling
3235360	3236120	that is behind
3236120	3236480	those
3236480	3236760	circles
3236760	3237280	I treat it as
3237280	3237600	random
3237600	3238320	variable
3238320	3238600	then I
3238600	3239000	want to say
3239000	3239320	your
3239320	3239800	you do not seem to
3239800	3240560	go to pull
3240560	3241000	affect
3241000	3241680	to predict
3241680	3242000	score
3242000	3242720	readiness
3242720	3243200	and
3243200	3243720	a little curious
3243720	3243960	you this
3243960	3244760	conclusion is
3244760	3246000	how to come
3246000	3246320	is
3246320	3246720	I
3246720	3247240	is not I
3247240	3247640	for this
3247640	3247880	model
3247880	3248040	did not
3248040	3248440	particularly
3248440	3248840	did not
3248840	3249240	understand
3249240	3249720	clearly
3250480	3251040	no no no
3251040	3251720	I think you look very
3251720	3252160	careful
3252160	3253000	so you mean
3253000	3253360	this
3253360	3253680	path
3253680	3254280	did not
3254280	3254680	show
3254960	3255200	did not
3255200	3255960	be pulled up
3258480	3259120	I can not see
3259120	3259680	your arrow
3259680	3260040	now
3260040	3260520	can
3261000	3261600	this is your
3261600	3262120	affect
3263840	3264200	so you
3264200	3264680	must
3264680	3265320	from A2
3265320	3265720	to score
3265720	3266280	readiness
3266280	3266480	because I
3266480	3267000	originally thought
3267000	3267560	you said
3267560	3268200	because your
3268200	3268440	your
3268440	3268800	following
3268800	3269080	conclusion
3269080	3269280	above
3269280	3269600	is written
3269600	3269760	that
3269760	3270160	affect
3270160	3270360	did not
3270360	3270680	predict
3270680	3271400	effect
3271400	3271640	so I
3271640	3271880	originally
3271880	3272160	expected
3272160	3272480	you should
3272480	3272840	pull
3272840	3273040	a
3273040	3273560	affect
3273560	3274000	to
3275960	3276640	the second point
3276640	3276960	affect
3276960	3277440	does not
3277440	3278320	unique
3278320	3279080	contributed
3279080	3279480	to
3279480	3279760	score
3279760	3280400	readiness
3280400	3280600	so I
3280600	3280840	originally
3280840	3281120	expected
3281120	3281360	you this
3281360	3281640	sentence
3281640	3281960	should be
3281960	3282640	to say
3282640	3282960	your
3282960	3283360	affect
3283360	3283720	to pull
3283720	3284760	a line
3284760	3285040	then
3285040	3285200	to
3285200	3285640	predict
3285640	3286200	that
3286920	3287200	score
3287200	3287880	readiness
3289400	3289760	I
3289760	3290320	understand
3290800	3291360	I think
3291360	3291600	this
3291600	3291960	model
3291960	3292520	it is
3292520	3292960	put
3292960	3293680	three variables
3294640	3294880	and then
3294880	3295360	pull
3295360	3295600	out
3295600	3296080	up
3296080	3296880	so it is
3297320	3297800	not like
3297800	3298280	SEM
3298280	3298520	it is
3298520	3299600	pull it up
3299600	3300160	and then
3300520	3300960	these
3300960	3301400	factors
3301400	3302400	they are
3302400	3302680	each other
3302680	3303240	independent
3303240	3303560	so it
3303560	3303920	does not
3303920	3304360	affect
3304360	3305080	the path
3305520	3306000	and
3306640	3306960	it
3306960	3307400	I
3307400	3308120	I will write
3308120	3308440	that
3308440	3309040	affect
3309040	3309640	it
3309640	3310200	to

3311640	3312080	unique
3312080	3312520	impact
3312520	3313640	is because
3314320	3314760	this
3314760	3315040	path
3315040	3315400	is not
3315400	3316080	limited
3316080	3316840	so
3316840	3317640	independent
3317640	3318200	score
3318920	3319360	sorry

3322160	3322560	these
3322560	3323320	genes
3323320	3323800	it
3323800	3324320	is not
3324320	3324840	significantly
3324840	3325320	affect
3325320	3325560	score
3325560	3326520	readiness
3326520	3327160	so
3327160	3328080	can explain
3328080	3328480	affect
3328480	3328840	and score
3328840	3329240	readiness
3329240	3330680	behind the same

3332640	3332920	this
3332920	3333640	gene
3335600	3335880	so
3335880	3336120	there
3336120	3336840	is clear
3340240	3340440	oh
3340440	3340840	understand
3340840	3341000	so
3341000	3341560	you actually
3341560	3342200	refer to
3342200	3342600	special
3342600	3343040	is
3343040	3343520	gene
3343520	3344040	performance
3344040	3344200	ah
3344200	3344800	gene
3344800	3345920	part of the
3345920	3346000	explanation
3346000	3346520	is not actually
3346520	3346800	the whole
3346800	3347520	affect
3347520	3347600	is
3347600	3347800	this
3347800	3348080	meaning
3348080	3348360	right
3348360	3348840	understand
3348840	3349240	understand
3354320	3354600	and then
3354600	3354840	I
3354840	3355360	also
3355360	3356640	if you do not have
3356640	3357640	a question
3357640	3359120	then I will continue to ask you
3359120	3359920	is that I am
3359920	3361200	very interested
3361200	3361680	in your first video
3361680	3362760	or the next video
3362760	3363240	is
3363240	3363560	that
3363560	3364080	I seem to see
3364080	3364920	that you have a lot of
3364920	3365200	BART
3365200	3365840	and then go to see
3365840	3366400	that gene
3366400	3367000	explanation
3367000	3367920	this thing
3367920	3368400	and then
3368400	3369120	is
3369120	3370040	a twin
3370040	3370360	ah
3370360	3370760	this
3370760	3371040	this
3371040	3371800	that BART
3371800	3372360	is not
3372360	3372720	that
3372720	3373560	um
3373560	3374200	on another
3374200	3374800	BART
3374800	3375080	is
3375080	3375800	related to
3375800	3376360	that
3376360	3376880	is
3376880	3377640	to feel
3377640	3377960	up
3377960	3378400	I directly
3378400	3378920	from that
3378920	3379400	point of view
3379400	3379920	feel
3379920	3380400	right
3380400	3381400	ah
3381400	3381920	ah
3381920	3382920	temperament
3382960	3383440	temperament
3383440	3383760	I guess
3383760	3384120	we are at an
3384120	3385120	estimate
3385120	3385560	right
3385560	3385840	and then
3385840	3386040	I
3386040	3386240	from
3386240	3386360	your
3386360	3386760	another
3386760	3387080	picture
3387080	3387800	I feel
3387800	3388480	is
3388480	3389440	ah
3389440	3389840	especially
3389840	3389960	is
3389960	3390400	AFET
3390400	3390760	is
3390760	3391320	there a
3391320	3392600	special
3392600	3393800	strong
3393800	3395200	gene prediction effect
3395200	3395560	compared to
3395560	3396040	other
3396040	3397000	like what
3397000	3397480	ah
3397480	3398120	text
3398120	3398760	orientation
3398760	3399080	I
3399080	3399400	I guess
3399400	3400560	this is actually
3400560	3401120	inhibitory
3401120	3401520	control
3401520	3402280	of a kind
3402280	3402680	I do not know
3402680	3403600	I am
3403600	3404880	not familiar with this
3404880	3405280	so feel
3405280	3405560	it seems
3405560	3405880	should be
3405880	3407120	self-regulation
3407120	3407440	a
3407440	3408280	phenomenon
3408280	3408560	so I
3408560	3409760	actually
3409760	3410600	for
3410600	3411080	this result
3411080	3411600	quite
3411600	3412120	curious
3412120	3412840	why
3412840	3413800	this self-regulation
3413800	3414280	this text
3414280	3414960	orientation
3414960	3415960	it is actually
3415960	3417560	no gene
3417560	3418440	prediction effect
3418440	3418760	ah
3418760	3420160	no gene
3420160	3420840	can explain
3420840	3421240	because the place
3421240	3421840	related to
3421840	3422600	relatively low
3422600	3423920	than AFET
3423920	3424320	ah
3424320	3424680	than
3424680	3424920	prediction
3424920	3425760	still low
3425760	3426440	so I am quite curious
3426440	3426800	that
3426800	3427160	your
3427160	3427680	explanation of
3427680	3428640	that
3428640	3429480	method
3432800	3433520	I think this approach
3433520	3434600	quite interesting
3434600	3435160	well
3435160	3436280	if AFET
3436280	3437080	I just
3437080	3437800	first thought
3437800	3438800	is that it can actually
3438800	3439240	from
3439240	3439640	our
3439640	3439840	ah
3439840	3440480	blah blah blah
3440480	3442280	we do not know how to see
3442280	3443600	animation is really a bit of trouble
3443600	3443960	is
3443960	3444680	because you can
3444680	3445280	indeed see
3445280	3445840	it in addition to
3445840	3446800	A3 this factor
3446800	3447840	to explain AFET
3447840	3449240	it has its own independent
3449240	3449680	equivalent to
3449680	3450880	it seems to have two
3450880	3451760	genetic factors
3451760	3453280	to explain AFET
3453280	3453640	so
3453640	3454440	I would think
3454440	3455360	we see in AFET
3455360	3456080	relatively high
3456080	3456480	that
3456480	3457160	heritability
3457160	3458680	is quite reasonable
3458680	3459360	but
3459360	3460040	talk about
3460040	3460480	why
3460480	3461480	task orientation
3461480	3462240	its
3462240	3462840	ah
3462840	3463720	gene
3463720	3464600	ratio looks
3464600	3466240	not very high
3467760	3468560	I think
3468560	3469520	this is very interesting
3469760	3471040	I have not thought about this issue
3471720	3473040	I want to plug in
3473040	3473960	because you just talked about that
3473960	3474680	Charles
3474680	3475520	I will not read
3475520	3475960	Charles
3475960	3476920	Ferski
3476920	3478160	of that model
3479200	3479960	is good
3479960	3480640	that model
3480640	3481240	is
3481240	3482000	you
3482000	3483040	if you put that order
3483040	3483720	transferred
3483720	3484280	you put
3484280	3484560	ah
3484560	3485920	I can look at the next picture
3485920	3486760	you put that
3486760	3487360	task
3487360	3487680	ah
3487680	3488560	task orientation
3488560	3489160	and AFET
3489160	3489400	two
3489400	3490320	contrast
3490320	3491720	in fact, there will be similar things
3491720	3492640	because it is actually
3492640	3493280	put
3493280	3493760	that
3493760	3494400	for example, A3
3494400	3495120	you can also put
3495120	3496040	predict
3496040	3496760	task
3496760	3497320	AFET
3497320	3498040	ah
3498040	3499160	school readiness
3499160	3499880	and A2
3499880	3501120	only predict
3501120	3501840	task
3501840	3502920	orientation
3502920	3503720	so it can actually
3503720	3505240	it is just a partial out
3505240	3505880	is to pull it
3505880	3507680	FERS process only
3507680	3508920	so in fact, I look back
3508920	3509600	it seems
3509600	3510800	I am still very confused
3510800	3511560	why
3511560	3512400	task orientation
3512400	3513080	so
3513080	3513760	I think
3513760	3514920	it should be a pretty
3514920	3515920	gene
3515920	3516560	thing
3516560	3517400	is self-adjustment
3517400	3518440	compared to AFET
3518440	3518600	ah
3518600	3519880	I do not dare to say
3519880	3520480	I do not
3520480	3520760	just
3520760	3521320	in short, I think
3521320	3522480	it should also have
3522480	3523600	a lot of
3523600	3524920	gene performance
3524920	3525560	but from just
3525560	3526280	your picture
3526280	3527000	from your bar
3527000	3528480	you can clearly see that
3528480	3529400	it seems that the gene
3529400	3529920	that performance
3529920	3531360	is particularly low
3531360	3532000	that I do not know
3532000	3532440	is not because you
3532440	3533120	now this child
3533120	3534080	only three years old
3534080	3534680	because the child
3534680	3536320	is probably around two years old
3536320	3537280	his
3537280	3538640	self-regulation
3538640	3539440	will be more
3539440	3540640	formal
3540640	3541480	I do not know if it is because of the dissection
3541480	3542120	but I think
3542120	3542400	three years old
3542400	3543840	in fact, it should be quite complete
3543840	3544400	but I think
3544400	3544880	I do not know if it is because
3544880	3546280	he is still relatively young
3546280	3547080	so
3547080	3547760	self-regulation
3547760	3548640	has not been completely
3548640	3549280	really
3549280	3550360	good
3550360	3551240	test
3551240	3551880	and so on
3551880	3552480	I do not know
3552480	3553440	I do not know what your explanation
3553440	3554040	will be
3554040	3554560	well
3556200	3557400	I think
3557400	3557920	it is interesting
3558040	3559680	I will answer it one by one
3559680	3560560	I think the first question
3560560	3562080	is a very expert question
3562080	3563120	is about the model
3563120	3564720	how to put those items
3564720	3565120	indeed
3565120	3566600	if you want to calculate some
3566600	3567200	is that you finally
3567200	3568800	pull out of the thing
3568800	3569640	you do not care how to put
3569640	3570480	calculated
3570480	3571400	estimated heritability
3571400	3572440	will be the same
3572440	3572920	but
3572920	3573840	we will put here
3573840	3574480	the reason is because
3574480	3575600	past research has known
3575600	3576320	task orientation
3576320	3577120	and score readiness
3577120	3578360	are related
3578360	3579000	so that
3579000	3580080	it is actually not a
3580080	3581400	particularly interesting phenomenon
3581400	3582800	that we are interested in is
3582800	3584480	affect and score readiness
3584480	3585520	they will not actually have
3585520	3586480	a unique
3586520	3587400	score readiness
3587400	3588280	related
3588280	3589560	so we put it in the second
3589560	3590240	that is to say
3590240	3591000	if these two
3591000	3592200	paths are obvious
3592200	3593120	it can be said
3593120	3593960	oh, we guessed
3593960	3594680	that is right
3594680	3596000	but we guessed wrong
3596000	3596480	so
3596480	3597480	its order
3597480	3598520	can
3598520	3599520	reflect some of our
3599520	3600680	questions we want to ask
3600680	3601240	then
3601240	3601840	score readiness
3601840	3602560	put at the end
3602560	3603320	means
3603320	3604160	it actually
3604160	3605000	we want to see
3605000	3605600	unique
3605600	3606600	for score readiness
3606600	3608120	those effects
3608120	3608840	because we actually
3608840	3609480	really interesting
3609480	3609880	is not the
3609880	3610360	temperament
3610360	3610920	we are interested in
3610920	3611480	it
3611480	3611880	temperament
3611880	3612640	and score readiness
3612640	3613160	related
3613160	3613640	with
3613640	3614280	score readiness
3614280	3614680	itself
3614680	3614880	in the end
3614880	3615240	what
3615240	3615920	special
3615920	3616360	effect
3616360	3617360	like this
3617760	3618640	so
3618640	3618920	that is
3618920	3620120	the order of the model
3620120	3621120	will
3621120	3621680	affect
3621680	3622640	how we want
3622640	3623520	to be more
3623520	3624280	effective
3624280	3625000	and convenient
3625000	3626520	to explain this model
3626520	3627440	then
3628400	3629280	I think
3629280	3630240	that
3630240	3631640	question of heritability
3631640	3632680	can look at
3632680	3633320	this path
3633320	3634880	so we can see here
3634880	3635120	that is
3635120	3635600	this path
3635600	3636080	square
3636080	3636640	will be its
3636640	3637480	heritability
3637480	3637720	so
3637720	3638120	here
3638120	3638880	calculated
3638880	3639240	actually
3639240	3639960	gene can explain
3639960	3640840	about 40%
3640840	3641840	variance
3643440	3643960	for
3643960	3644960	task orientation
3646360	3646880	so
3646880	3647360	actually
3647360	3647880	not particularly
3647880	3648400	low
3648400	3648840	although
3648840	3649360	in the
3649360	3649880	bar graph
3649880	3650360	inside
3650360	3650920	does not look
3650920	3651440	high
3651440	3651920	but
3651920	3652440	it is actually
3652440	3652960	explained
3652960	3653960	about 40%
3653960	3654960	right
3655960	3656440	I'm here
3656440	3657440	to interrupt
3657440	3658440	as a host
3658440	3659440	is
3659440	3660440	the time factor
3660440	3661440	because I think
3661440	3662440	there should be
3662440	3663440	some later
3663440	3664440	is
3664440	3665440	more detailed discussion
3665440	3666440	that
3666440	3667440	because I want to say
3667440	3668440	that we are now
3668440	3669440	recording
3669440	3670440	that do not know
3670440	3671440	if it can be a little bit
3671440	3672440	interrupted discussion here
3672440	3673440	and then I want
3673440	3674440	as a host
3674440	3675440	is to ask
3675520	3676520	that
3676520	3677520	I do not know
3677520	3678520	in today's
3678520	3679520	speech
3679520	3680520	is now here
3680520	3681520	to a paragraph
3681520	3682520	you have anything
3682520	3683520	that you know
3683520	3684520	in addition to just
3684520	3685520	the last slide
3685520	3686520	of take home
3686520	3687520	message
3687520	3688520	you have anything
3688520	3689520	that is more personal
3689520	3690520	a few words of
3690520	3691520	personality
3691520	3692520	want to talk to
3692520	3693520	Project Tara
3693520	3694520	for example,
3694520	3695520	after listening to
3695520	3696520	the audience
3696520	3697520	of this video
3697520	3698520	can share
3698520	3699520	that
3699520	3700520	may be
3700520	3701520	after you say
3701520	3702520	a few words
3702520	3703520	I will stop recording
3703520	3704520	here first
3704600	3705600	and then with us
3705600	3706600	live
3706600	3707600	or future audience
3707600	3708600	can share
3708600	3709600	some of you
3709600	3710600	do this
3710600	3711600	very interesting research
3711600	3712600	and I think
3712600	3713600	it is rare to study
3713600	3714600	some of you know
3714600	3715600	that is more personal
3715600	3716600	ideas
3716600	3717600	or something
3717600	3718600	I did not expect
3718600	3719600	this part
3719600	3720600	but I think
3720600	3721600	I want to say
3721600	3722600	a lot of things
3722600	3723600	are put in
