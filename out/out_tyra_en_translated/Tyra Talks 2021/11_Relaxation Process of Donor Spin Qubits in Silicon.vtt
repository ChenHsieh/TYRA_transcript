00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on November 14th.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
We are honored to have Yuli Xue as our speaker today.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
She is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New South Wales.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Her doctoral program is at Purdue University, EECS.

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
Her research focuses on physics and the defects in semiconductors.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Her research focuses on simulation, but has a close relationship with experiments.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
Today's topic is the relaxation process of donor spin-tubing in silica.

01:04.000 --> 01:21.000
Before we get started, let's give Yuli a round of applause.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
Now we will hand over to Yuli.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
Today I will be talking about how to use donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
And how the relaxation process plays an important role.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
There are five parts to this talk.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
The first part is about quantum computing.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
There are many different types of quantum computing.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
Some people use superconducting qubits, others use topological qubits.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Today I will focus on semiconductor qubits.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
I will be using donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Next I will talk about spin relaxation.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
What does it have to do with quantum computing?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
How does it help to calculate spin relaxation time?

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Next I will talk about how to calculate spin relaxation time.

02:44.000 --> 02:59.000
Lastly, I will talk about the results of the experiment.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
The first part is about quantum computing.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
What are the differences between classical and quantum computers?

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
For classical qubits, you can only choose either 0 or 1.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
For quantum qubits, you can choose either 0 or 1.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
This means that when you operate on quantum qubits, you can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
If you only have a single qubit, it doesn't seem very powerful.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
However, if you have two qubits, you can operate on four states.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Quantum computers can operate on these four states at the same time.

03:49.000 --> 03:57.000
If you have n qubits, you can operate on 2n qubits at the same time.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
This is very powerful.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
If you want to solve the riddle, you can try the first method.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
If it doesn't work, you can try the second method.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
If it doesn't work, you can try the third method.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Quantum computers can try 100 methods at a time.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Quantum computers can solve complex problems in a short time.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Quantum computers can be used widely.

04:26.000 --> 04:35.000
For example, data security, database search, quantum chemistry, or machine learning.

04:35.000 --> 04:45.000
Next, I will introduce the most basic unit of quantum computers.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Quantum computers are mainly composed of 0 and 1 like classical qubits.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Quantum computers can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
We use the block sphere as a representation.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
Quantum computers can not only operate on two qubits, but also on a channel or other points.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
This information is very important.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
Quantum computers can use quantum operators such as linear or horizontal derivatives.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron spin, downspin, offspin, nuclear spin, or upspin, downspin.

05:27.000 --> 05:37.000
Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron ground state and first excited state.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
For example, if we take electron spin as an example,

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
1 is upspin, 0 is downspin.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
This is our single qubit.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
First, we need to add magnetic field.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
Electron spin is a magnet.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
When it is parallel to the magnetic field or in the opposite direction, its energy will be different.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
When the energy of the magnetic field is split, the two states are separated.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
If we want to operate electron spin, we can add an AC magnetic field.

06:23.000 --> 06:32.000
If the frequency of the AC magnetic field and the energy of the AC magnetic field are matched,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
a resonance will occur.

06:35.000 --> 06:45.000
The resonance will go from 1 to 0, then to 1, then to 0, then to 1.

06:45.000 --> 06:57.000
The definition of qubit operation is the time evolution of two coherent states.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
For example, we can measure the qubit after a certain period of time.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
We will find that the qubit is originally in state 1, but after a certain period of time, it becomes 0.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
In this way, we can realize the NOT gate in logic design.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
This is our single qubit operation.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
If we have two qubits, the most famous gate is called CNOT gate.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
CNOT gate means that when we have control qubit, control bit and target bit,

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
when the control bit is 0, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
When the control bit is 1, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
This is CNOT gate.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
How to use electron spin?

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
There is an interaction between two electron spins called exchange interaction.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
If they work, it means that when the control spin is in the up spin and it is in the down spin,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
the effect of the second electron spin is different.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
How is it different?

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
For example, when you turn to this channel, the speed of the precessed channel will be different.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
When you measure, the spin is still in the down spin.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
But in this case, because the control spin is different from the other direction,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
the spin turns faster.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Because of the interaction, the spin turns faster.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
When you measure, the spin is in the up spin.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Originally, the spin is in the down spin, but now it is in the up spin.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
One spin is not changed, and the other spin is changed.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
This is how CNOT gate is realized.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
If we have a single qubit gate and CNOT gate,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
we can do quantum computation,

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
which is to realize a universal quantum computation.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
Next, we will introduce the donor spin qubit.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
For example, we need an electron spin to store 0 and 1.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
But we need to localize the electron spin.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
For example, there are so many electrons in silicon solid.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
How do we know which one we want to control?

09:42.000 --> 09:52.000
The concept is that the silicon and the phosphorus are next to each other.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
One has 14 electrons, and the other has 15 electrons.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
When you take out a silicon and replace it with phosphorus,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
it will have one more electron.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.000
In this way, the electron will go around the sphere.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
The premise is that the electron will not run away at low temperature.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
If it is at high temperature, it will run away when the energy is high.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
This is our main structure.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
The advantage is that the strain is very small.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
It does not squeeze to the side.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
Because they are next to each other, the quality is very close.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
In 1998, Bruce Kane proposed this proposal.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
He said that he wanted to put phosphorus in a certain position,

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
confine an electron, and use it as a quantum computer.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
First, we need to encode 0 and 1 in the electron's up-spin and down-spin,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
or in the donor's up-spin and down-spin, or in the nuclear's up-spin and down-spin.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Next, we need a low temperature.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
This way, the electron will run around here.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.000
How do we realize the single-qubit gate and the two-qubit gate?

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
For the single-qubit gate, we can use the magnetic field of the AC.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
We try to have resonance with it.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
The resonance frequency can be controlled by the gate above.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
For example, if the gate is positive, the electron will be sucked up.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
In this way, the resonance frequency will change.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
When the electron is sucked up, the distance between it and the nucleus is large,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
and the interaction between them is small.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
The interaction will affect the resonance frequency.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
In this way, for example,

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
if the two-qubit gate is coupled with a different bias,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
the two-qubit gate will have different resonance frequencies.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
If we only want to operate the left-hand qubit,

12:24.000 --> 12:34.000
we can tune the magnetic field of the AC to match the resonance frequency.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
At this time, only the left-hand qubit will rotate,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
and the right-hand qubit will not be affected.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
In this way, we can operate the left-hand qubit or the right-hand qubit.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
As for the two-qubit gate,

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
as mentioned earlier, the two electrons will have an exchange interaction.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
If the J-gate in the middle does not turn on,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
the two qubits will not interact.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Their interaction is very weak.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
For example, if I add a qubit and suck two electrons in the middle,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
their wave function overlap will be very large,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
and their interaction will be very strong.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Then we can do the so-called C-knot gate.

13:26.000 --> 13:41.000
Can you tell me how much is the ionization energy of this electron?

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Or if you can use the photon frequency,

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
and what is the energy of the splitting next to it?

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
First of all, the ionization energy is 45.6 mEV.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
So mEV is about gigahertz,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
which is about this range.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
For the Zeeman splitting,

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
the Zeeman splitting of the electron is also about 0.1 to 1 mEV.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
If your magnetic field is between 1 Tesla to 10 Tesla,

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
your Zeeman splitting is also in the range of gigahertz.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
If it is a nuclear spin,

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
then the Zeeman splitting will be about 1000 times smaller.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Don't tell me that your temperature is 100 mC.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Isn't that a bit too high?

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Your thermal radiation seems to be in this range.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Too high.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Because if it is 1K,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
it is about 100 gigahertz.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
So if it is 100 mC,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
it is about 10 gigahertz.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
A little higher than you.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Isn't that too high?

15:08.000 --> 15:25.000
You mean the energy difference is too small, right?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
No, I mean,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
in the environment of 100 mC photon bath,

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
all your states can be randomized.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Or you can analyze them directly.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Sorry.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Wait a minute.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Ted, your microphone is on.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
There seems to be some noise over there.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Can you mute it directly?

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Okay, I will mute it directly.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You can continue to discuss.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
You mean photon or phonon?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Photon.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I just want to know

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
where is your operating energy scale now.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
So what is the temperature of your environment

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
to become the so-called environment without interference?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
There should be no photon here.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
No, there are photons everywhere, right?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It should be phonon.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
But it is phonon.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It should be phonon.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
No, even if you are in the cryostat,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
there will be thermal radiation if there is temperature.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Right?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Yes.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
Otherwise, how do you define vacuum temperature?

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Thermal radiation.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
This is what the theorists are talking about now.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
In the end, there may be real problems in the experiment.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
We will see its performance later.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Okay, let me see if I can finish later.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Actually, I am quite curious about the different approaches.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
For example, what is the difference between the cryostat and the constraint?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I am mainly curious about this.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Sorry, I am not sure if I can answer your question.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
But we can discuss it later.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay, we can discuss it later.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Thank you.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I have a question here.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Hello.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Hi.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I have a question.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
I think B and TESLA are quite big.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Why are they so different?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Why are they so different?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Yes.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
The first B is for z-splitting.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
The first B is for z-splitting.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
It is connected to the resonance frequency.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.140
It is connected to the resonance frequency.

18:12.140 --> 18:17.900
It shows how much the AC magnetic field is.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.900
However, its strength is different.

18:20.900 --> 18:28.900
Its strength is depend on the Robeot oscillation.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.900
But, its strength is quite slow eventually.

18:31.900 --> 18:36.000
You don't have to be fast to use Robeot oscillation.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Because

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
So, your BAC will correspond to the size of the off-diagonal term.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Yes.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
What is B?

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
B is the size of the Zeeman speeding.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It is the inch gap.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Yes.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Ok.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I am curious.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Why don't you need to use Robeot oscillation?

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
I am not sure how much T1 and T2 are in this system.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Can you tell me the number?

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Why don't you want the quantum gate to be faster?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I am a little bit surprised.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Ok.

19:20.000 --> 19:30.000
I am not sure how short the measurement time is.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
Theoretically, T1 and T2 should be faster.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
But, I am not sure what is the limitation in the experiment.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
So, maybe I am wrong.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
T1 and T2 should be faster.

19:49.000 --> 19:56.000
However, T1 is a few seconds.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
T2 is a few seconds.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I don't have a good number.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
However,

20:04.000 --> 20:24.000
the applied AC magnetic field allows Robeot oscillation to reach 10 nanoseconds.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
So, it is pretty fast.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Thank you.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Ok.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I am sorry.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I can comment on this.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
In the experiment,

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
the time resolution is about 1 nanosecond.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It is the shortest.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
It is the shortest.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Ok. Thank you.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I am sorry.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Let me interrupt you.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
Please tell us your name and

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
briefly introduce yourself.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Thank you.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Ok.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I will continue.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So,

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
we want to realize the proposal using STM technique.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
What is STM technique?

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
You have a scanning tunneling microscope tip.

21:24.000 --> 21:33.000
You can remove the silicon in a certain position.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Then, you can dope phosphorus in this position.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
This is actually a very difficult technique.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
In the past, we doped silicon in a more random way.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
We did not particularly control where the phosphorus atom should be placed.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
This scanning tunneling microscope technique can control this.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
It controls this variable.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So,

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
Michelle Siemens Group

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
at UNSW

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
made a device that looks like this.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
The gate and donor are made using STM.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
So,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
the gate is removed and the donor is placed.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
You can control the shape of the gate and the donor.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Another difficult part is

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
to load and read the electrons on the donor.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
In 2010,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Andrew Marlowe

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
used STM to control the Fermi level of the SCT.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
This allows the electrons to be tunneled to the SCT

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
or from the SCT tunnel to the donor.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
When the Fermi level of the SCT is

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
in the middle of the upspin and downspin,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
only the upspin electrons can be tunneled to the SCT.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
The downspin electrons cannot be tunneled to the SCT.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
So, if you measure the current peak,

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
the electrons are on the upspin.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
If you do not measure anything,

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
the electrons are on the downspin.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Then we can measure the electron spin.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
So,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
in 1998,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Ken proposed this proposal.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
In 2010,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Andrew Marlowe did the electron spin readout.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
In 2015,

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
he did the single-qubit gate operation.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
In 2019,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
he did the two-qubit gate operation.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Now,

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
we are going to build a large-scale quantum computer.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Sorry, can I interrupt?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I'm Ted.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Sure.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
You just talked about the readout.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Can you tell us about the single-qubit gate in the middle?

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Which electron does it send to the AC field?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It should be ESR.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yes, it is ESR.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Well,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
it is...

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Well,

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
it is...

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
If it is ESR,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
there is...

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I did not draw it here.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
There is a global...

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
There is a global...

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
There is a global...

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
There is a global...

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
You can produce a globalized AC field

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
and control it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
But there is no...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
But there is no...

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
It is a top-gate or back-gate.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
It is not a...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It is not a...

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It is not a...

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It is not a...

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
It is not a...

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
What are the advantages of the donor spin qubit?

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
First, it has a long coherence time.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
For example,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
the natural silicon is silicon 28.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The nuclear spin is 0.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It means

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
only the donor's nuclear spin and the electron's nuclear spin are not 0.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Most of the other spins have no interaction.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
For example,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
it has a long coherence time.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
It has a clear boundary.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
For example,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
if you have a phosphorus donor,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
it looks the same.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It is very helpful to scale up.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Next,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
the semiconductor industry

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
has a very mature technology for silicon.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
It can be applied later.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It can be applied later.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
The disadvantage is

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
the STM technology

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
The disadvantage is

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
the STM technology

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
We need to control it very carefully.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
We need to control it very carefully.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
We don't know this.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
We don't know this.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
It is not good.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Next,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I have a question.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I want to introduce myself.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I am Zhang Yuanyong.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I am a high-performance physicist.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I am a high-performance physicist.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.000
Before you works

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Before you works

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
before you repairs in the future,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
before you repairs in the future,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
How clean does vapor look?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
How clean does vapor look?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Can we buy it?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.400
Yes,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.000
we just mentioned

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
we just mentioned

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
the natural silicon is still

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
5% silicon-29

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
The silicon-29 means

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
there is a nuclear spin.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
So,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
the trend is

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
to use purified silicon

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
to minimize the silicon-29

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
to minimize the silicon-29

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
So, the requirement is quite high.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So, the requirement is quite high.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I have a follow-up question

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I have a follow-up question

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Is the purified silicon commercially available?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Is the purified silicon commercially available?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Or do we need to make it specially?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I think we need to make it

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
with a special factory

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
not a mass production

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
not a mass production

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm not sure

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
but it seems like this

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Ok, thank you

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Ok, thank you

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Ok, next I will introduce

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
what is spin relaxation

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
what is spin relaxation

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
What is the importance of spin relaxation

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What is the importance of spin relaxation

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
or T1 time?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
First, if you load an electron

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
and you want to read out

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
If you load in up spin

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
then it should be in up spin

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
if you read out

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
If it relaxes in this process

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
If it relaxes in this process

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
from up spin to down spin

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
you will have an error

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
a read out error

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
This error is quite fatal

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
This error is quite fatal

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
We need a lot of design

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
We need a lot of design

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
can handle this error

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
can handle this error

29:17.000 --> 29:17.760
The current design is

29:17.760 --> 29:19.000
The current design is

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
In the case of fidelity

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
99%

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
So we hope

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
in the case of fidelity

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
99%

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
so we hope

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
that the longer the spin relaxation time

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
that the longer the spin relaxation time

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
the longer the spin relaxation time

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
So t 1

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
t 1

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
t 1

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
