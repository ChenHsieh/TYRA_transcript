0	10000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Terra Talk on November 21, 2020.
10000	18000	We are honored to have Dr. Tsing Ke, who just became Dr. Yin Chao yesterday, to give a speech.
18000	24000	The topic of his speech today is Neutron Irradiation Effect on Tom Stanford Nuclear Fusion Reactor.
24000	29000	If you don't know what ITER is, you can google it.
29000	36000	It is basically the world's largest nuclear fusion experiment or nuclear fusion reactor.
36000	40000	Before we start, let me introduce Dr. Yin Chao.
40000	44000	Dr. Yin Chao's main field of research is the field he will talk to us about today,
44000	53000	which is material science, especially nuclear materials, nuclear fusion, tungsten, and neutron irradiation.
53000	58000	In the past, Dr. Yin Chao obtained a master's degree from the Department of Materials at Taipei University of Science and Technology.
58000	65000	After obtaining a master's degree in the same place, he went to UC Berkeley's Department of Nuclear Engineering and obtained a master's degree.
65000	71000	After that, he is now at the Belize Nuclear Research Center,
71000	76000	and also obtained a doctor's degree from the Department of Materials at Ruwen University.
77000	83000	Dr. Yin Chao's research focuses on nuclear power plants floating on the ocean,
83000	88000	and the nuclear fusion reactor material.
88000	93000	Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.
93000	96000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome Dr. Yin Chao for his speech.
101000	104000	Thank you for the introduction.
104000	113000	As I said earlier, my speech will focus on the neutron irradiation effect of nukes.
113000	117000	The nukes will be applied to the nuclear fusion reactor.
125000	126000	Let me introduce my unit first.
126000	129000	Our unit is called SCK-CEN.
129000	132000	SCK and CEN have the same meaning.
132000	137000	SCK stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center,
137000	140000	and CEN stands for Belgian Nuclear Research Center.
140000	142000	Belize is a bilingual country.
142000	147000	Our unit is located in Mol, which is very close to the Netherlands.
147000	149000	Our unit has three reactors,
149000	154000	BR1, BR2, and BR3, which are the Belgian reactors 1, 2, and 3.
154000	158000	BR1 is the earliest reactor.
158000	161000	BR2 is the most recent reactor.
161000	165000	BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.
165000	167000	BR2 is the most recent reactor.
167000	169000	BR2 has a carbon-free reaction.
169000	174000	All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.
174000	177000	All the experiments today are conducted by BR2.
177000	182000	BR2 was originally designed for material testing.
182000	187000	But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,
187000	189000	But because of the collapse of nuclear power industry,
189000	191000	some nuclear accidents occurred,
191000	195000	like Chernobyl and Fukushima.
195000	197000	Since the nuclear industry has fallen,
197000	200000	there are not as many experiments to do the material test.
200000	202000	Since the nuclear industry has fallen, there are not as many experiments to do the material test.
202000	206000	Some part of it has been converted into medical isotopes
206000	211000	and half-body doping.
211000	217000	The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.
217000	224000	The BRS-3 was designed to train the nuclear industry.
224000	228000	But they decided to dismantle it due to some problems.
228000	236000	Now it is a place to study how to retire the nuclear power plant.
236000	241000	Our company built a Mira.
241000	244000	It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.
244000	248000	It is going to replace BR-1, BR-2, and BR-3.
248000	251000	It is a new reactor,
251000	257000	which is controlled by a accelerator.
257000	261000	It is a reactor and accelerator.
261000	264000	If you want to know more about our company,
264000	266000	you can come here.
266000	267000	If you want to know more about our company,
267000	269000	you can come here.
269000	271000	Let's continue.
271000	277000	My speech will be divided into five sections.
277000	280000	First, I will introduce what nuclear fusion is,
280000	282000	what kind of reactor it is,
282000	284000	why we use it,
284000	286000	what materials I tested,
286000	288000	how I tested it,
288000	293000	and the radiation testing.
293000	295000	Next, I will introduce the development method.
295000	298000	I will introduce three methods of development,
298000	300000	three methods of improvement,
300000	303000	to measure radiation.
303000	308000	Next, I will tell you about
308000	313000	the result before and after radiation.
313000	320000	I will tell you about the result before and after radiation.
320000	324000	First, introduction.
324000	325000	As you know,
325000	327000	2 million years ago,
327000	329000	humans discovered fire.
329000	332000	The symbol of the discovery of fire
332000	337000	is that humans began to control chemical energy.
337000	339000	If we did not control chemical energy,
339000	341000	there would be no industrial revolution,
341000	346000	and there would be no modern society.
346000	348000	In the middle of the 20th century,
348000	350000	another important thing happened.
350000	353000	We discovered nuclear energy,
353000	356000	and we learned how to use the energy of nuclear fission
356000	358000	to generate electricity.
358000	360000	We have been using it for more than half a century.
360000	365000	Among them, nuclear fusion is the holy grail of nuclear energy.
365000	369000	If we can control nuclear fusion,
369000	373000	we can get relatively clean energy,
373000	375000	and it is also sustainable.
375000	379000	It can be used for thousands of years.
379000	383000	Because the raw materials can be directly planted in the sea,
383000	387000	or mining lithium.
387000	389000	So basically,
389000	393000	its fuel is non-negotiable.
393000	394000	In addition,
394000	398000	we can even use this energy to expand the universe
398000	403000	and explore in another galaxy.
403000	405000	Because as we know,
405000	407000	if you leave the solar system
407000	409000	or reach the solar system's borders,
409000	410000	you cannot use solar energy
410000	412000	because you are too far from the sun
412000	414000	or too far from any core.
414000	416000	So the efficiency of using solar energy is too low.
416000	417000	If you use chemical energy,
417000	419000	the chemical rocket will not reach that far.
419000	421000	Even if it reaches that far,
421000	422000	if you use a fuel cell,
422000	425000	it will soon run out of fuel.
425000	427000	So the only way is to use nuclear energy.
429000	431000	What is nuclear fusion?
431000	433000	Nuclear fusion is an example of
433000	435000	the reaction of copper and iron.
435000	438000	There are two lighter atoms,
438000	439000	copper and iron,
439000	440000	deuterium and trillium.
440000	443000	They combine to form a heavier atom,
443000	444000	helium,
444000	446000	and release a neutron.
446000	449000	Then you can...
449000	450000	Sorry.
450000	452000	You can see from the picture on the right
452000	455000	that the energy released by fusion
455000	462000	is much higher than that of fission.
462000	464000	This is why we say
464000	468000	that nuclear fusion is the Holy Grail of nuclear energy.
468000	471000	Because the energy obtained
471000	474000	from the same amount of fuel
474000	477000	is about four or five times that of fusion.
478000	481000	Scientists are now studying
481000	484000	how to control nuclear fusion.
484000	487000	There are several types of reactors
487000	489000	that have been proposed.
489000	494000	If you want to make a general classification,
494000	497000	you can classify them into
497000	500000	magnetic fields and inertial fields.
500000	502000	The most famous of the magnetic fields
502000	504000	is the Tokens.
504000	507000	It is also called ITER.
507000	512000	ITER means the way in Latin.
512000	515000	The other one is the Stellarator.
515000	517000	The Stellarator is a centrifuge.
517000	519000	The most famous centrifuge is
519000	522000	the Winchester 7X in Germany.
522000	525000	The most famous inertial confinement
525000	528000	is the National Ignition Facility in the United States.
528000	531000	The National Ignition Facility
531000	534000	in the United States
534000	537000	has a slightly different way
537000	540000	of generating nuclear fusion.
540000	543000	The way it is confined
543000	546000	is the same as its name.
546000	549000	It uses a magnetic field
549000	552000	to confine the electric field.
552000	555000	The electric field is heated to
555000	558000	more than 1.5 billion degrees
558000	561000	to generate nuclear fusion.
561000	564000	The inertial confinement
564000	567000	uses a lot of lasers.
567000	570000	It hits the fuel capsule
570000	573000	to generate high-temperature high-pressure
573000	576000	and small nuclear explosions.
576000	579000	It is a controllable light explosion.
579000	582000	Among all the reactors
582000	585000	I just mentioned,
585000	588000	the one that is the closest
588000	591000	to commercialization
591000	594000	is Tokamak.
594000	597000	The most famous one is ITER.
597000	600000	This is its diagram.
600000	603000	As I mentioned,
603000	606000	ITER uses magnetic field
606000	609000	and the fuel is
609000	612000	a blade and a wire.
612000	615000	The design of the reactor
615000	618000	is postmode,
618000	621000	which is a kind of
621000	624000	pulse-mode reactor.
624000	627000	When the nuclear reaction occurs,
627000	630000	it releases high-energy neutrons
630000	633000	and high-temperature electrons
633000	636000	along the magnetic field.
636000	639000	The high-temperature electrons
639000	642000	are brought along the magnetic field
642000	645000	to the diverter,
645000	648000	which is the red part.
648000	651000	The diverter receives
651000	654000	high neutrons and high-temperature electrons
654000	657000	and is a pulse-mode reactor.
657000	660000	This is a very challenging
660000	663000	and rigorous challenge.
663000	666000	What is a diverter?
666000	669000	You can see the structure of a diverter.
669000	672000	The diverter cassette
672000	675000	is composed of many plasma-facing units.
675000	678000	You can see the plasma-facing units
678000	681000	are arranged one by one.
681000	684000	Each unit is composed of
684000	687000	several tungsten monoblocks
687000	690000	and is connected by a tube.
690000	693000	The tube is used to
693000	696000	let the coolant flow through.
696000	699000	You can see that
699000	702000	in a steady-state operation,
702000	705000	10 MW per m2
705000	708000	is deposited
708000	711000	on the surface of the material.
711000	714000	You can see that
714000	717000	the surface temperature
717000	720000	rises to 1,200 °C.
720000	723000	The temperature drop
723000	726000	is only 8 mm.
726000	729000	This is a very serious impact
729000	732000	on the material.
732000	735000	In addition,
735000	738000	it is a pulse-mode reactor,
738000	741000	which produces fatigue.
741000	744000	The temperature is very high.
744000	747000	It is like the temperature
747000	750000	produced by friction
750000	753000	when a spaceship enters the atmosphere.
753000	756000	This is a very extreme condition.
756000	759000	Why do we choose to use lead?
759000	762000	Because lead has the highest concentration
762000	765000	in all metals.
765000	768000	In addition, it is basically pure metal
768000	771000	and has a relatively small
771000	774000	concentration after oxidation.
774000	777000	In addition,
777000	780000	it is not easy to
780000	783000	keep the fuel in it.
783000	786000	However,
786000	789000	it is very brittle
789000	792000	at low temperature.
792000	795000	It is a bit like ceramic.
795000	798000	Why does this happen?
798000	801000	As you may have heard,
801000	804000	iron becomes brittle
804000	807000	at low temperature.
807000	810000	It does not become brittle
810000	813000	when you hit it.
813000	816000	This is the case
816000	819000	in BCC,
819000	822000	which is also a metal of
822000	825000	high temperature.
825000	828000	In addition,
828000	831000	the temperature may rise to 2,000 degrees
831000	834000	when there is a special situation.
834000	837000	In October,
837000	840000	it is like a solar flare.
840000	843000	It suddenly releases a lot of heat
843000	846000	and the surface becomes
846000	849000	more than 2,000 degrees.
850000	853000	This will cause the mechanical properties
853000	856000	of the material to deteriorate.
856000	859000	In addition,
859000	862000	there will be some
862000	865000	transmutation elements
865000	868000	due to lead oxidation.
868000	871000	This is why
871000	874000	different materials
874000	877000	are developed.
878000	881000	Urethane and
881000	884000	high deformation
884000	887000	materials
887000	890000	have a good feature.
890000	893000	Their DBTT,
893000	896000	which I just talked about,
896000	899000	will become brittle
899000	902000	when it is transformed.
902000	905000	The material that was transformed
905000	908000	will become as brittle as ceramic.
908000	911000	The temperature of transformation
911000	914000	is DBTT.
914000	917000	This is called transformation temperature.
917000	920000	In addition,
920000	923000	they also propose
923000	926000	Particle Reinforced Tonsils,
926000	929000	which contains some
929000	932000	oxidized or oxidized materials
932000	935000	to stabilize the grain boundary.
935000	938000	The heat stability
938000	941000	will be higher.
941000	944000	DBTT is the same.
944000	947000	It will contain some
947000	950000	fake elements
950000	953000	to stabilize the boundary.
953000	956000	It can suppress the phenomenon
956000	959000	of mechanical growth and tightness.
959000	962000	I have a question.
962000	965000	We also do a lot of
965000	968000	neutron scattering experiments.
968000	971000	We do particle physics,
971000	974000	so we care about
974000	977000	the energy of each neutron
977000	980000	more than the total energy
980000	983000	multiplied by its flux.
983000	986000	Do you care about the energy of neutrons
986000	989000	more than the total energy
989000	992000	multiplied by its flux?
992000	995000	We care about both.
995000	998000	I will talk about it later.
998000	1001000	What I am talking about now
1001000	1004000	is the manufacturing process.
1004000	1007000	The material is brittle
1007000	1010000	when it is at room temperature.
1010000	1013000	It is difficult to process.
1013000	1016000	So we use cross-sectional molding
1016000	1019000	and spot plasma sintering
1019000	1022000	to reduce the number of processing.
1022000	1025000	So the final product will be produced.
1025000	1028000	They propose so many
1028000	1031000	different materials
1031000	1034000	but they never do the test.
1034000	1037000	When designing DBTT,
1037000	1040000	you need to consider
1040000	1043000	the strict conditions
1043000	1046000	for the machine to perform well.
1046000	1049000	So they need this kind of data.
1049000	1052000	So my PhD thesis is
1052000	1055000	to assess these
1055000	1058000	high-temperature neutron elation effects.
1058000	1061000	The conditions are
1061000	1064000	the highest temperature is 1200°C
1064000	1067000	based on the operation of the ETH diverter.
1067000	1070000	The ETH diverter's
1070000	1073000	end-of-life
1073000	1076000	which is the highest cumulative mass
1076000	1079000	is less than 1 dPa
1079000	1082000	which is displacement per atom.
1082000	1085000	Displacement per atom
1085000	1088000	is a method to calculate
1088000	1091000	how many times the atom is moved.
1091000	1094000	The higher the number,
1094000	1097000	the higher the displacement per atom.
1097000	1100000	Hello, can I ask a question?
1100000	1103000	Yes, you can.
1103000	1106000	I'm working in nuclear engineering
1106000	1109000	at Utah University.
1109000	1112000	So I've touched a lot of these.
1112000	1115000	So you said the temperature is very high
1115000	1118000	and it has displacement per atom.
1118000	1121000	But if the temperature is high
1121000	1124000	and you heat it up,
1124000	1127000	it will return to its original state.
1127000	1130000	Will it be able to repair itself?
1130000	1133000	It will repair itself.
1133000	1136000	But what I'm trying to say is
1136000	1139000	the calculation
1139000	1142000	because the displacement per atom
1142000	1145000	is not really displacement per atom.
1145000	1148000	It's interstitial or vacancy.
1148000	1151000	So the purpose of the cumulative dPa
1151000	1154000	is to calculate the fluence.
1154000	1157000	Because the neutron source
1157000	1160000	and the iron source
1160000	1163000	and the electron source
1163000	1166000	all have dPa.
1166000	1169000	They all have their own fluence.
1169000	1172000	So the purpose of the dPa
1172000	1175000	is to have a match
1175000	1178000	between the damage and the fluence.
1178000	1181000	It's just a comparison.
1181000	1184000	It's not that the density of the voice
1184000	1187000	will be that high or that low.
1187000	1190000	Because at different temperatures,
1190000	1193000	like what you said,
1193000	1196000	it will have a different effect.
1196000	1199000	Thank you.
1199000	1202000	We have a total of 12 materials
1202000	1205000	that are being studied.
1205000	1208000	One of them is a multi-crystalline material
1208000	1211000	and the other is a single-crystalline material.
1211000	1214000	If the multi-crystalline material
1214000	1217000	is divided by the composition of the material,
1217000	1220000	it will be divided into a pure material
1220000	1223000	or a particle-reinforced material
1223000	1226000	or a non-crystalline material.
1226000	1229000	For the pure material,
1229000	1232000	it's either purchased
1232000	1235000	or provided by different research units.
1235000	1238000	So IGP is made in Australia.
1238000	1241000	ATW is made in China.
1241000	1244000	IGA is made in Japan.
1244000	1247000	Particle-reinforced tungsten
1247000	1250000	contains some things like
1250000	1253000	zirconium carbide or titanium carbide
1253000	1256000	and ethane oxide.
1256000	1259000	For the tungsten alloys,
1259000	1262000	as I mentioned earlier,
1262000	1265000	it contains DOPE and
1265000	1268000	ferric alloy.
1268000	1271000	KR is ferric alloy.
1271000	1274000	If you divide it by the composition,
1274000	1277000	you can also divide it into three categories.
1277000	1280000	There are rolled and forged materials.
1280000	1283000	The advanced process is
1284000	1287000	spark plasma sintering.
1287000	1290000	The last one, recrystallized tungsten,
1290000	1293000	is a reference group.
1293000	1296000	It's to increase the structure of the fiber
1296000	1299000	and let us know more about
1299000	1302000	the impact of the corrosion.
1302000	1305000	If we divide it by the volume,
1305000	1308000	we can divide it into two types.
1308000	1311000	The first one is elongated grains.
1311000	1314000	You can see that
1314000	1317000	only IGP is carrier-like grains
1317000	1320000	because it's double forged.
1320000	1323000	It's broken on both sides.
1323000	1326000	So it's elongated and
1326000	1329000	looks like fiber.
1329000	1332000	The other materials are rolled,
1332000	1335000	so it's flat and pancake-like.
1335000	1338000	It's like a pancake.
1339000	1342000	The remaining four materials,
1342000	1345000	advanced process and recrystallized tungsten,
1345000	1348000	are all equal axis grains.
1348000	1351000	It's not particularly long.
1354000	1357000	The four pieces I use are all
1357000	1360000	metatrized samples.
1360000	1363000	You can see that it's only 12 mm in size.
1363000	1366000	It's about a dollar in size.
1367000	1370000	The elongated grains,
1370000	1373000	the forged and rolled tungsten,
1373000	1376000	are metatrized,
1376000	1379000	so their mechanical properties are ideal.
1379000	1382000	They have different properties in different directions.
1382000	1385000	So we took two directions to analyze.
1385000	1388000	How do we define the direction?
1388000	1391000	It's determined by the position
1391000	1394000	of the material when it breaks
1395000	1398000	If the broken surface is perpendicular
1398000	1401000	to the elongated grain,
1401000	1404000	we say it's an L-sample or LT-sample.
1404000	1407000	If it's parallel to the elongated grain,
1407000	1410000	we say it's a TL-sample.
1412000	1415000	There are four tests
1415000	1418000	applied in our experiment.
1418000	1421000	The first one is fractured tungsten,
1421000	1424000	which has a black line in the middle.
1424000	1427000	We used EDM to cut it
1427000	1430000	in a power-generating way,
1430000	1433000	and we cut out a small hole.
1433000	1436000	This small hole can be used
1436000	1439000	as a crack,
1439000	1442000	and it can be used
1442000	1445000	as a crack hole,
1445000	1448000	and it can be used
1448000	1451000	as a crack hole,
1451000	1454000	so we can test
1454000	1457000	the resistance of the crack hole expansion.
1457000	1460000	In the end,
1460000	1463000	we cut out the fragment.
1463000	1466000	Tensile test is the most common
1466000	1469000	mechanical property.
1469000	1472000	The test is mainly for
1472000	1475000	measuring the force-force curve,
1475000	1478000	compressive strength,
1478000	1481000	elongation strength,
1481000	1484000	and some elongation properties.
1484000	1487000	The third one is
1487000	1490000	3-point bending test.
1490000	1493000	The 3-point bending test
1493000	1496000	mainly tests the bending nature,
1496000	1499000	including bending force and bending hardness.
1499000	1502000	In our experiment,
1502000	1505000	we tested the 3-point bending test.
1505000	1508000	The last one is
1508000	1511000	micro-indentation test.
1511000	1514000	This is a very simple test.
1514000	1517000	I used an indenter
1517000	1520000	to press a crack on the surface of the material
1520000	1523000	to measure its size and hardness.
1523000	1526000	If the indent is small,
1526000	1529000	the hardness will be high.
1529000	1532000	The 3-point bending test
1532000	1535000	is different from the previous ones.
1535000	1538000	Neutron irradiation is
1538000	1541000	done in Fission Reactor 2.
1541000	1544000	As we all know,
1544000	1547000	fusion and fission are very different
1547000	1550000	in the neutron spectrum.
1550000	1553000	Fission has a very high
1553000	1556000	thermoneutron flux.
1557000	1560000	In order to make the spectrum
1560000	1563000	as close to fusion as possible,
1563000	1566000	we need to block
1566000	1569000	the thermoneutrons.
1569000	1572000	We use a steel capsule
1572000	1575000	to cover the sample
1575000	1578000	to block the thermoneutrons.
1578000	1581000	In addition,
1581000	1584000	we put the capsule
1584000	1587000	in the middle of the fuel channel
1587000	1590000	to reduce the thermoneutrons.
1590000	1593000	In addition,
1593000	1596000	we need to perform
1596000	1599000	high-temperature experiments.
1599000	1602000	The high-temperature experiment
1602000	1605000	is because the sample
1605000	1608000	will be gamma-heated in the fusion reactor.
1608000	1611000	The temperature of the sample
1611000	1614000	will be higher
1614000	1617000	if we reduce the thermoneutrons
1617000	1620000	and lower the temperature
1620000	1623000	if we increase the thermoneutrons.
1623000	1626000	We use a spacer pin
1626000	1629000	to control the distance
1629000	1632000	between the sample and the capsule.
1632000	1635000	The shorter the distance,
1635000	1638000	the lower the temperature.
1638000	1641000	Here are the three tests
1641000	1644000	that I developed and improved.
1644000	1647000	The first one is
1647000	1650000	the Fracture Time Detect
1650000	1653000	and the Sturman Bending Test.
1653000	1656000	I combined the two tests
1656000	1659000	because most of the standard tests
1659000	1662000	are aimed at steel.
1662000	1665000	We all know that
1665000	1668000	steel is a high-temperature material.
1668000	1671000	However,
1671000	1674000	we can't test the material
1674000	1677000	directly with the ANC standard.
1677000	1680000	We can't test the material
1680000	1683000	directly with the ANC standard.
1683000	1686000	This is an improvement.
1686000	1689000	You can see that
1689000	1692000	the Fracture Time Detect
1692000	1695000	and the Sturman Bending Test
1695000	1698000	increase with the temperature.
1698000	1701000	When I combine the two curves,
1701000	1704000	you can see that
1704000	1707000	they are basically the same.
1707000	1710000	I can define a DVTT
1710000	1713000	when the Fracture Strength
1713000	1716000	is equal to 5%,
1716000	1719000	the Fracture Toughness
1719000	1722000	is equal to 5%
1722000	1725000	and the Fracture Strength
1725000	1728000	is equal to 5%.
1728000	1731000	This can be used
1731000	1734000	as a DVTT definition.
1734000	1737000	However,
1737000	1740000	you will find that
1740000	1743000	the DVTT can't be used
1743000	1746000	as a DVTT definition.
1746000	1749000	We can use the ANC test
1749000	1752000	to support or even replace
1752000	1755000	the Fracture Time Detect.
1755000	1758000	You can see that
1758000	1761000	the geometry of the sample
1761000	1764000	and the test setup are simpler.
1764000	1767000	It can reduce a lot of costs.
1767000	1770000	I have a question.
1770000	1773000	I can understand that
1774000	1777000	but do you have a goal?
1777000	1780000	For example,
1780000	1783000	what kind of spec do you want to achieve?
1783000	1786000	What do you mean?
1786000	1789000	For example,
1789000	1792000	what kind of data do you want to improve?
1792000	1795000	Do you have a goal
1795000	1798000	to meet the future needs?
1798000	1801000	Our goal is
1801000	1804000	to reduce the number of tests
1804000	1807000	and to reduce the number of samples.
1807000	1810000	When we do this kind of test,
1810000	1813000	the space of the reactor is limited.
1813000	1816000	The number of samples
1816000	1819000	is also limited.
1819000	1822000	Any experiment requires
1822000	1825000	high-intensity protection
1825000	1828000	and a lot of regulations.
1828000	1831000	For example,
1831000	1834000	a tensile sample
1834000	1837000	costs 5,000 euros.
1837000	1840000	So your focus is on
1840000	1843000	developing a way to test.
1843000	1846000	Yes.
1846000	1849000	What kind of value do you want to test?
1849000	1852000	The value I want to test
1852000	1855000	is the same as the standard.
1855000	1858000	I can use it to replace the standard.
1858000	1861000	I see.
1861000	1864000	So you don't do any value-changing?
1864000	1867000	The value-changing part
1867000	1870000	is done by other institutes.
1870000	1873000	I mentioned it just now.
1873000	1876000	I do the final approval.
1876000	1879000	It takes a lot of time to do the final approval.
1879000	1882000	I didn't talk about the time it takes.
1882000	1885000	For example,
1885000	1888000	I have to wait a year
1888000	1891000	for the final approval.
1891000	1894000	After the final approval,
1894000	1897000	you can't do it right away
1897000	1900000	because it's too high-intensity.
1900000	1903000	You have to cool it down
1903000	1906000	for half a year or even 10 months.
1906000	1909000	I don't have half the time
1909000	1912000	I can ask you a question.
1912000	1915000	Your BR2 Reactor.
1915000	1918000	I used the Belgian Reactor
1918000	1921000	as a benchmark.
1921000	1924000	Is this called Venus?
1924000	1927000	Is BR2 Venus?
1927000	1930000	Venus.
1930000	1933000	They used to build a reactor
1933000	1936000	for PWR vessel material testing.
1936000	1939000	They modified it.
1939000	1942000	I don't know if it's called Venus.
1942000	1945000	I've never heard of Venus.
1945000	1948000	Can I ask how much power
1948000	1951000	does your reactor have?
1951000	1954000	1 MW?
1954000	1957000	I don't remember.
1957000	1960000	I think it's 50 MW.
1960000	1963000	I have a suggestion.
1963000	1966000	You used steel for the capsule, right?
1966000	1969000	You want to block the thermoneutron, right?
1969000	1972000	Thermoneutron interaction
1972000	1975000	seems to be better with light material.
1975000	1978000	If the temperature of the reactor
1978000	1981000	is not too high,
1981000	1984000	polyethylene seems to be better.
1984000	1987000	Thermoneutron cross-section
1987000	1990000	is bigger.
1990000	1993000	If you use light elements
1993000	1996000	to block the thermoneutron,
1996000	1999000	will it be easier to produce more thermoneutron?
1999000	2002000	Because you reduce the number of neutrons.
2002000	2005000	So you basically use boron.
2005000	2008000	But boron will affect the reactivity.
2008000	2011000	Yes, so it will be more complicated.
2011000	2014000	They won't let you do that.
2014000	2017000	Thank you.
2020000	2023000	So,
2023000	2026000	based on the conclusion we just made,
2026000	2029000	we can come up with a method
2029000	2032000	similar to the ASTM standard
2032000	2035000	to test the temperature of the steel.
2035000	2038000	So here,
2038000	2041000	we only need one test temperature.
2041000	2044000	So we only need one temperature
2044000	2047000	to do the experiment.
2047000	2050000	We use the three-point slope
2050000	2053000	to get the slope of the curve.
2053000	2056000	Then,
2056000	2059000	we need to make two assumptions.
2059000	2062000	One is 23 MPa square meter,
2062000	2065000	which is the DPA we just defined.
2065000	2068000	The other is Kbase,
2068000	2071000	which is the lowest value of the curve.
2071000	2074000	Why do I use 5 to 10 here?
2074000	2077000	Because 5 to 10 doesn't affect
2077000	2080000	the curve during the transition period.
2080000	2083000	The result is basically the same.
2083000	2086000	So we can deduce the curve.
2086000	2089000	So we can deduce the curve.
2089000	2092000	This is the deduced curve.
2092000	2095000	This is the experiment value.
2095000	2098000	You can see that it is quite consistent.
2098000	2101000	So you can see that IGP,
2101000	2104000	its elasticity is better than ATW,
2104000	2107000	but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.
2107000	2110000	but its dBtt is slightly higher than ATW.
2110000	2113000	The second test method we developed
2113000	2116000	The second test method we developed
2116000	2119000	is the Interrupted Tensile Test.
2119000	2122000	Generally, the tensile test is to pull it all the way,
2122000	2125000	until it breaks.
2125000	2128000	After we get the whole curve,
2128000	2131000	we will see the tensile strength.
2131000	2134000	But we do it differently.
2134000	2137000	We will see the tensile strength
2137000	2140000	when it reaches the tensile strength.
2140000	2143000	So how do we measure the tensile strength?
2143000	2146000	First, we provide a load.
2146000	2149000	You can see the stress goes up.
2149000	2152000	The load rate is the slope of the stress.
2152000	2155000	The load rate is the slope of the stress.
2155000	2158000	When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,
2158000	2161000	we stop the test.
2161000	2164000	we stop the test.
2164000	2167000	We can stop the test
2167000	2170000	at a place close to the tensile strength.
2170000	2173000	at a place close to the tensile strength.
2173000	2176000	At that point,
2176000	2179000	there is no major deformation
2179000	2182000	so it has no effect on its fiber structure.
2182000	2185000	When the load reaches the half of its maximum value,
2185000	2188000	we stop the test
2188000	2191000	at a place close to the tensile strength.
2191000	2194000	At that point,
2194000	2197000	there is no major deformation
2197000	2200000	so it has no effect on its fiber structure.
2200000	2203000	At that point,
2203000	2206000	there is no major deformation
2206000	2209000	so it has no effect on its fiber structure.
2209000	2212000	At that point,
2212000	2215000	we can see that this is a DBT range.
2215000	2218000	we can see that this is a DBT range.
2218000	2221000	The advantage is that we only need one test piece.
2221000	2224000	The advantage is that we only need one test piece.
2224000	2227000	This will save us more time.
2227000	2230000	This will save us more time.
2230000	2233000	You can see that the HMLR
2233000	2236000	is higher than the upper yaw strength.
2236000	2239000	The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.
2239000	2242000	The HMLR is higher than the upper yaw strength.
2242000	2245000	This experiment is very suitable for
2245000	2248000	the materials with the HMLR.
2248000	2251000	The materials with the HMLR.
2251000	2254000	You can see that the HMLR
2254000	2257000	is a drop in the HMLR point.
2257000	2260000	The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.
2260000	2263000	The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.
2293000	2296000	The HMLR is a drop in the HMLR point.
2296000	2299000	You have to be careful to control it,
2299000	2301000	because we don't want it to deform,
2301000	2304000	so you have to be careful to control the drop point.
2304000	2306000	So you have to be careful to control the drop point.
2306000	2309000	The third,
2309000	2310000	the last,
2310000	2312000	one that I introduced and we developed
2312000	2315000	a testing method.
2315000	2317000	This test method is very small.
2317000	2318000	This test method is very small.
2318000	2321000	A little test method.
2321000	2325000	It is an Indian test related to Danjin.
2325000	2328000	As we all know,
2328000	2331000	Danjin has a mechanical phenomenon.
2331000	2333000	In other words, it will have different mechanical reactions
2333000	2336000	in different directions.
2336000	2340000	So when it was doing the Indian test,
2340000	2342000	there was a similar phenomenon.
2342000	2349000	So when I pressed an indent,
2349000	2351000	I moved it to another place,
2351000	2356000	rotated it, and pressed it again.
2356000	2358000	You will find that the four pictures on the right
2358000	2361000	are rotated at 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees respectively.
2361000	2363000	You will see that their shapes are different.
2363000	2368000	When we calculate the hardness,
2368000	2370000	the traditional method is called Diagonal.
2370000	2372000	So it is its diagonal.
2372000	2373000	Because its shape is different,
2373000	2375000	its diagonal is also different.
2375000	2376000	Then the diagonal is different,
2376000	2378000	the hardness you deduced is also different.
2378000	2380000	So there is a fluctuation.
2380000	2384000	What I use here is the True Project Area.
2384000	2385000	It will also be different.
2385000	2387000	The whole black part,
2387000	2390000	I just use this to calculate.
2390000	2392000	Then it will also be different.
2392000	2394000	Why is it different?
2394000	2397000	Because in Danjin,
2397000	2403000	we can use the Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law
2403000	2405000	to explain.
2405000	2407000	The Schwarzschild-Schmidt Law is related to
2407000	2409000	the relationship between the stretching force
2409000	2411000	and the cutting force.
2411000	2414000	It is related to the slip plane of the material.
2414000	2417000	It is related to the sliding system.
2417000	2423000	So if the relative angle of your sliding system
2423000	2425000	changes,
2425000	2426000	your M value will change.
2426000	2427000	If your M value changes,
2427000	2430000	your cutting force will also change.
2430000	2433000	So when your material is deforming,
2433000	2435000	your dislocation glide
2435000	2437000	will also require a different force.
2437000	2443000	So the deformation of the indent
2443000	2446000	you just saw will be different.
2449000	2451000	So we came up with a small
2451000	2454000	suggestion for future experiments.
2454000	2455000	Because basically,
2455000	2457000	there are a lot of people doing low-quantity
2457000	2459000	photocopying experiments,
2459000	2462000	such as 0.0dPa.
2462000	2464000	In this situation,
2464000	2466000	the irradiation hardening
2466000	2472000	is usually quite low.
2472000	2474000	If you don't take this into account,
2474000	2478000	the anisotropic indentation,
2478000	2480000	the hardness,
2480000	2482000	will cause some of your trends
2482000	2484000	to be a little weird,
2484000	2486000	to be disordered.
2486000	2488000	So we came up with this.
2488000	2490000	Because the indent we used
2490000	2492000	as you can see,
2492000	2496000	is a Victor hardness indenter.
2496000	2497000	It has four faces.
2497000	2498000	So basically,
2498000	2500000	the change it produces
2500000	2503000	is a cycle of 90 degrees.
2503000	2505000	So it's a sine function.
2505000	2506000	So the way we propose is that
2506000	2508000	you can do an experiment
2508000	2510000	at three different angles.
2510000	2514000	This is an indentation experiment.
2514000	2515000	Then,
2515000	2517000	by fitting this sine function,
2517000	2519000	you get H0.
2519000	2523000	This is a very accurate value.
2523000	2525000	It's a more uniform value.
2525000	2527000	You can use it to compare
2527000	2529000	the material hardening.
2529000	2531000	If you don't know
2531000	2533000	your crystallography direction,
2533000	2535000	which means you don't know
2535000	2537000	where your energy is coming from,
2537000	2539000	we suggest you use 8%
2539000	2541000	to represent your uncertainty.
2541000	2543000	Because we found that
2543000	2545000	no matter how the radiation temperature changes,
2545000	2547000	basically,
2547000	2551000	the amplitude is about 8%.
2553000	2557000	Here are the unradiated results.
2557000	2560000	So this is the general tensile property.
2560000	2562000	It's the tensile property.
2562000	2565000	As you can see from the right,
2565000	2569000	in the experiment at 400 and 600 degrees,
2569000	2572000	you can see that
2572000	2575000	the Zirconium carbide-reinforced tungsten
2575000	2577000	has the highest strength,
2577000	2580000	which is the brown line.
2580000	2583000	Before that,
2583000	2584000	I'd like to introduce
2584000	2585000	what uniform elongation is,
2585000	2587000	and what early necking is.
2587000	2589000	Uniform elongation is
2589000	2592000	the strength between
2592000	2594000	the yield strength and UTS,
2594000	2596000	which is the tensile strength
2596000	2598000	between the yield strength
2598000	2600000	and the tensile strength.
2601000	2604000	This is the uniform elongation.
2604000	2606000	If there is no uniform elongation,
2606000	2608000	this phenomenon is called early necking.
2608000	2610000	At 500 degrees,
2610000	2612000	which is 400 degrees,
2612000	2613000	you can see that
2613000	2614000	basically all materials
2614000	2616000	have different levels of uniform elongation,
2616000	2618000	except T-orientation,
2618000	2620000	which is the material
2620000	2622000	in the T-direction,
2622000	2624000	and L-orientation.
2624000	2627000	When you raise the temperature to more than 500 degrees,
2627000	2629000	you will find that
2629000	2632000	those with mechanical processing,
2632000	2636000	such as rolling and forging materials,
2636000	2638000	they all become early necking.
2638000	2643000	Their uniform elongation disappears.
2643000	2644000	However,
2644000	2646000	those tungsten with advanced processing
2646000	2649000	still have the phenomenon
2649000	2652000	of uniform elongation.
2652000	2655000	Because of their uniform elongation,
2655000	2658000	their work-hardening capacity is better.
2666000	2668000	Here we also analyze
2668000	2672000	the relative properties of fracture strength.
2672000	2674000	You can see that
2674000	2675000	IGP,
2675000	2677000	we use the machine
2677000	2679000	of fracture strength
2679000	2684000	and fracture strength
2684000	2688000	to evaluate their fracture resistance,
2688000	2690000	which is their toughness.
2690000	2691000	Basically,
2691000	2693000	when you multiply strength and toughness,
2693000	2694000	it is energy.
2694000	2695000	So we can know
2695000	2698000	how much energy
2698000	2700000	the material needs
2700000	2702000	to resist the fracture.
2702000	2703000	You can see that
2703000	2706000	IGP-L needs the highest energy,
2706000	2708000	so its fracture resistance is the highest.
2708000	2709000	In addition,
2709000	2710000	we will find that
2710000	2713000	in different directions,
2713000	2716000	the fracture strength of the same material
2716000	2718000	in different directions
2718000	2719000	is different.
2719000	2722000	You can see that
2722000	2726000	L's fracture strength
2726000	2727000	is higher than T's.
2727000	2729000	Although their waist strength
2729000	2730000	and ultimate waist strength
2730000	2732000	are basically the same material,
2732000	2734000	but their fracture strength is much worse.
2734000	2735000	Why is that?
2735000	2740000	Here is a possible explanation.
2740000	2745000	Because their fracture strength is different.
2745000	2746000	You can see that
2746000	2748000	the fracture strength of L's sample
2748000	2750000	on the right is like this.
2750000	2751000	So if you crack
2751000	2752000	and propagate,
2752000	2755000	the weakest part of the material
2755000	2758000	is the fracture strength.
2758000	2759000	So basically,
2759000	2762000	your fractures like to have fracture strength.
2762000	2764000	When you expand the fracture strength
2764000	2765000	in L's sample,
2765000	2767000	it will usually come across
2767000	2770000	the middle of the fracture strength.
2770000	2771000	Either it deviates
2771000	2772000	or it goes through.
2772000	2773000	When it goes through,
2773000	2774000	the energy needed
2774000	2776000	and the force needed
2776000	2779000	will be higher.
2779000	2782000	So why is L's fracture strength
2782000	2784000	higher than T's?
2784000	2786000	T's fracture strength
2786000	2788000	is basically parallel
2788000	2790000	to the fracture surface.
2790000	2791000	So basically,
2791000	2793000	it just goes through.
2793000	2794000	So it's easier to have
2794000	2796000	premature fracture.
2797000	2799000	On the right,
2799000	2800000	you can see that
2800000	2801000	the triple junction
2801000	2802000	is the junction point
2802000	2804000	of the three meridians.
2804000	2805000	Basically,
2805000	2806000	the force will be concentrated here.
2806000	2807000	You can see that
2807000	2810000	L's sample has more force concentration.
2810000	2811000	That is to say,
2811000	2812000	under the same force,
2812000	2814000	the force they share
2814000	2815000	is smaller.
2815000	2816000	This is why
2816000	2819000	the fracture strength is higher.
2819000	2820000	As for T's,
2820000	2823000	it has less triple junction.
2824000	2825000	This is why
2825000	2827000	it's easier to have
2827000	2832000	premature fracture.
2832000	2833000	So these two points
2833000	2834000	add up to
2834000	2835000	T's fracture strength
2835000	2837000	which is lower than L's.
2841000	2843000	Here, we use 3-point contour
2843000	2845000	to measure DVTT.
2845000	2847000	As I mentioned earlier,
2847000	2848000	we can use it
2848000	2850000	to replace fracture toughness
2850000	2851000	to understand DVTT.
2851000	2853000	We did a test here.
2853000	2854000	We found that
2854000	2856000	L's DVTT
2856000	2859000	is lower than T's.
2859000	2860000	That is to say,
2860000	2861000	L can deform
2861000	2863000	at a lower temperature.
2863000	2864000	However,
2864000	2866000	T can't.
2866000	2868000	Let me remind you that
2868000	2869000	T and TL
2869000	2871000	have the same fracture strength.
2871000	2872000	L and LT are the same.
2872000	2873000	But I use different symbols
2873000	2875000	because T is for
2875000	2876000	8-centimeter fissure
2876000	2877000	and TL is for
2877000	2879000	3-point contour fissure.
2880000	2881000	As you can see,
2881000	2883000	Advanced Tungsten Grade
2883000	2885000	has higher DVTT.
2885000	2887000	As for
2887000	2889000	Heavily Formed Tungsten
2889000	2891000	and Tungsten Alloy,
2891000	2892000	Tungsten Alloy
2892000	2894000	has lower DVTT
2894000	2896000	than 100°C.
2898000	2899000	Why is this the case?
2899000	2901000	Why is Advanced Tungsten Grade
2901000	2904000	has higher DVTT?
2905000	2908000	We found that
2909000	2910000	if you have
2910000	2912000	Raw and Forged Tungsten,
2912000	2913000	their
2913000	2915000	Low Angle Ground Boundary Density
2915000	2916000	is higher.
2916000	2917000	What is Low Angle Ground Boundary?
2917000	2918000	Low Angle Ground Boundary is
2918000	2920000	the boundary between
2920000	2922000	the two
2922000	2924000	less than 15°C.
2924000	2926000	The boundary
2926000	2928000	is Low Angle Ground Boundary.
2928000	2930000	Low Angle Ground Boundary
2930000	2932000	can have
2932000	2934000	dislocation nuclei
2934000	2936000	on top of it.
2937000	2939000	They can generate
2939000	2941000	a new dislocation source.
2941000	2943000	If you have more
2943000	2944000	Low Angle Ground Boundary,
2944000	2946000	you can have more dislocation.
2946000	2948000	I just mentioned that
2948000	2950000	you must have dislocation
2950000	2952000	to have Plasticity Formation.
2952000	2953000	That's what I was talking about
2953000	2954000	when I talked about the
2954000	2955000	single-strand boundary.
2955000	2957000	The more dislocation you have,
2957000	2959000	the more likely you are to have
2959000	2961000	Plasticity Formation at low temperature.
2961000	2963000	That's why
2963000	2965000	these fissures
2965000	2967000	have lower Plasticity Formation.
2967000	2969000	We have analyzed
2969000	2971000	the difference between
2971000	2973000	Fracture Surface and
2973000	2975000	Fissure Pattern.
2975000	2977000	On the left,
2977000	2979000	you can see the IGP,
2979000	2980000	Commercial Tungsten.
2980000	2981000	This is the tungsten
2981000	2983000	purchased by the company.
2983000	2985000	Fracture Pattern
2985000	2987000	is closely related
2987000	2989000	to Fissure Pattern.
2989000	2991000	Its denomination is
2991000	2993000	these small cracks.
2993000	2995000	These cracks
2995000	2997000	appear when the temperature is over 400°C.
2997000	2999000	Why do these cracks
2999000	3001000	look like this?
3001000	3003000	Why do these cracks look like this?
3003000	3005000	We can explain it
3005000	3007000	from the perspective of the crystal.
3007000	3009000	You can see the L-sample,
3009000	3011000	the sample above.
3011000	3013000	You can imagine the crystal
3013000	3015000	protruding from the screen
3015000	3017000	pointing at you.
3017000	3019000	As I mentioned,
3019000	3021000	the Wicked String
3021000	3023000	is the weakest.
3023000	3025000	The cracks like to go that way.
3025000	3027000	You can see the cracks
3027000	3029000	going along the crystal
3029000	3031000	or crossing.
3031000	3033000	The T-Orientation
3033000	3035000	is like this.
3035000	3037000	The crystal
3037000	3039000	is arranged one by one
3039000	3041000	on the screen.
3041000	3043000	It's like when you fold
3043000	3045000	a piece of wood.
3045000	3047000	If you fold it along the fiber,
3047000	3049000	it will look like this.
3049000	3051000	As for the Advanced Tungsten Grade,
3051000	3053000	their crystal is basically
3053000	3055000	in the same axis.
3055000	3057000	The cracks are easily
3057000	3059000	to go along the crystal
3059000	3061000	or cross the crystal.
3061000	3063000	They are extended
3063000	3065000	along the crystal.
3065000	3067000	They are basically
3067000	3069000	many intergranular fractures.
3069000	3071000	There are also partial
3071000	3073000	trans-crystal fractures.
3073000	3075000	Trans-crystal fractures are
3075000	3077000	pointed by the green lens
3077000	3079000	which is the
3079000	3081000	trans-crystal fractures.
3081000	3083000	The trans-crystal fractures
3083000	3085000	show the grain shape.
3085000	3087000	At higher temperatures,
3087000	3089000	we can only see
3089000	3091000	the fine grain
3091000	3093000	which is called FG.
3093000	3095000	There are also dimples
3095000	3097000	which show the cracks.
3099000	3101000	Let's talk about
3101000	3103000	Irradiated Results.
3103000	3105000	As I mentioned,
3105000	3107000	we also applied
3107000	3109000	the Inter-Rodent Tensile Type
3109000	3111000	to Irradiated Tungsten.
3111000	3113000	We can see the results.
3113000	3115000	We have estimated
3115000	3117000	the DVT-T.
3117000	3119000	You can see the two materials
3119000	3121000	of DVT-T.
3121000	3123000	Recoil-Covered Reinforced Tungsten
3123000	3125000	and ATW,
3125000	3127000	which is commercial tungsten.
3127000	3129000	Their DVT-Shift
3129000	3131000	is almost the same,
3131000	3133000	which is 200 to 250 degrees.
3133000	3135000	Why do we have a range here?
3135000	3137000	Although these points
3137000	3139000	have been measured
3139000	3141000	to see if they are irradiated,
3141000	3143000	their large
3143000	3145000	refractive deformation
3145000	3147000	is basically non-existent.
3147000	3149000	They have small refractive deformation,
3149000	3151000	which means that the
3151000	3153000	refractive electric field
3153000	3155000	is directly cut off.
3155000	3157000	As you can see,
3157000	3159000	the transition curve
3159000	3161000	basically has a range.
3161000	3163000	Therefore,
3163000	3165000	there is such a phenomenon.
3165000	3167000	When there is a transition range,
3167000	3169000	the refractive deformation
3169000	3171000	is relatively small.
3171000	3173000	As you can see,
3173000	3175000	the stress increase
3175000	3177000	of the two materials
3177000	3179000	is basically
3179000	3181000	doubled.
3181000	3183000	Here,
3183000	3185000	I did some tests
3185000	3187000	of Frager-Thomas.
3187000	3189000	You can see that
3189000	3191000	Frager-Thomas's
3191000	3193000	refractive deformation
3193000	3195000	increases as the
3195000	3197000	refractive field increases.
3197000	3199000	Here, I tested
3199000	3201000	the temperature at 600 degrees,
3201000	3203000	so all the points are made at 600 degrees.
3203000	3205000	The radiation condition
3205000	3207000	is also at 600 degrees.
3207000	3209000	As you can see,
3209000	3211000	when the
3211000	3213000	DPA of the radiation is getting higher
3213000	3215000	to 0.7,
3215000	3217000	it basically
3217000	3219000	reduces the
3219000	3221000	refractive deformation
3221000	3223000	of the material.
3223000	3225000	In other words,
3225000	3227000	it becomes
3227000	3229000	brittle.
3229000	3231000	It basically becomes very brittle.
3231000	3233000	In addition,
3233000	3235000	we also found that
3235000	3237000	the
3237000	3239000	tungsten of
3239000	3241000	ATW
3241000	3243000	also increases
3243000	3245000	the refractive deformation
3245000	3247000	as the
3247000	3249000	refractive field
3249000	3251000	increases.
3251000	3253000	This can prove
3253000	3255000	that the
3255000	3257000	refractive field
3257000	3259000	also goes
3259000	3261000	directly
3261000	3263000	through the
3263000	3265000	crystal.
3265000	3267000	It's not just
3267000	3269000	the crystal.
3269000	3271000	We also did
3271000	3273000	the Transition Curve Estimation.
3273000	3275000	I just mentioned that
3275000	3277000	the 23 MPa root meter
3277000	3279000	cannot be used.
3279000	3281000	Why?
3281000	3283000	Because it cannot be used,
3283000	3285000	we need two
3285000	3287000	experiment temperatures
3287000	3289000	to do the
3289000	3291000	Transition Curve Estimation.
3291000	3293000	Because we have
3293000	3295000	the reference
3295000	3297000	Frasier-Thompson test,
3297000	3299000	the non-irradiated
3299000	3301000	Frasier-Thompson test
3301000	3303000	uses the Frasier-Thompson test.
3303000	3305000	The K-base is 47,
3305000	3307000	and the rest is calculation.
3307000	3309000	As I mentioned,
3309000	3311000	the 23 MPa
3311000	3313000	root meter cannot be used,
3313000	3315000	so we redefine the DPET
3315000	3317000	as Tf.
3317000	3319000	Tf is the
3319000	3321000	anti-curve point.
3321000	3323000	The curve anti-curve point.
3323000	3325000	As you can see,
3325000	3327000	after the radiation,
3327000	3329000	the
3329000	3331000	Tf
3331000	3333000	drops to
3333000	3335000	23 MPa.
3335000	3337000	Why?
3337000	3339000	Because
3339000	3341000	the Tf
3341000	3343000	drops to
3343000	3345000	23 MPa,
3345000	3347000	and the DPET
3347000	3349000	goes higher.
3349000	3351000	If I use the anti-curve point
3351000	3353000	as the definition,
3353000	3355000	the IGP
3355000	3357000	grows only 20 degrees.
3357000	3359000	If I use the
3359000	3361000	anti-curve point as the
3361000	3363000	definition,
3363000	3365000	the ATW
3365000	3367000	grows 100 degrees.
3367000	3369000	If I use the anti-curve point
3369000	3371000	as the definition,
3371000	3373000	the ATW
3373000	3375000	grows 200 degrees.
3375000	3377000	The last curve,
3377000	3379000	the green curve,
3379000	3381000	is not a good fit.
3381000	3383000	The K-top
3383000	3385000	is too close
3385000	3387000	to the K-base.
3387000	3389000	The fitting is weird.
3389000	3391000	We need
3391000	3393000	a higher temperature
3393000	3395000	for the test,
3395000	3397000	so we can get more
3397000	3399000	experimental points.
3399000	3401000	But as we
3401000	3403000	saw,
3403000	3405000	we can say
3405000	3407000	the point on the right,
3407000	3409000	the 0.7,
3409000	3411000	the DPA
3411000	3413000	is higher than 600 degrees.
3413000	3415000	No,
3415000	3417000	the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.
3417000	3419000	No,
3419000	3421000	the DPETT is higher than 600 degrees.
3421000	3423000	Here,
3423000	3425000	we use the hardness test
3425000	3427000	to evaluate the
3427000	3429000	irradiation harmony,
3429000	3431000	which is the hardness
3431000	3433000	after corrosion.
3433000	3435000	As you can see,
3435000	3437000	the highest change
3437000	3439000	in most materials
3439000	3441000	is in
3441000	3443000	irradiation harmony
3443000	3445000	at 1000 degrees.
3445000	3447000	At higher temperature,
3447000	3449000	as we mentioned,
3449000	3451000	there will be annealing.
3451000	3453000	Many DPETTs are annealed,
3453000	3455000	so the temperature drops.
3455000	3457000	But it's still high,
3457000	3459000	as you can see,
3459000	3461000	it's similar to 600 degrees.
3461000	3463000	We haven't done
3463000	3465000	the TEM yet,
3465000	3467000	but we are doing it.
3467000	3469000	We need to prepare the TEM
3469000	3471000	and use GLOBAL,
3471000	3473000	so we need to do it directly.
3473000	3475000	Many materials
3475000	3477000	have high irradiation harmony,
3477000	3479000	so we are still waiting for it to cool down.
3479000	3481000	We haven't done
3481000	3483000	the TEM yet,
3483000	3485000	but according to the document,
3485000	3487000	at higher temperature,
3487000	3489000	the chance of voice
3489000	3491000	will be higher,
3491000	3493000	the voice density
3493000	3495000	will be higher than
3495000	3497000	the dislocation density.
3497000	3499000	So,
3499000	3501000	these two parts
3501000	3503000	are composed of voice.
3503000	3505000	At 1200 degrees,
3505000	3507000	the voice density will be higher.
3507000	3509000	In addition,
3509000	3511000	the current theory
3511000	3513000	states that
3513000	3515000	the higher the range,
3515000	3517000	the more
3517000	3519000	irradiation-induced defects
3519000	3521000	can be absorbed.
3521000	3523000	So, the higher the range,
3523000	3525000	the lower the irradiation harmony.
3525000	3527000	However,
3527000	3529000	IGP is higher than
3529000	3531000	IGA,
3531000	3533000	even though
3533000	3535000	it has a lower
3535000	3537000	voice density.
3537000	3539000	Here is
3539000	3541000	a possible explanation.
3541000	3543000	IGA and IGP
3543000	3545000	are pure materials.
3545000	3547000	Because
3547000	3549000	of the
3549000	3551000	self-insidious atom,
3551000	3553000	which is a
3553000	3555000	self-insidious atom,
3555000	3557000	it will produce
3557000	3559000	Frenkel pairs,
3559000	3561000	which is a
3561000	3563000	self-insidious atom
3563000	3565000	and a vacuum.
3565000	3567000	The self-insidious atom
3567000	3569000	will form an elliptical structure
3569000	3571000	in the BCC,
3571000	3573000	which has a
3573000	3575000	very low
3575000	3577000	dispersion energy.
3577000	3579000	Therefore,
3579000	3581000	the self-insidious atom
3581000	3583000	can move
3583000	3585000	in 3D.
3585000	3587000	Therefore,
3587000	3589000	the self-insidious atom
3589000	3591000	is more likely to be absorbed by the range
3591000	3593000	and leave a lot of vacuum.
3593000	3595000	After that,
3595000	3597000	the voice
3597000	3599000	is higher than
3599000	3601000	the irradiation harmony.
3601000	3603000	That's why IGA
3603000	3605000	has a higher voice density
3605000	3607000	even though
3607000	3609000	it has a higher range.
3609000	3611000	In addition,
3611000	3613000	we also know that
3613000	3615000	hardness and strength
3615000	3617000	are proportional.
3617000	3619000	Therefore,
3619000	3621000	we try to
3621000	3623000	evaluate
3623000	3625000	the growth of
3625000	3627000	the curve
3627000	3629000	of the waist strength
3629000	3631000	and temperature
3631000	3633000	after irradiation.
3633000	3635000	Here,
3635000	3637000	we can see
3637000	3639000	that the brown line
3639000	3641000	is the fractional strength.
3641000	3643000	If it intersects
3643000	3645000	with the color line,
3645000	3647000	it is basically
3647000	3649000	the dBTT.
3649000	3651000	The dark gray line
3651000	3653000	is the dBTT,
3653000	3655000	which is the position
3655000	3657000	of the rotation temperature.
3657000	3659000	However,
3659000	3661000	all of them are not exposed.
3661000	3663000	Only IGP is exposed.
3663000	3665000	Therefore, we can suggest
3665000	3667000	that IGA has a better
3667000	3669000	resistance to irradiation damage.
3669000	3671000	However,
3671000	3673000	we can see that
3673000	3675000	the strength
3675000	3677000	is doubled.
3677000	3679000	The fractional strength
3679000	3681000	is also doubled.
3681000	3683000	The last point is the broken point.
3683000	3685000	The broken point is also
3685000	3687000	doubled.
3687000	3689000	These brown lines
3689000	3691000	should go up.
3691000	3693000	Therefore,
3693000	3695000	we can't say
3695000	3697000	where the dBTT is.
3697000	3699000	However,
3699000	3701000	we can only say
3701000	3703000	whether the resistance
3703000	3705000	to irradiation is strong or not.
3705000	3707000	We can only say that IGP
3707000	3709000	and Zirconia Carbide Tonsil
3709000	3711000	have a better resistance to irradiation.
3711000	3713000	In addition,
3713000	3715000	all of these hardness tests
3715000	3717000	are done at room temperature.
3717000	3719000	Therefore,
3719000	3721000	some things
3721000	3723000	need to be considered
3723000	3725000	before making
3725000	3727000	the final decision.
3727000	3729000	Therefore,
3729000	3731000	we still need
3731000	3733000	some high-temperature
3733000	3735000	hardness tests
3735000	3737000	to verify.
3737000	3739000	Fortunately,
3739000	3741000	we will soon have
3741000	3743000	a high-temperature
3743000	3745000	hardness test device.
3745000	3747000	We will move it
3747000	3749000	to the control area
3749000	3751000	so that we can verify
3751000	3753000	whether the results
3753000	3755000	are correct or not.
3755000	3757000	Finally,
3757000	3759000	we can see
3759000	3761000	the single crystal tungsten
3761000	3763000	that we used
3763000	3765000	the unbiased hardness
3765000	3767000	to test.
3767000	3769000	As I mentioned earlier,
3769000	3771000	the hardness fluctuates
3771000	3773000	depending on the rotation angle.
3773000	3775000	Therefore,
3775000	3777000	if you don't have H0,
3777000	3779000	you won't be able to figure out
3779000	3781000	the exact temperature.
3781000	3783000	If you use H0,
3783000	3785000	you will find that
3785000	3787000	the highest temperature
3787000	3789000	for hardening
3789000	3791000	is 800°C.
3791000	3793000	800°C is
3793000	3795000	the highest temperature
3795000	3797000	for tungsten welding.
3797000	3799000	After that,
3799000	3801000	annealing occurs
3801000	3803000	and the temperature drops slowly.
3803000	3805000	Finally,
3805000	3807000	I will summarize
3807000	3809000	the irradiation results.
3809000	3811000	You can see that
3811000	3813000	the fractional tungsten test
3813000	3815000	and the internal temperature test
3815000	3817000	are used
3817000	3819000	to evaluate the growth rate
3819000	3821000	of dPtT.
3821000	3823000	You can see that
3823000	3825000	the growth rate of IgP
3825000	3827000	is about 0.1 dPa,
3827000	3829000	which is much lower than AtW.
3829000	3831000	AtW will
3831000	3833000	grow to
3833000	3835000	about 300°C
3835000	3837000	at 1 dPa.
3837000	3839000	At 300°C,
3839000	3841000	the cone covering
3841000	3843000	will grow to about 250°C.
3845000	3847000	I will also summarize
3847000	3849000	the results
3849000	3851000	after hardening.
3851000	3853000	You can see that
3853000	3855000	the results of the tensile test
3855000	3857000	are very similar to
3857000	3859000	the hardness evaluation.
3859000	3861000	The curves I mentioned
3861000	3863000	can be used as a reference.
3863000	3865000	They are basically the same
3865000	3867000	as the tensile test.
3867000	3869000	In addition,
3869000	3871000	AtW and IgP
3871000	3873000	have similar density.
3873000	3875000	You can also see
3875000	3877000	that their hardness
3877000	3879000	is similar.
3879000	3881000	The theory
3881000	3883000	may be correct.
3885000	3887000	In addition,
3887000	3889000	we can also see
3889000	3891000	the hardness
3891000	3893000	of the materials
3893000	3895000	at different temperatures.
3895000	3897000	You can see that
3897000	3899000	most materials
3899000	3901000	decrease at 1200°C,
3901000	3903000	except
3903000	3905000	titanium carbide reinforced tungsten.
3905000	3907000	This is a very special phenomenon.
3907000	3909000	We need to
3909000	3911000	use TEM to study further.
3911000	3913000	Because
3913000	3915000	there is no annealing,
3915000	3917000	the crack does not disappear.
3917000	3919000	It does not become larger
3919000	3921000	or self-expand.
3921000	3923000	It is a very special phenomenon.
3923000	3925000	We need to
3925000	3927000	further
3927000	3929000	analyze it
3929000	3931000	with electromagnetic microscope.
3931000	3933000	In conclusion,
3933000	3935000	this is a very simple
3935000	3937000	take-away note.
3939000	3941000	I have developed
3941000	3943000	three different
3943000	3945000	testing methods.
3945000	3947000	The first one is
3947000	3949000	Miniaturized Sturmanium Test
3949000	3951000	and Fracture Tungsten Test.
3951000	3953000	These tests evaluate
3953000	3955000	the growth rate of
3955000	3957000	DVDT and
3957000	3959000	its curve.
3959000	3961000	Interpolated Tensile Test
3961000	3963000	is a test
3963000	3965000	that can measure
3965000	3967000	the strength of
3967000	3969000	different temperatures
3969000	3971000	with a single test.
3971000	3973000	The last one is
3973000	3975000	Unbiased Hardness Test.
3975000	3977000	With this test,
3977000	3979000	we can get
3979000	3981000	accurate hardness
3981000	3983000	and hardness measurement
3983000	3985000	on a single test.
3985000	3987000	In addition,
3987000	3989000	as I mentioned earlier,
3989000	3991000	we use
3991000	3993000	mechanical testing
3993000	3995000	and observation of
3995000	3997000	fiber structure.
3997000	3999000	We found that
3999000	4001000	the higher the
4001000	4003000	membrane boundary density,
4003000	4005000	the lower the temperature
4005000	4007000	of the material.
4007000	4009000	In addition,
4009000	4011000	we found that
4011000	4013000	although IGP
4013000	4015000	does not have
4015000	4017000	a high density,
4017000	4019000	its hardness
4019000	4021000	is relatively low.
4021000	4023000	Therefore,
4023000	4025000	increasing the density
4025000	4027000	does not necessarily
4027000	4029000	reduce the hardness.
4029000	4031000	This theory may be
4031000	4033000	based on very small
4033000	4035000	nanometers.
4035000	4037000	This theory may be
4037000	4039000	based on very small
4039000	4041000	nanometers.
4041000	4043000	This theory may be
4043000	4045000	based on very small
4045000	4047000	nanometers.
4047000	4049000	Thank you.
4057000	4059000	Thank you.
4061000	4063000	Any questions?
4063000	4065000	Any questions?
4065000	4067000	Any questions?
4067000	4069000	There is a general question.
4069000	4071000	We all know that
4071000	4073000	material is expensive.
4073000	4075000	How much do you need
4075000	4077000	in Fusion Reactor?
4077000	4079000	Will it affect
4079000	4081000	Fusion Reactor?
4081000	4083000	Basically,
4083000	4085000	if you want to
4085000	4087000	use a magnetic field
4087000	4089000	or a laser,
4089000	4091000	you have to spend a lot of electricity.
4091000	4093000	If you want to use wood,
4093000	4095000	what do you think?
4095000	4097000	Because I play Fusion Reactor.
4097000	4099000	I have always been interested in Fusion Reactor.
4099000	4101000	But I don't know much about it.
4101000	4103000	Thank you.
4103000	4105000	What about the material?
4105000	4107000	The material is
4107000	4109000	about 900 tons.
4109000	4111000	The material is about 900 tons.
4111000	4113000	900 tons
4113000	4115000	1 kg of material
4117000	4119000	is not that expensive.
4119000	4121000	It's not that expensive.
4121000	4123000	1 kg of material
4123000	4125000	is less than 100 US dollars.
4127000	4129000	So,
4129000	4131000	most of the
4131000	4133000	experience
4133000	4135000	of
4135000	4137000	Fusion Reactor
4137000	4139000	is based on
4139000	4141000	the experience of
4141000	4143000	Fusion Reactor.
4143000	4145000	The cost of materials
4145000	4147000	is usually the lowest.
4147000	4149000	Compared to the cost of
4149000	4151000	the operation,
4151000	4153000	the cost of materials is the lowest.
4153000	4155000	So,
4155000	4157000	this should not affect
4157000	4159000	the future
4159000	4161000	development of Fusion.
4163000	4165000	Another thing I'm interested in
4165000	4167000	is that the material is basically
4167000	4169000	placed at the bottom
4169000	4171000	of Fusion Reactor.
4175000	4177000	I want to know
4177000	4179000	the activation rate.
4179000	4181000	After activation,
4181000	4183000	what is the radiation
4183000	4185000	of Fusion Reactor?
4185000	4187000	For example, SIVIR.
4187000	4189000	Yes, if we use SIVIR.
4195000	4197000	When it first came out,
4197000	4199000	it was more than 50 mSv.
4201000	4203000	Its activation rate is not that high.
4203000	4205000	Because it only contains
4205000	4207000	Rhinium and Osmium.
4207000	4209000	Basically,
4209000	4211000	the composition is low,
4211000	4213000	but you can't directly
4213000	4215000	contact it.
4215000	4217000	So,
4217000	4219000	it's not as high as
4219000	4221000	Fusion Reactor's
4221000	4223000	radiation.
4223000	4225000	So, 50 mSv per hour?
4225000	4227000	Yes.
4227000	4229000	That's pretty high.
4229000	4231000	Thank you.
4231000	4233000	You're welcome.
4235000	4237000	I have a general question.
4241000	4243000	Can you talk about
4243000	4245000	the next step of this project?
4245000	4247000	I mean the whole plan.
4247000	4249000	Which part are you talking about?
4249000	4251000	Is it Diverter or the entire
4251000	4253000	Ether?
4253000	4255000	What is the next step?
4255000	4257000	So,
4257000	4259000	Ether hopes that
4259000	4261000	the first Ether
4261000	4263000	will be in 2025.
4263000	4265000	But we estimate that
4265000	4267000	it will be in 2027 due to
4267000	4269000	some administrative issues.
4269000	4271000	Some minor issues
4271000	4273000	during installation.
4273000	4275000	So, the actual Ether
4275000	4277000	should be in 2027.
4277000	4279000	After Ether,
4279000	4281000	there will be a
4281000	4283000	Demonstration Reactor
4283000	4285000	in Europe.
4285000	4287000	Demonstration Power Plant.
4287000	4289000	It's called DEMO.
4289000	4291000	They want to test
4291000	4293000	some new concepts
4293000	4295000	with Ether.
4295000	4297000	Like TDM,
4297000	4299000	or Blanket.
4299000	4301000	The power generation
4301000	4303000	depends on Blanket.
4303000	4305000	80% of the terminal
4305000	4307000	will be generated here.
4307000	4309000	As you can see,
4311000	4313000	Helium has only 3.5 MeV,
4313000	4315000	but the terminal has 14 MeV.
4315000	4317000	So, the main energy is in the terminal.
4317000	4319000	Fusion Reactor
4319000	4321000	harnesses
4321000	4323000	the terminal energy.
4323000	4325000	It relies on
4325000	4327000	the interaction between
4327000	4329000	the terminal and the material
4329000	4331000	to transfer the energy to the material.
4331000	4333000	So, Blanket will absorb the energy
4333000	4335000	and generate electricity.
4335000	4337000	In addition,
4337000	4339000	in Blanket,
4339000	4341000	you need
4341000	4343000	Deuterium and Trillium.
4343000	4345000	The terminal and the terminal
4345000	4347000	do not exist in the natural world.
4347000	4349000	So, you need to manufacture them.
4349000	4351000	We have the terminal
4351000	4353000	in the Fusion Reactor,
4353000	4355000	and we use it.
4355000	4357000	But we can't always
4357000	4359000	use the fusion reactor
4359000	4361000	to generate the terminal.
4361000	4363000	So, the concept of Ether
4363000	4365000	is to
4365000	4367000	generate the terminal by itself.
4367000	4369000	So, it contains a lot of Li.
4369000	4371000	Li generates the terminal
4371000	4373000	with the fusion reactor.
4373000	4375000	Then, it uses the cycle
4375000	4377000	to extract the terminal
4377000	4379000	and turn it into
4379000	4381000	the fuel to burn.
4381000	4383000	So,
4383000	4385000	this concept
4385000	4387000	will be verified in Ether.
4387000	4389000	Some new concepts
4389000	4391000	in Diverter
4391000	4393000	such as Liquid Metal,
4393000	4395000	can be used to
4395000	4397000	generate the terminal.
4397000	4399000	However,
4399000	4401000	Liquid Metal
4401000	4403000	does not have this problem.
4403000	4405000	So, many new concepts
4405000	4407000	have appeared.
4407000	4409000	I hope that
4409000	4411000	it will be applied to DEMO.
4411000	4413000	The goal of DEMO
4413000	4415000	is that the value of Q is greater than 10.
4415000	4417000	Q is equal to 10.
4417000	4419000	So,
4419000	4421000	the energy generated
4421000	4423000	by the fusion reactor
4423000	4425000	is equal to
4425000	4427000	10 times of the input energy.
4427000	4429000	However,
4429000	4431000	this is a very ambitious goal.
4431000	4433000	Because there is no fusion reactor
4433000	4435000	that has reached
4435000	4437000	this level.
4437000	4439000	Even JET has not reached this level.
4439000	4441000	It seems that
4441000	4443000	there is a theoretical value of 1.
4443000	4445000	But it has not reached this level.
4445000	4447000	So,
4447000	4449000	the goal of DEMO
4449000	4451000	is greater than
4451000	4453000	50.
4453000	4455000	The goal is to reach the state
4455000	4457000	where electricity can be generated.
4457000	4459000	So,
4459000	4461000	this is a European project.
4461000	4463000	However, there are also projects in other countries.
4463000	4465000	Ether is an international project.
4465000	4467000	There are seven countries participating.
4467000	4469000	If the EU is a country,
4469000	4471000	there are
4471000	4473000	EU,
4473000	4475000	China, India,
4475000	4477000	Japan,
4477000	4479000	the United States,
4479000	4481000	and South Korea.
4481000	4483000	Each country has its own DEMO.
4483000	4485000	So, there will be
4485000	4487000	different approaches
4487000	4489000	in the future.
4489000	4491000	However,
4491000	4493000	this is a bit of
4493000	4495000	imagination.
4495000	4497000	Although we have many meetings
4497000	4499000	that are already designing DEMO,
4499000	4501000	I dare not say that
4501000	4503000	Ether has not been built yet.
4505000	4507000	Thank you.
4507000	4509000	It sounds like the next
4509000	4511000	collider of LHC.
4511000	4513000	LHC can't finish it.
4513000	4515000	But they are already discussing
4515000	4517000	how to build the next one.
4517000	4519000	I know the timeline.
4519000	4521000	Thank you.
4521000	4523000	Any other questions?
4529000	4531000	I have a question.
4531000	4533000	Do you have a contact?
4533000	4535000	Or you can email me.
4535000	4537000	Yes, I do.
4537000	4539000	It depends on you.
4539000	4541000	If our audience
4541000	4543000	are interested in
4543000	4545000	the next project,
4545000	4547000	you can contact
4547000	4549000	our speaker.
4549000	4551000	If you want to
4551000	4553000	review this video,
4553000	4555000	we will upload the recording
4555000	4557000	in a week.
4557000	4559000	That's all for today.
4559000	4561000	Let's give our speaker
4561000	4563000	a round of applause.
