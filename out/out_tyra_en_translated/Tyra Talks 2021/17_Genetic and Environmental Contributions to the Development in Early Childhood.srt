1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to share my screen first.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You can share your screen at the same time, no problem.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, cool.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are really happy to have Yichi as our speaker today.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yichi Hong is currently a second-year PhD student at Boston University.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Coincidentally, she studied psychology at Taiwan University.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She studied psychology at Taiwan University.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She has worked in two different research institutes.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
One is a research institute run by Dr. Reagan Lin.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The other is a research institute run by Dr. Wu Wen-Chi.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She mainly studies behavioral coding and research methods related to FMRI.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yichi is amazing.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She graduated three years in advance.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
After graduation, she became a research assistant for two years.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, she has applied to Boston University for research.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Her research focuses on the characteristics of adult anti-social behavior that can be observed in childhood.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Today, we will hear some research related to FMRI, behavioral inheritance, and so on.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I will introduce Yichi to you.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's give Yichi the floor.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Welcome, Yichi.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please start.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you for the introduction.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Behavioral inheritance is a difficult topic.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will not talk about the research related to FMRI today.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will start.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am Yichi Hong.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My research focuses on the development of children before puberty.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can estimate the impact of genes and the environment on behavior.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In a group, we can see the difference in individual behavior.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How many percentages can be explained by genes or the environment?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will talk about behavioral inheritance and how to do it.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will talk about the assumption and basic model of FMRI.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We did not control or manipulate any of the changes.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We did not secretly send twins to different families.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We did not secretly send twins to different families.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Behavioral inheritance aims to answer a big question in psychology or philosophy.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The question is whether human behavior is decided by God or God.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Plato and Aristotle had different opinions on this question.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Plato thought that human behavior was decided by God.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Everyone was born with different abilities.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Aristotle thought that human behavior was created by God.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Everyone was born with a white paper.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The structure of society or education is the most important factor in our behavior.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We also saw this in the time of Simon.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We also saw this in the time of Simon.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Testamentians felt that human beings should have some talents.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They felt that human beings should have some talents.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's Universalism.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But what is the current psychology on these issues?

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But what is the current psychology on these issues?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have been walking along a middle path quite sufficiently.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We felt that genes and environment

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We felt that genes and environment

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and others are responsible for human behavior.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,880
We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,000
We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Through personalities in different religions

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
through personalities in different religions

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,040
we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Human is a sediment different environment

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,200
There are some unfavorable examples that we find on sexual environment,

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
The first thing is family study

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
people in Taiwan has monogamy books

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
We have now standardized this information

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
We have now standardized this information

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
we have now standardized this information

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
family study looks like

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
family study looks like

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Although it is shown by numbers

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
The ratio of genes divided by family is high

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,700
Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
the environment of each generation will be different

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
the environment of each generation will be different

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
The information on different generations, as mentioned before, varies from generation to generation

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
However, DNA definition should only be applied in children

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
However, DNA definition should only be applied in children

90
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,620
The ideal condition is to find тур

91
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,620
The task of double third-party studies is a good source of the teacher

92
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,140
the task of double third-party studies is a good source of the feeder

93
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,140
they are born almost the same time

94
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
you can see the picture

95
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
They are the same sex

96
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
they are the same sex

97
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
genes are 100% connected

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
10% of twins, mother and childω

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
10% of twins, mother and childω

100
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,920
10% of twins, mother and childω

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
10% of twins, mother and childω

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
10% of twins, mother and childω

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
they often havesoft egg

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
they often have soft egg

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
they can be more close in relationship

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
they can be more close in relationship

107
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
they can be more close in relationship

108
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
when they share the 100%

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,860
thus 50%

110
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,060
he can then estimate the influence with document

111
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
thus 50%

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
hence 50%

113
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,920
and the impact will be still small

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
that is a limitation of the research

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,900
even they have good genetic analysis

116
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,260
but it is hard to control the enviornment

117
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,900
then collectively

118
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
the research of pig breeding

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
has better analysis of the envientos

120
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,280
as you can see in this diagram

121
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,780
the research of children breeding

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,760
and the parents who breed

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,900
the similarities between them

124
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,860
can be explain in Template 0

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
can be explain in Template 0

126
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,480
they share the enviornment

127
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,180
the relationship between childrens and parents

128
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,580
the relationship between children and parents

129
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,160
that is related with their genes

130
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,280
but the influence of the same generation

131
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,640
can be seen in the design of the research

132
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,560
so the most perfect state

133
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,200
should be when we study the twins who are adopted

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,240
but the limitation of the research

135
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,160
is that it is hard to collect such data

136
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
the database I know in the world

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
should be one in Sweden

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
and one in Minnesota

139
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,360
so the limitation is that it is hard to collect the data

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,040
the above is the method of measurement

141
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,800
that is we can't directly see

142
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,880
which DNA

143
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
has influence on the behavior

144
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,480
but with the development of biotechnology

145
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,920
we can directly see the information in DNA

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,240
but I am not familiar with this

147
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,920
so I will simply divide it into

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
theoretical and atheoretical

149
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,080
to introduce to you

150
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,360
the former is like

151
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,480
candidate genes

152
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
for example

153
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,640
today I want to see the behavior of adulteration

154
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
then I will study

155
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
the genes related to the多巴胺

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,600
because we know that

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
the rejuvenation mechanism and adulteration

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,600
are closely related

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,640
so we will first select some genes

160
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,720
then put the focus on these genes

161
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,480
to see the variances of these genes

162
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,960
and the variances of the behavior

163
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,880
are they related

164
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
but now this method

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,640
is a little bit

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,360
unknown

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,080
because

168
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,800
human behavior

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
doesn't look like

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,360
there is a small part of genes

171
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,120
and then there is a huge amount of effect

172
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,480
to explain those behaviors

173
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,000
but

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
more like there are many many genes

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
and then their effect is very small

176
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,960
and then pile up

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,240
so

178
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
through the method of candidate genes

179
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
we can currently

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
explain

181
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,480
the behavior variation is about 1% to 5%

182
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,280
that kind of variation

183
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,400
and we use the previous

184
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,160
mentioned

185
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
quantitative behavioral genetics

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,040
to get the

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
estimate value

188
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
there is a big gap

189
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
so later

190
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,200
molecular biologists

191
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
or molecular bio-hereditary behaviorists

192
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,000
they use a more violent method

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
that is not to assume

194
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
and then go to GWAS

195
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,640
directly analyze all the DNA sequences

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
that can see a lot of nucleotides

197
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,720
that is

198
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
the ACTG in DNA

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,840
these sequences

200
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,760
and then we will go to see

201
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,320
these nucleotides

202
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,440
we will go through their

203
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
variance

204
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,040
and then go to some numbers

205
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
and then stack it up

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
and then go to see this

207
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,760
number

208
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
is it related to the behavior we are interested in

209
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
that this is the current

210
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,520
method of molecular bio-hereditary behavior

211
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,400
but the difficulties encountered

212
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,880
is that there are quite a few

213
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,680
that is, it takes about a few million

214
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,360
to be able to

215
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,280
estimate some more effective results

216
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,200
that

217
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,680
another question

218
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
is

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,080
just talked about

220
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,800
they are through

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
the effect of nucleotides

222
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
stacked up

223
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,640
so

224
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
this paper

225
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,160
they are looking at

226
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,040
intelligence

227
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,920
is intelligence

228
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,440
this

229
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,720
feature

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,200
that

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
assume that

232
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,040
the variance between the groups

233
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,080
is 100%

234
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
and then go through

235
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,360
nucleotides

236
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,400
to estimate out of the value

237
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,200
is probably

238
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,160
genes can probably explain

239
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,200
50% of the mutations

240
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
but by stacking this method

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,160
we can calculate

242
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,800
it can explain

243
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
about only 25%

244
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,600
that

245
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
the difference in the middle

246
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,200
represents what

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,680
it means

248
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
these genes may not be

249
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
a linear effect that can be stacked up

250
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,360
but

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
they will be related

252
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
or interaction

253
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,960
and so on

254
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,360
so

255
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
how to calculate

256
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
those genome score

257
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,240
that is

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,120
the direction of future efforts

259
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,120
yes

260
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
the above is a brief introduction

261
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,640
I want to stop

262
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
to see if you have any questions

263
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,760
and then

264
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,400
if you have any questions

265
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,080
you can directly turn on the microphone

266
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,760
then welcome everyone

267
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
directly turn on the microphone

268
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,800
to ask questions

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,120
or if everyone

270
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,000
is

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
you can also use chat

272
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,080
that I can

273
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,680
is to help you

274
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,480
help you with the speaker

275
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,640
is to ask

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,080
the other

277
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,920
if you have any questions

278
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,640
also welcome everyone

279
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,200
is a little

280
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,720
one sentence

281
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
can simply introduce yourself

282
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,680
you can get to know each other

283
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,160
thank you

284
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
that if there is no problem

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,960
is here

286
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
want to emphasize

287
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,400
is that every method

288
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,640
of some restrictions

289
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,320
but did not have

290
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
a perfect research design

291
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
so behavioral genetics

292
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,000
can be integrated through different methods

293
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
and then go to see a

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,800
more stable

295
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
can be found

296
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,080
trend

297
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,560
like this

298
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,040
then we look at

299
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
behavioral genetics

300
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,600
I will be here

301
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
with the example of biopsy research

302
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,400
that he

303
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,640
in the end

304
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,320
how to study

305
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
the impact of genes and the environment

306
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
on the concept

307
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,440
is the same

308
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
we look at

309
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
the relationship between individual genes

310
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
with the relationship on the behavior

311
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,160
that if this relationship

312
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
is significant, then

313
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,080
we will say

314
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,920
genes for us

315
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
are interested in this behavior

316
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,520
has a certain degree of impact

317
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,080
and then we

318
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,400
here to measure a biological term

319
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
called heritability

320
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,160
it refers to

321
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
how many degrees

322
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,080
in the observed behavioral mutation

323
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
can be explained by genes

324
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,240
but because this is a method of measurement

325
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,880
so specific

326
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,720
in the end what is the gene

327
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,880
we have no way to know

328
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
that part of the environment

329
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
we can further

330
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,080
divide into shared

331
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,720
and non-shared environment

332
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,640
that first talk about

333
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,720
the shared environment

334
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
it refers to the environment

335
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,960
those individuals

336
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
they experience the same factors

337
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
and these factors

338
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,120
will make the individual

339
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
for example, like

340
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,480
twins

341
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,560
their social status in the family

342
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,480
living in the community

343
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,440
or culture, etc.

344
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,880
on the other hand,

345
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
non-shared environment

346
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,600
as the name implies

347
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
is the environment

348
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,320
each individual

349
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,840
unique experience

350
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
and these unique experiences

351
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,640
in theory

352
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
will cause differences between individuals

353
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,560
such as

354
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,600
accidents

355
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,720
or miscalculations, etc.

356
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,640
so just like today

357
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,360
a pair of twins

358
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,040
if there is a person

359
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
with COVID

360
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,480
cough

361
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
the other person does not

362
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,560
then they sleep in different rooms

363
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,360
one person will be sick

364
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,320
one person will not

365
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,120
so although they are

366
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
twins

367
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
but their life experience

368
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,480
will not be exactly the same

369
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
or say

370
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
they are in the uterus

371
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
the position of the left bed is different

372
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
maybe one is above

373
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,800
one is below

374
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,520
so

375
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
the difference in the environment

376
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
will not be born to them

377
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,120
early birth

378
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
that physical development

379
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
is there any impact

380
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,400
that

381
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
this is also possible to cause

382
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,080
different factors

383
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,440
of same-egg twins

384
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,480
specifically

385
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,040
how do we calculate it

386
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,000
is that we are through

387
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,080
the similarity between individual

388
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
and behavior

389
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,160
that is to collect some

390
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,280
correlation

391
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,040
so we will collect

392
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
their behavioral data

393
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,680
and then in the model

394
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,160
we will have

395
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,840
twin 1 and twin 2

396
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,600
in this order

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,320
we will try to

398
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
we will randomize

399
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
to reduce some errors

400
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,760
ok

401
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
and then in the model

402
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
we will put three factors

403
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
that is

404
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,040
gene

405
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,360
and then the shared environment

406
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
and the non-shared environment

407
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,520
and then we will try

408
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
to use these three factors

409
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,120
to predict

410
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
their behavioral mutations

411
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,360
like this

412
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,520
ok

413
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,120
that

414
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
part of the parameters

415
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
is our assumption

416
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:50,920
ok

417
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
then we start from the gene

418
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
for same-egg twins

419
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,720
that is

420
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
monozygotic twins

421
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,240
so they are mz

422
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
that because they share

423
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
100% of the gene

424
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
so we will

425
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
put the correlation here

426
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,960
is 1

427
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,800
assume

428
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,120
the two genes

429
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,560
um

430
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,160
the impression

431
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,360
is exactly the same

432
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,720
ok

433
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,160
what about monozygotic twins

434
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,600
that is

435
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,840
dizygotic twins

436
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,200
they share

437
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,040
50% of the gene on average

438
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,200
oh

439
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,240
the gene here refers to

440
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,480
the 1.3% gene unique to humans

441
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,200
because we share with

442
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,280
black stars

443
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
98.7%

444
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,240
ok

445
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,720
so

446
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,120
that is

447
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
for monozygotic twins

448
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
this factor

449
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,040
we will put 0.5

450
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,440
as

451
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,240
the parameter in our model

452
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,920
ok

453
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,320
that

454
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
shared environment

455
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
because they will all

456
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,880
grow up in the same family

457
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,360
so

458
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,920
for

459
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,120
same-egg and monozygotic twins

460
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,800
we assume

461
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
this shared environment

462
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,320
has the same impact on them

463
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
so we will

464
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
put 1

465
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,120
as their correlation

466
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,680
and

467
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,160
in addition

468
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,840
in the non-shared environment

469
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,240
there is no assumption

470
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,880
because

471
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,160
um

472
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
for each individual

473
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,480
logically

474
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
it is unique

475
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,800
so we will

476
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
make it an independent event

477
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,200
and

478
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
put it here

479
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,960
if you have studied

480
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
psychology-related courses

481
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,320
you may have a little impression

482
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,080
formula

483
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,560
so

484
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
we just talked about

485
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,920
our analysis

486
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,360
is to analyze

487
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,080
the correlation between twins

488
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
so we will say

489
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,520
that

490
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,440
usually the correlation between twins

491
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,920
cause

492
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,880
the reason for this correlation

493
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,360
is because

494
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
they have 100%

495
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,160
the same genes

496
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,800
and 100%

497
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,080
the same environment

498
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,320
so

499
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,040
the correlation between

500
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
the same-egg and monozygotic twins

501
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
will be

502
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
half of the same genes

503
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
plus

504
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,440
their

505
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,960
100%

506
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
the same environment

507
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,840
to explain

508
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,160
and

509
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,840
it should be quite obvious

510
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,520
that

511
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:19,840
for

512
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
the prediction of the non-shared environment

513
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
we will

514
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,040
subtract the correlation between

515
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
the same-egg and monozygotic twins

516
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,600
by 1

517
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,960
so

518
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,280
next

519
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
I want to share

520
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,520
this paper

521
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,880
um

522
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
this paper

523
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,800
is written by

524
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,040
Robin Pullman

525
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,320
and

526
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,920
he should be

527
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,960
the most famous

528
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,120
behavioral geneticist

529
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,600
at least

530
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,240
in psychology

531
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,200
it's like this

532
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,400
so

533
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,120
if you are interested

534
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,000
you can look it up

535
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,040
he listed 10 points

536
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,640
that can be stabilized

537
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,320
by replicating

538
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,840
some

539
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,600
results

540
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:44,800
so

541
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,080
I will talk about two

542
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,480
um

543
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,160
the first one

544
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,320
I want you to guess

545
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
how much of human intelligence

546
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,800
can be determined by genes

547
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,520
and

548
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:53,800
um

549
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
in the process of growth

550
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
the part that genes can explain

551
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,800
will change over time

552
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,680
or less

553
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,080
and

554
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,720
I'll give you

555
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,480
10 seconds

556
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,640
to guess

557
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,520
in your heart

558
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,480
ok

559
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,760
so

560
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,000
um

561
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,680
this result

562
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,200
is a

563
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
meta-analysis

564
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,560
so

565
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,160
they

566
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,000
compared

567
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,400
in

568
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,080
childhood

569
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,800
adolescence

570
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,200
and

571
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,960
early adulthood

572
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,600
and

573
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,160
um

574
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,960
behavioral genetics

575
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,600
they saw

576
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,320
how much of the genes

577
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,800
can explain

578
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
the proportion of intelligence

579
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,000
and

580
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
what they found

581
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,600
is that

582
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,800
in childhood

583
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,200
um

584
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,160
genes can explain

585
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
about 40% of the changes

586
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,160
but

587
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,080
in adulthood

588
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,000
genes can explain

589
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
up to 70%

590
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,760
and

591
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,360
we see

592
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,600
in the

593
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,360
early childhood

594
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,080
we can see

595
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,400
that

596
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,760
um

597
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,200
the genes

598
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,760
can explain

599
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,200
about

600
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
50% of the changes

601
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,560
and

602
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,160
in the

603
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,720
early adulthood

604
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
we see

605
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
the effect of sharing the environment

606
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,360
is less

607
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,560
yes

608
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,240
I don't know if this is

609
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,360
a surprising discovery

610
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,960
because

611
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
maybe someone will think

612
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,720
after we are born

613
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,320
we are constantly

614
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
disturbed by the environment

615
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,120
and

616
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,680
the environment

617
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,080
may have a

618
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,520
positive effect on our body

619
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:50,840
but

620
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,640
at least in intelligence

621
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,280
we see

622
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,560
a

623
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,880
opposite result

624
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,240
um

625
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,720
so

626
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:54,960
um

627
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,760
how did behavioral genetics

628
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,440
explain

629
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,680
this phenomenon

630
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,280
we think

631
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,760
it's because

632
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,480
as a person

633
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,040
develops

634
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,160
he has a better

635
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,400
control of his environment

636
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,280
so

637
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,560
yes

638
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,160
how does a person

639
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
decide his environment

640
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
most of the time

641
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,720
we will choose

642
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,280
those that meet

643
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,960
our

644
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
conditions

645
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,720
we feel comfortable

646
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,960
we stay there

647
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,680
so

648
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,280
it should be through this logic

649
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,480
but

650
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,160
you can imagine

651
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,960
when you were a child

652
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,560
a lot of things

653
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,280
are decided by parents

654
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,600
and

655
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,160
after growing up

656
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,720
we can

657
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
control more and more

658
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,040
details in our lives

659
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,480
like

660
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,160
we are not

661
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
after growing up

662
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,280
more and more

663
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,960
indecisive

664
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,120
but

665
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,880
we won't

666
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
let things we don't like

667
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,520
appear on

668
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
our table

669
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,680
yes

670
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,200
oh

671
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,560
what about

672
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
the second study

673
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,640
they looked at

674
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,280
the negative attitude of

675
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,960
teenagers' antisocial behavior and mothers

676
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,080
they studied

677
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,560
teenagers' twins

678
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,720
so

679
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,760
teenagers' mothers

680
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,240
are like

681
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,600
an environmental factor

682
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,520
so

683
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
what did they find

684
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,480
they found

685
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,720
ok

686
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,000
the negative attitude of mothers

687
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,880
sounds like

688
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,400
a shared environmental factor

689
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,680
but

690
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,440
when they ran

691
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,200
that model

692
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,080
they found

693
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,760
genes

694
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,520
shared environment

695
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
and non-shared environment

696
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,040
can significantly explain

697
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,000
the relationship between these two concepts

698
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,640
so

699
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,800
there are a few

700
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
interesting

701
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:04,960
results

702
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,920
we can discuss

703
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,320
like

704
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,960
the first one

705
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,520
we found

706
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
individuals in the environment

707
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,040
are not

708
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,640
passively affected by the environment

709
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,000
but

710
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,640
those seem to be environmental factors

711
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,320
to some extent

712
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,040
reflect some of their

713
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,320
genetic characteristics

714
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,080
you can imagine

715
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,000
when interacting with people

716
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,840
we are not

717
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,920
interacting with them

718
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
in the same way

719
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,240
like

720
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040
if you meet someone

721
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,280
who smiles more often today

722
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
you will

723
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,400
respond

724
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
smile more often

725
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,600
so I think

726
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,280
this result is quite interesting

727
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,680
like

728
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,080
some of the conditions of parents

729
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,760
are often thought to be

730
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
a shared environment

731
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,120
but

732
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,680
they may also be

733
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,120
affected by the genes of their children

734
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,440
so

735
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,080
parents may

736
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,600
interact with their children

737
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,680
in the same way

738
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,400
it is a bit like

739
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,480
the parent-to-parent relationship

740
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,960
shared by the high-level intelligence

741
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,480
maybe

742
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,280
the parents have too high requirements

743
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,440
so

744
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,760
I think

745
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,240
this result

746
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
can comfort some parents

747
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,360
like

748
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,560
oh

749
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,120
no

750
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,880
like

751
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,720
you may do something

752
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
and the child will not respond

753
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
or

754
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
what you do

755
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
is because the child

756
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
makes you do this

757
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,840
and so on

758
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,520
then

759
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
some environmental factors of parents

760
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,760
such as

761
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,920
this negative attitude

762
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,560
it can also

763
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,600
cause individual differences

764
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,960
if everyone has brothers and sisters

765
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,880
it may be easier to imagine

766
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,080
that

767
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,560
there will always be

768
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
when parents are biased

769
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,840
although

770
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,400
this mother

771
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,360
may have a negative attitude

772
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,880
is higher than average

773
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,040
but

774
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,880
her negative attitude

775
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,560
may only target a certain child

776
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:20,880
so

777
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
such a relationship

778
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
will cause

779
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,120
differences between individuals

780
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:26,800
yes

781
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,040
so

782
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,080
let's stop here

783
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,280
do you have any questions?

784
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,920
hello

785
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,040
I would like to ask

786
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
my name is Shi Qinghua

787
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,080
Shi Toushi

788
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,800
Tsinghua University

789
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,680
I would like to ask

790
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,640
about

791
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800
the paper

792
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,440
on self-discipline

793
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
about self-discipline

794
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,960
their explanation is that

795
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,640
after adulthood

796
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,280
it is better to master the environment

797
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,960
then

798
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
such a component

799
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,120
if like us

800
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,040
international students

801
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,920
will there be any changes

802
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,840
did they discuss it?

803
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,080
because we are

804
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,600
in an environment

805
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
that we are not familiar with

806
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
and do not have a good grasp of

807
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,120
oh

808
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,840
understand

809
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,240
but I think

810
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,360
their paper on self-discipline

811
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
may be more like

812
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,440
the kind of self-discipline

813
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,920
that will not be affected by language

814
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,120
so

815
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,800
I was thinking

816
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,720
that

817
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
the part about international students

818
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
is that

819
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,600
the way of measuring

820
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,920
will it be more unfavorable for us

821
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,360
this kind of miscalculation?

822
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,040
not entirely

823
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,360
because like us

824
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,480
to a new environment

825
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,920
especially

826
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,520
when it is a very unfamiliar environment

827
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,200
many times

828
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
our performance

829
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
is actually

830
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,680
likely to be

831
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,160
worse at the beginning

832
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,520
of course

833
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,280
it is also

834
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
more in line with what they said

835
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,360
because we are in an environment

836
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
after getting used to

837
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
will perform better

838
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,280
but we

839
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,040
in fact, I just want to say

840
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,560
that we will not

841
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,280
because of the environment

842
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,080
to become a little stupid

843
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,120
like this

844
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,080
I think it will

845
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
there is a

846
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,480
more related

847
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,960
but they are

848
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,840
discussing the social economic status

849
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,040
is the parents

850
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,840
is the family

851
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
those social status

852
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,640
and so on

853
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,960
and then they found

854
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,360
that there is an interaction

855
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,680
that is

856
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,280
if you are

857
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,680
social economic status

858
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
family resources more

859
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,400
your genes can be better

860
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,560
but if your resources

861
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,280
less

862
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,640
most of the environment is oppressive

863
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,440
and then the environment

864
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,080
to explain

865
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,440
you that

866
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,000
the bad performance of the intelligence

867
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,400
yes

868
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,840
understand

869
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,600
thank you

870
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
hope to answer the question

871
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,600
but they do

872
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
is the social economic status

873
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,480
but I think

874
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,000
that is

875
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,880
discussing

876
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
that

877
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
the whole environmental change

878
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
is also quite interesting

879
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,480
Hi

880
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,520
I have a question

881
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,920
Hi

882
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,160
Hi

883
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,560
I am

884
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,320
my name is Qiao En

885
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,280
I want to follow

886
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,000
just that

887
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,160
the question of Tsinghua

888
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,680
want to ask is that

889
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
that

890
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,120
is because

891
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,920
after a long time

892
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,680
you see it

893
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
seems

894
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,600
the amount of gene explanation is rising

895
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,120
that

896
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,880
this means that

897
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,560
it will come to us

898
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,160
when we are adults

899
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,800
we choose

900
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,240
to have

901
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,720
should be like this

902
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,920
oh

903
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,480
I have to ask the question

904
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,240
should say that

905
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
how is it

906
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,600
the real state

907
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,360
is that after we are adults

908
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,520
see that

909
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,040
the performance

910
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
is in line with

911
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,480
the real gene explanation

912
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,560
or our childhood

913
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,440
that is

914
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,480
I think this question

915
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,200
is very interesting

916
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,520
I personally will be more inclined

917
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,120
I think

918
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,880
during adulthood

919
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,600
we really have

920
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
complete autonomy

921
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,440
measured things

922
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,320
is true

923
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,840
but I think it

924
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
behind the reaction is quite a lot

925
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,080
is that you want to see

926
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,880
development

927
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
is the concept of the human development process

928
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,160
I am more inclined

929
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,640
to adulthood

930
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,400
this result

931
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,400
is good

932
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,320
thank you

933
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,920
I also think so

934
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,080
I just want to know

935
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,120
what do you think

936
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,560
thank you

937
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,680
that means

938
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,000
there is a question here

939
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
Gao Xian, do you want to ask yourself

940
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,280
ask yourself

941
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,200
ok

942
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,840
I also posted it

943
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,920
on the chat room

944
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
I am quite curious

945
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,760
that

946
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,520
ok

947
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,200
I ask directly

948
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,800
that is

949
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,440
twins

950
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,000
they may

951
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,080
have different

952
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,120
interactions with the environment

953
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,920
their genes

954
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
may have some disappearance

955
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
for example, the fake plan

956
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,440
and so on

957
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,880
as a chemistry

958
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,360
assistant

959
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
I ask this question

960
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,400
if this matter

961
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
is also considered

962
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,760
then we

963
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,800
you just

964
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,080
mentioned in the last page

965
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,200
we assume

966
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,120
when talking about the parameter

967
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,000
you said

968
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
twin genes

969
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,200
we assume it is related to 1

970
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,120
but if we

971
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,600
consider

972
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,160
these

973
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,400
modified

974
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
issues

975
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,920
that obviously

976
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,360
should not be 1

977
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,960
that is

978
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,560
I do not know

979
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,240
this matter

980
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
on behavioral genetics

981
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
how to consider

982
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
I think

983
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I think they

984
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,240
oh

985
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
behavioral genetics

986
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,960
it will explain the method

987
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,720
because you are in the process of the process of

988
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,280
gene is exactly the same

989
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,000
so that causes you

990
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
behind the fake plan process

991
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,200
will be classified as

992
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,280
non-shared environment

993
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,040
is the environment

994
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,800
stimulate the performance of your fake plan

995
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,360
like this

996
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,240
but indeed we can go to see

997
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
the environment and gene

998
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
some of the interaction

999
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,760
so that

1000
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,920
it feels like

1001
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
I do not know

1002
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,400
in

1003
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,480
statistics on this matter

1004
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,440
how you will go to run this analysis

1005
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,360
but it feels like

1006
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,280
genes and the following

1007
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,280
environment

1008
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,960
these two variables

1009
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,800
may be related to

1010
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,440
is not it

1011
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,400
in the model

1012
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
is not related

1013
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,080
to the assumption is not related

1014
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,920
but in statistics

1015
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,200
is not it

1016
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
may be related

1017
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
to the statistics

1018
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,680
I do not know how you

1019
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,200
run analysis

1020
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
but I think in statistics

1021
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,400
is not it

1022
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,240
that is between the variables

1023
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
there is a relationship

1024
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,560
but may not have

1025
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
a contributory problem

1026
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,880
but

1027
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,000
I understand

1028
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,120
your assumption

1029
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
I can comment on a small

1030
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,640
good

1031
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
is

1032
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,720
epigenetics

1033
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,280
side of the impact

1034
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
in fact, a large part

1035
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,560
is from the environment

1036
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
so in fact it can

1037
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,040
even if its epigenetic mutations

1038
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,680
or mutations of histone modification

1039
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
or other

1040
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,280
modifications of the difference

1041
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,920
in fact, a lot from the

1042
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
impact of the environment

1043
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,440
so in fact it should be

1044
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
if I were

1045
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
I would tend to put it

1046
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,080
on the effect of the environment

1047
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,640
like before there is a

1048
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,080
study

1049
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,960
it is a

1050
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,040
identical twin

1051
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
one up in space

1052
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,280
one did not go to space

1053
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,480
and then under the influence of neutrality

1054
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,040
their genetics

1055
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,840
part of the same

1056
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
but epigenetic

1057
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,680
modification

1058
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,080
is very, very large

1059
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,240
so it should still

1060
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
count on the impact of the environment

1061
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,840
thank you

1062
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,960
I just tried to

1063
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,040
express this thing

1064
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,200
but I am actually a little

1065
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
hesitant

1066
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,560
about

1067
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,720
if it is epigenetic

1068
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,600
it seems to be through

1069
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,640
the gene pathway

1070
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
but conceptually we will put it

1071
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,720
on the non-shared environment

1072
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,880
this factor

1073
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
thank you

1074
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
understand

1075
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
you are welcome

1076
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
that

1077
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,680
we still have other questions

1078
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
that I will continue

1079
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,720
that

1080
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,640
will move to the next part of our laboratory

1081
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
that we are called

1082
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,320
the laboratory

1083
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,040
PhD

1084
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,160
Twin Project

1085
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,560
and then my boss is PI

1086
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
that we have done two

1087
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,120
long-term tracking

1088
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,840
first plan is to see

1089
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,160
two to three years old

1090
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,880
and then the second

1091
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
is another set of children

1092
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,080
and then from three years old to five years old

1093
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,240
that my research is mainly

1094
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,480
for the second database

1095
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
is three to five years old before school

1096
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,800
this stage

1097
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,960
that our database

1098
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
there are 310

1099
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
twins of the same gender

1100
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,720
and then a little bit less than

1101
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,320
here

1102
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,160
it is worth noting that

1103
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,520
we are talking about the same gender

1104
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,680
because the same gender twins

1105
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
must be the same gender

1106
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,520
but the same gender

1107
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
may be the same gender

1108
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,480
may be the same gender

1109
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,600
that we want to reduce

1110
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,120
some of the gender-caused

1111
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,800
measurement errors

1112
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,520
so we agreed to

1113
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,080
receive twins of the same gender

1114
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,360
and then

1115
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,440
I have a little story here

1116
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,160
on the first year

1117
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,360
when I still have a chance to talk to the boss

1118
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
face to face

1119
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,400
I asked him

1120
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
where to find so many twins

1121
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,840
and then said

1122
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
oh, we are in Boston

1123
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,440
the progress of reproductive medicine

1124
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,400
is suddenly a big mistake

1125
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,080
that these twins

1126
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,880
some of the artificial

1127
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
results

1128
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
and then

1129
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,360
so our search

1130
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,200
is to be in the twins

1131
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
three years old, four years old, five years old

1132
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
before and after the birthday

1133
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
and then invite them to the lab

1134
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,480
to do the experiment

1135
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,320
that the experiment process

1136
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,120
about three to four hours

1137
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,800
and then we collect a lot of data

1138
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
that is, including behavioral observation

1139
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,320
to some tasks

1140
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,400
and then or questionnaire

1141
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,520
that questionnaire will ask

1142
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,160
parents

1143
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
that is, the main caretaker fill out

1144
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,120
and then the test taker

1145
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,680
will follow

1146
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,120
the process of interacting with children

1147
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,360
to do some evaluation

1148
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
that measurement of the phenomenon

1149
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
we collect

1150
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
the cognitive function of the child's temperament

1151
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
learning performance

1152
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,560
cognitive function and learning performance

1153
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,240
there will be more detailed examples

1154
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
and then there are some

1155
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,280
behavioral problems

1156
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,800
such as internalizing problem

1157
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
or externalizing problem

1158
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,560
that it is a more

1159
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,280
psychopathology classification

1160
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,360
internalizing problem

1161
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,400
is more emotional

1162
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,000
you can imagine

1163
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
those problems that are deeper in the heart

1164
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,360
such as depression, anxiety, etc.

1165
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
externalizing problem

1166
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,880
is more on behavior

1167
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,720
can be observed

1168
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,240
such as

1169
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,400
antisocial behavior

1170
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,040
or attack behavior, etc.

1171
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,160
so we have this kind of data

1172
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,040
and then we also have

1173
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,840
the process of collecting parents

1174
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,920
interacting with children, etc.

1175
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,960
there are more than 300 variables in a year

1176
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,760
so my first year

1177
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,560
is probably to understand

1178
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,680
what is in the database

1179
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,960
but I think I have not yet

1180
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,680
fully understand

1181
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,600
what kind of data

1182
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
and then show you some

1183
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,920
photos of cute children

1184
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,520
when we collect the case

1185
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,440
when they are tested

1186
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,520
are separately tested

1187
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,720
so these are taken at the same time

1188
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,200
is the behind the scenes

1189
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,400
experiment outside the experiment

1190
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,240
and then the computer

1191
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
is to show you

1192
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
we have some tests

1193
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,440
are carried out on the computer

1194
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
and then if the child

1195
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,160
for sitting in the laboratory

1196
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,040
if you feel uncomfortable

1197
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,640
we will invite their parents

1198
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
is to sit in the room

1199
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
but is not to interfere with

1200
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
the child's task

1201
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,320
that is quite interesting

1202
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,480
here is the pool

1203
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,280
it is an observation

1204
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,880
of the child's temperament

1205
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,520
and then there is a story

1206
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,840
that is when I applied

1207
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,560
my boss told me

1208
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,400
I do not have to collect the case

1209
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,680
is to collect

1210
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,240
the analysis of the data

1211
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,480
and then want to see if I can accept

1212
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,320
because someone is

1213
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,920
must play with their own children

1214
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,080
and then I feel a little pity

1215
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,560
but I am not very persistent

1216
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,760
and then I went to the laboratory

1217
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
I saw the recording screen

1218
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,440
because we will first record

1219
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,960
and then the coding

1220
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,560
and then see a lot of children

1221
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,400
once put in the pool

1222
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,960
began to cry and scream

1223
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,720
I originally imagined

1224
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
the pool is a very happy

1225
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,840
environment

1226
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
children should be very happy

1227
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,880
but it seems that a lot of people

1228
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,160
is to be put into a unique space

1229
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,520
and then they feel very afraid

1230
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,840
so like this task

1231
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
we can observe

1232
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,960
the child's fearfulness

1233
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,560
or activity level

1234
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,280
like fearfulness

1235
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,720
is to cry and scream

1236
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,920
or not

1237
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,600
that activity level is also very interesting

1238
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
is their activity

1239
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,280
that we see some children

1240
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,480
is standing crying

1241
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,440
some will only play

1242
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,560
the ball on their feet

1243
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,840
some will run and jump

1244
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,600
and then fall

1245
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,120
and then stand up

1246
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
continue to run and jump

1247
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,880
some will throw all the balls out

1248
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,720
and then the whole laboratory

1249
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,160
is full of their fearfulness

1250
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,200
so you can really see

1251
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,640
a lot of different changes

1252
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
children have different reactions

1253
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,400
so

1254
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
that is

1255
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,040
during the experiment

1256
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,000
we will not interfere with children

1257
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,280
how to play

1258
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
so they can even cry

1259
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,520
the experimenter can only endure

1260
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
and then scream

1261
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,280
endure that scream for three minutes

1262
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
so I feel

1263
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,160
too fortunate

1264
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,400
do not have to play by yourself

1265
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,080
but this child

1266
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,240
looks pretty happy

1267
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,520
it's great

1268
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
and then in the upper right corner

1269
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,400
this is our collection

1270
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,000
a task of parent-child interaction

1271
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,800
this toy is called

1272
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
Etch-a-Sketch

1273
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,320
and then I do not know

1274
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,440
if everyone has seen it in Taiwan

1275
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,320
I do not seem to have played

1276
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,640
it is a board

1277
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,920
and then there are two whirls

1278
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,280
and then one can be controlled up and down

1279
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,760
one can be controlled left and right

1280
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,200
and then

1281
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,480
we will give the children

1282
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
a few pictures with the parents

1283
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,800
and then they have to

1284
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600
within five minutes

1285
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,040
the more pictures the better

1286
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,160
that in the process

1287
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
we can observe a lot of aspects

1288
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
like parents

1289
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,360
will be more authoritative

1290
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
to give instructions

1291
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
or more like a cooperation

1292
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,040
in helping children

1293
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,960
and then we can also see

1294
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,520
some of their physical interaction

1295
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,760
language communication

1296
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,920
or if the child

1297
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,520
today is not

1298
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
want to do this task

1299
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,680
parents will give what reaction

1300
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,760
and so on

1301
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,000
yes

1302
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,560
and then we

1303
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,320
the recipient is

1304
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,720
will be like this

1305
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,200
one by one to the lab

1306
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
is very cute

1307
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,520
do not have to collect their own people

1308
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,800
can say this kind of sarcastic

1309
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,440
and then

1310
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,320
then I will share

1311
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
my two analysis

1312
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,760
that the first one

1313
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,480
we looked at

1314
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,920
at the age of three

1315
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,760
the relationship between

1316
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,040
the child's temperament and school readiness

1317
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,160
how to be explained by

1318
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,960
genes and the environment

1319
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that we first talk about

1320
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,360
what is temperament

1321
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,800
temperament

1322
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,920
it is a child's temperament

1323
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,840
that it can be understood

1324
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,600
on the concept of

1325
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,360
the basis of personality

1326
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,560
the most widely known theory

1327
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,080
should be

1328
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,880
Chase and Thomas

1329
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,560
they divide the baby into

1330
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,240
easy baby

1331
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,000
difficult baby

1332
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
and slow to warm up

1333
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,880
and other

1334
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
and then they have

1335
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
developed more detailed

1336
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,240
classification

1337
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,960
such as

1338
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,480
the ability of the baby's self-adjustment

1339
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,920
the activity of the baby

1340
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,880
their emotional performance

1341
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,560
is high

1342
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,880
or relatively plain

1343
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
or positive emotions

1344
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,240
more

1345
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,040
or negative emotions

1346
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,440
more

1347
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,640
like this

1348
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,120
in addition to

1349
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,800
Chase and Thomas

1350
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,560
theory

1351
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
there are other theories

1352
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,080
but

1353
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
behavioral genetics

1354
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,520
the interesting thing is

1355
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:12,880
found that

1356
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,440
no matter what classification

1357
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,040
we see

1358
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,680
the child's temperament

1359
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,480
has a very high

1360
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,520
heritability

1361
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,960
that is to say

1362
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,320
this thing

1363
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,760
is a bit like a

1364
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,400
metaphor

1365
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,160
genes can explain

1366
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,840
a lot of

1367
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,120
that

1368
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,000
in this study

1369
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,560
we use

1370
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,920
Methody's classification

1371
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,560
it looks at

1372
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,200
activity

1373
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,680
emotion

1374
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,320
and concentration

1375
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,720
and then

1376
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,240
in

1377
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,560
school readiness

1378
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,480
its concept

1379
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,760
is

1380
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,360
children

1381
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,000
how well prepared for

1382
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,520
going to school

1383
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,040
so it's actually

1384
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,080
a pretty broad concept

1385
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,320
like

1386
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,160
children's

1387
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,040
physical development

1388
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,280
because

1389
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,200
like some kindergartens

1390
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,760
they ask

1391
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,640
children to walk

1392
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,440
or eat by themselves

1393
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,480
to go

1394
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,680
then

1395
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,040
or

1396
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,360
children's emotional control

1397
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,160
this kind of

1398
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,280
development of ability

1399
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,640
that

1400
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,440
our study

1401
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,960
focus

1402
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,400
is more like

1403
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,440
academic performance

1404
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,640
then

1405
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:49,920
we use

1406
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,640
Bracken

1407
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
this measurement method

1408
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,360
includes

1409
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,960
them for

1410
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,640
shape

1411
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,240
number

1412
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,640
English alphabets

1413
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,320
color

1414
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,000
size

1415
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,240
this

1416
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,840
in kindergarten

1417
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,440
knowledge

1418
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,640
will be used in the environment

1419
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,600
look at their

1420
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,360
in such a test

1421
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
how high the score can be

1422
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
such

1423
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,280
good

1424
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Why do we want to

1425
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,520
put these two concepts

1426
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,720
connected together

1427
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,240
mainly because

1428
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
past research

1429
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,000
they found

1430
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
children's temperament when they were one year old

1431
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,400
can be predicted

1432
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,280
three or five years later

1433
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,320
school readiness

1434
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,560
so

1435
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
represent these two concepts

1436
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,280
there is some kind of relationship

1437
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,640
but

1438
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,600
this is not a

1439
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,840
behavioral genetics research

1440
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,240
so

1441
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,000
what exactly is

1442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,840
what

1443
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,280
in

1444
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,800
control

1445
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:22,960
is

1446
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,240
genes

1447
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,800
or the environment

1448
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,120
control

1449
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,880
the relationship between these two concepts

1450
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
we are not very clear

1451
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,480
behavioral genetics

1452
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,000
we

1453
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,160
less research in this area

1454
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,400
then

1455
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,040
I found a

1456
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,720
closest

1457
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,200
is

1458
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,800
they look at

1459
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,480
concentration

1460
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,800
and academic performance

1461
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,040
in

1462
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,600
three or four years old

1463
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,200
and then they found

1464
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,720
mainly

1465
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,600
by genes

1466
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,040
to explain

1467
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,520
so

1468
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:40,880
this

1469
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,520
analysis of

1470
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,960
novelty

1471
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,680
is that we want to

1472
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,320
consider at the same time

1473
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,720
different

1474
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,400
child temperament

1475
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,360
and then see if

1476
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,280
this child temperament

1477
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,800
they

1478
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,640
with school readiness

1479
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,200
have

1480
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,960
the same genes

1481
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,640
in control

1482
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,360
or say

1483
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,880
is only

1484
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,480
concentration

1485
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,040
especially this

1486
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,160
child temperament

1487
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,560
is with

1488
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,200
school readiness

1489
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,080
related

1490
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,800
because everyone can imagine

1491
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,920
in the educational scene

1492
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,800
in the field

1493
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,560
does not seem to be

1494
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,240
you very focused

1495
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,760
sitting there

1496
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
you can learn a lot

1497
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,640
but

1498
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,000
your

1499
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,040
emotional connection

1500
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,640
to some

1501
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,040
other social cognitive functions

1502
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,080
may be affected

1503
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,600
or your

1504
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,240
intellectual development

1505
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,000
if today's children

1506
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,680
are surrounded together

1507
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,440
run around

1508
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,160
some things

1509
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,680
and then they can

1510
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,080
learn from the process

1511
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,880
but you just

1512
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,400
sit there

1513
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,320
very focused

1514
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,560
so

1515
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,160
it seems

1516
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,040
to learn from you

1517
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,920
is not necessarily

1518
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
a very stable

1519
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,960
truth

1520
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,360
development

1521
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,680
so

1522
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,840
good

1523
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,360
that

1524
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,200
before we put

1525
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,600
the data

1526
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,000
into the model

1527
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,280
just like

1528
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,200
just to talk about

1529
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,000
our analysis

1530
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,320
is

1531
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,040
the relationship between twins

1532
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,000
so we have to make sure

1533
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,240
the relationship is established

1534
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,800
and

1535
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,280
on the one hand

1536
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,000
is that we are discussing

1537
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
individual differences

1538
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,880
we have to make sure

1539
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,680
there are enough

1540
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
individual differences

1541
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,240
we go to

1542
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,760
analyze that

1543
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,520
these individual differences

1544
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,400
because of the environment

1545
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,040
or genes

1546
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,640
more meaningful

1547
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:40,920
that

1548
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,560
picture

1549
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,280
you can see

1550
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,880
purple is

1551
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,800
same-sex twins

1552
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
and pink is

1553
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,960
same-sex twins

1554
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,680
that

1555
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,360
the picture on the left

1556
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,040
is talking about

1557
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,160
in each phenomenon

1558
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,640
the relationship between twins

1559
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,960
that is to say

1560
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,520
in the emotional aspect

1561
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
same-sex twins

1562
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,280
their correlation

1563
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,840
and same-sex twins

1564
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
their correlation

1565
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,400
and

1566
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,040
task orientation

1567
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,200
refers to focus

1568
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,520
and

1569
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,120
score readiness

1570
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,400
that

1571
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,200
score readiness

1572
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,360
that

1573
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,000
picture on the right

1574
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
may be more interesting

1575
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,240
it

1576
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,160
we call it

1577
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,640
cross-chain

1578
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
cross-chain correlation

1579
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,880
it refers to

1580
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,280
we use

1581
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,840
twins

1582
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,160
one of the A-phenomenon

1583
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,920
to correlate

1584
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880

1585
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,760
B-phenomenon

1586
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,440
then we go

1587
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:13,920
is to run

1588
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,200
related analysis

1589
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,840
that

1590
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,200
flesh and blood

1591
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
we can see

1592
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,000
same-sex twins

1593
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,560
compared to

1594
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,280
same-sex twins

1595
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,120
have a higher

1596
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,960
correlation

1597
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,200
so

1598
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,720
this can

1599
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,160
tell us very roughly

1600
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,640
genes

1601
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,160
in explaining

1602
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,080
these two concepts

1603
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,360
is a certain degree of

1604
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,800
impact

1605
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,080
that

1606
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,800
how much is specific

1607
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,480
we have to

1608
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,120
run a

1609
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,480
model

1610
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,160
to know

1611
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,080
then

1612
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,080
this

1613
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,720
then

1614
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:33,960
we

1615
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,280
fit

1616
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,640
is a

1617
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,400
biometric

1618
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
cholesky model

1619
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,840
then

1620
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,200
it is

1621
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,720
the general

1622
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,200
cholesky

1623
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,600
model

1624
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,320
inside the factor

1625
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,600
in

1626
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,200
further

1627
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,880
cut into

1628
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,640
genes

1629
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,400
shared environment

1630
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,680
and

1631
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,920
non-shared environment

1632
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,360
then

1633
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,240
it's a bit messy

1634
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,560
so I

1635
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,000
step by step

1636
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,600
to look at

1637
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,160
this model

1638
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,280
that

1639
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,600
is

1640
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,160
we have three

1641
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,640
phenomena

1642
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,000
then

1643
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,440
we use

1644
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,840
genes

1645
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,000

here

1652
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,120
there is a

represents

1657
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,160

1661
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,280
the focus

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,720
are both

that

1799
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,520
the same concept

1800
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,040
we can

1801
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,400
use

1802
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,840
is

1803
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,600
the same

1804
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:18,800

1805
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,160
apply

1806
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,600
to

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,080
here

1814
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,560
want to emphasize

1815
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,000
is

1816
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,520
that

1817
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,040
the picture

1818
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,400
see

1819
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,000
all these

1820
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,440
factors

1821
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,600
and

1822
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:26,840
past

1823
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,080

1824
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,560
at the same

1825
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,560


1826
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,320
predicted

1827
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,640
like this

1828
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,560
and

1829
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,880
then

1830
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,200
we

1831
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,520
use

1832
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:32,880
a

method

1836
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,640
that is to say

1837
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:34,880

beautiful

1841
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,760
we will

1842
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,080
drop

1843
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,240

1848
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,560
factor

1849
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,320
and

1850
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,640
we

1851
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,040
finally

1852
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,600
get

1853
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,000
the

like this

1857
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,720
so

1858
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:45,920
this

1859
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,200

1860
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,680

1861
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,480
what

1862
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,040
this is

1863
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,680
indeed

1864
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:48,800
in

1865
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,560

00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,600
look

1998
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Tienxianbaobao

1999
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,760
then learn

2000
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,080
some

2001
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,640
color

2002
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:54,960
and

2003
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,400
numbers

2004
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,080
such as the concept

2005
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,000
of these

2006
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,280
environmental

2007
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,760
impact can

2008
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,720
let children's

2009
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,440
school readiness

2010
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,000
to move in the same direction

2011
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,640
may be able to

2012
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,400
improve their

2013
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,040
school readiness

2014
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,560
ability

2015
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,280
and

2016
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,120
this factor can

2017
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,600
explain the

2018
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
variation is probably

2019
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,320
about 40%

2020
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,880
I want to square it

2021
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,920
about

2022
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,200
the rest of the

2023
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
good part

2024
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,320
is that

2025
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,120
can be shared

2026
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,560
environment

2027
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,400
so

2028
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,760
that is

2029
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,320
including some of

2030
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,520
us

2031
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,280
do not want to face

2032
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,640
the measurement

2033
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,080
error

2034
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,040
or say

2035
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,960
this may be

2036
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,400
because

2037
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,320
the same

2038
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,840
rater

2039
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
in the evaluation

2040
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,280
of children's

2041
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
children's temperament

2042
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,680
so we see

2043
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,560
non-shared environment

2044
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
can explain

2045
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,080
the two

2046
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,640
covariance between the two

2047
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,680
good

2048
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,080
and then

2049
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,800
summarize

2050
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,760
so this analysis

2051
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,360
tells us

2052
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,800
we are in

2053
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,520
three years old

2054
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,160
to see

2055
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,960
child temperament

2056
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,920
with school readiness

2057
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,720
between the relevant

2058
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,400
are because

2059
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,600
the same gene

2060
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
behind the child

2061
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,560
temperament

2062
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,120
in the emotion

2063
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,760
this aspect

2064
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,480
is independent

2065
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,000
focus

2066
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,560
this aspect

2067
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:46,920
of the gene

2068
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
and the shared environment

2069
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,360
is only

2070
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,920
in

2071
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
school readiness

2072
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:50,840
above

2073
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,480
there is a significant

2074
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,160
impact

2075
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,840
so

2076
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,040
that we have to

2077
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,600
this analysis

2078
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,040
there is no

2079
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,320
what

2080
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,440
you want to ask

2081
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
the question

2082
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,240
of the host

2083
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,640
think

2084
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,240
OK

2085
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
very clear

2086
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
thank you

2087
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,320
good

2088
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,000
that I will

2089
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,920
move to

2090
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
the second analysis

2091
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,240
so

2092
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,800
that

2093
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,120
just a little bit about

2094
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,880
academic performance

2095
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,720
and cognitive functions

2096
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,520
are not the same

2097
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,080
so

2098
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,000
now this story

2099
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,480
will be more

2100
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,840
around

2101
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,200
the development of cognitive functions

2102
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,000
that we look at

2103
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
is three to five years old

2104
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,600
impulse control

2105
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:24,800
so

2106
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,360
impulse control

2107
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,880
is

2108
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,120
one of the cognitive functions

2109
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,360
so

2110
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,440
there is a background

2111
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,880
introduction

2112
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:29,920
impulse control

2113
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,680
he is talking about

2114
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,400
to adjust

2115
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,920
impulse

2116
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,200
with

2117
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,800
inhibits

2118
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,120
is also

2119
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,720
to suppress

2120
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,360
with the goal

2121
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,080
unrelated

2122
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,840
interference ability

2123
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,640
that in early childhood

2124
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,240
genes

2125
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,760
and the environment

2126
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,520
is how to explain

2127
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,400
impulse control

2128
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,920
we currently

2129
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
find the result

2130
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,040
a bit

2131
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,600
diverse

2132
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,520
such as

2133
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,280
our lab

2134
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,720
before

2135
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,120
for

2136
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,080
two or three years old

2137
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,880
child information

2138
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,480
with

2139
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,920
UW

2140
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,400
medicine

2141
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,800
there

2142
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,560
biopsy research

2143
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,640
have found

2144
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,280
the same

2145
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,280
result

2146
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,520
is

2147
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,200
quite strange

2148
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,200
when we use

2149
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,600
parents

2150
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,080
to assess

2151
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,720
impulse control

2152
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
to analyze

2153
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,280
in

2154
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,680
two years old

2155
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,280
and three years old

2156
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
we all see

2157
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,240
inhibits

2158
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,640
control

2159
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,320
can be

2160
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,360
explained by genes

2161
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,440
but

2162
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,000
when we use

2163
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,960
behavioral observation

2164
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,360
is

2165
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,680
there is a

2166
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:05,840
called

2167
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,080
lab

2168
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,400
tap

2169
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,520
this way

2170
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,760
we only see

2171
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,160
genes

2172
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,760
can explain

2173
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,920
impulse control at two years old

2174
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,760
he has no way to explain

2175
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,000
impulse control at three years old

2176
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,080
yes

2177
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,440
that

2178
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,160
more strange

2179
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,680
is to say

2180
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,400
in

2181
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,840
nine years old

2182
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,600
child

2183
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,240
when we use

2184
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,920
another method

2185
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,600
is cognitive

2186
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,040
phase

2187
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,720
may be through some

2188
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,080
cognitive

2189
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,440
test

2190
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
cognitive task

2191
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,080
or computerized

2192
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,440
test

2193
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,240
to measure

2194
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,520
their

2195
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,960
inhibits

2196
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,360
control

2197
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,120
we found

2198
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,120
it can be

2199
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
explained by genes

2200
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,680
so

2201
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,520
this makes us feel

2202
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,000
with

2203
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,600
behavioral

2204
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
observation

2205
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,480
see

2206
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,040
no genes

2207
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,640
can explain

2208
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,520
impulse control at three years old

2209
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,200
a bit strange

2210
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,520
because

2211
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,360
although

2212
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,880
development

2213
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,440
is a

2214
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,400
dynamic process

2215
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,200
but you can not imagine

2216
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,520
genes

2217
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,400
will be open

2218
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,760
so he

2219
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,240
in the end is

2220
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,000
can explain

2221
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,800
or can not explain

2222
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,800
that our

2223
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,320
idea

2224
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,800
may be

2225
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,400
our idea

2226
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,840
is to say

2227
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,760
may be

2228
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,320
behavior

2229
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,000
observation

2230
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,320
a bit

2231
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:50,960
a bit

2232
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,520
limited

2233
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,000
like

2234
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,520
our

2235
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,560
test process

2236
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,080
is to measure

2237
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,640
children's

2238
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,000
delay

2239
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,840
gratification

2240
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,760
that

2241
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,080
task

2242
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,760
like we

2243
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,440
give children

2244
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,160
to see

2245
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,600
chocolate

2246
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,400
but they have to wait

2247
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,680
a certain

2248
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,160
second

2249
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,600
can eat

2250
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,080
chocolate

2251
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,600
so

2252
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:03,920
yes

2253
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,600
in the process of

2254
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:04,680
experiment

2255
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,040
we will feed

2256
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,280
children

2257
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,400
eat

2258
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,880
chocolate

2259
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,320
that

2260
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,120
this ability

2261
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,480
may be

2262
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,120
at three years old

2263
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,480
children

2264
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,920
have

2265
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,880
learned all

2266
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,320
that

2267
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:10,800
is

2268
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,200
this is a

2269
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,880
socialized

2270
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,360
process

2271
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,600
so

2272
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,120
the environment

2273
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,760
suppressed

2274
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,120
their

2275
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,560
inhibits

2276
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,000
control

2277
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,840
and then

2278
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,280
put them

2279
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,840
all

2280
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,600
described

2281
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,480
in the same way

2282
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:18,960
that

2283
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,400
this

2284
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,160
environment

2285
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,760
force

2286
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,160
will let

2287
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,520
genes

2288
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:21,960
no place

2289
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,520
to show

2290
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,680
so we

2291
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,080
want to say

2292
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,200
oh

2293
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,400
that

2294
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,720
or we

2295
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,160
use another

2296
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,520
way

2297
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:25,760
to measure

2298
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,160
children's

2299
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,480
impulse

2300
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:26,880
control

2301
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,200
good

2302
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,200
so

2303
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,800
in this

2304
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,200
analysis

2305
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,400
inside

2306
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,920
we use

2307
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,120
is

2308
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,520
Flanker

2309
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:30,920
task

2310
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,120
then

2311
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,440
it is

2312
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,640
from

2313
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,000
NIH

toolbox

2315
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,720
inside

2316
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,040
a

2317
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,360
test

2318
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:33,920
that

2319
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,080
everyone

2320
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,680
may have done

2321
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,240
the adult version

2322
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,320
of

2323
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,680
Flanker

2324
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,000
task

2325
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,520
it is

2326
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:36,920
there will be

2327
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,600
different

2328
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,000
arrows

2329
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,280
pointing

2330
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,560
different

2331
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:38,960
ways

2332
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,680
different

2333
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,040
directions

2334
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,560
and then

2335
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,760
you have to

2336
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,160
observe

2337
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,960
the arrow in the middle

2338
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,560
that

2339
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,080
arrow in the middle

2340
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,320
sometimes

2341
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,600
will be with

2342
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,240
the direction

2343
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,520
of the opposite

2344
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,040
that you can not

2345
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,880
be next to the arrow

2346
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,400
confused

2347
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,880
like this

2348
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,800
good

2349
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,200
it is a

2350
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,680
quite classic

2351
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,080
measure

2352
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,720
executive

2353
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,200
function

2354
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,920
task

2355
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,680
that

2356
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,040
for

2357
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,560
children's

2358
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:53,840
task

2359
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,240
child's

2360
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,800
experiment

2361
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,040
we

2362
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,360
in order to

2363
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,160
let them focus

2364
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,520
we will

2365
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,200
the story

2366
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,560
package

2367
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
a little fun

2368
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,760
then we

2369
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,120
package

2370
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,640
the story is

2371
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,160
that we

2372
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
today to feed the fish

2373
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,600
so you have to

2374
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:01,840
look at

2375
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,360
the middle

2376
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,960
of this fish

2377
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,200
it is

2378
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,600
facing

2379
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:03,960
this

2380
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,200
or

2381
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,640
this

2382
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,320
that

2383
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,720
because they

2384
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,000
answer

2385
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,240
the way

2386
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,440
is to

2387
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,640
point

2388
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,960
screen

2389
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,280
is good

2390
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,720
so even

2391
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,240
the main part

2392
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,680
can still

2393
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,000
carry out

2394
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,680
this experiment

2395
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,760
and then

2396
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:11,960
we

2397
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,680
also look at

2398
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,360
related

2399
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,880
that everyone

2400
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,240
may be

2401
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,800
notice

2402
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,720
this analysis

2403
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,200
related

2404
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,800
with the previous

2405
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,160
analysis

2406
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,520
relative

2407
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,960
is

2408
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,360
compared to

2409
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,360
a lot of difference

2410
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,000
but

2411
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,520
they are still

2412
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,040
obvious

2413
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,840
so we can still

2414
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,920
follow-up analysis

2415
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,240
and then

2416
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,720
another point

2417
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,200
want to add

2418
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,560
is that we

2419
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:25,960
look here

2420
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,120
is the

2421
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,920
cross-age

2422
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,600
relationship

2423
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,240
is

2424
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,160
every age

2425
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,360
related

2426
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,560
with

2427
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,160
cross-age

2428
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,880
related

2429
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,400
that

2430
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,960
we use

2431
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,200
is

2432
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,440
rank

2433
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,880
order

2434
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,600
that ability

2435
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,360
multiply

2436
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,720
multiply

2437
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,040
is

2438
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,760
PR value

2439
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,320
so if

2440
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,000
three years old

2441
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,440
child's

2442
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:38,880
PR value

2443
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,480
is 95

2444
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,160
four years old

2445
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,760
is 95

2446
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,120
that

2447
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,440
the relationship

2448
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,120
will be very high

2449
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,680
and not

2450
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,520
use the original result

2451
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:43,840
because

2452
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,640
in theory

2453
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,080
this time

2454
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,720
their cognitive

2455
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,960
function

2456
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,560
should develop

2457
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,120
quickly

2458
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,480
so you

2459
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,960
three or four years old

2460
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,800
get the same score

2461
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,240
is not a

2462
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,560
very good

2463
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:49,880
phenomenon

2464
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,240
that

2465
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,120
here is not very

2466
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,360
high

2467
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,760
related

2468
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,720
to tell us that

2469
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
in this period of time

2470
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,240
they

2471
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,960
impulse control

2472
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,680
ability to develop

2473
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
in fact, there are many

2474
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,200
changes

2475
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,960
that may be

2476
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,400
at any time

2477
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,120
children suddenly

2478
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
become black horse

2479
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,400
and then become

2480
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,200
super focused

2481
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,640
and super

2482
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:02,920
can

2483
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,600
self-control

2484
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:03,920
like this

2485
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,280
and then

2486
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,040
we put the same

2487
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,440
data

2488
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:07,840
fit to

2489
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,240
model

2490
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:08,920
although

2491
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,440
here is also

2492
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,880
fit a

2493
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,360
Cholesky

2494
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:10,720
model

2495
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,120
but

2496
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,880
behavioral genetics

2497
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,120
or

2498
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,840
twin research

2499
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,360
is not only

2500
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,920
this model

2501
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,360
can be used

2502
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,040
this is more like

2503
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,000
the process of my practice

2504
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,480
but

2505
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,160
you can see

2506
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,880
that this model

2507
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,280
is actually in

2508
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,120
the development of research

2509
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,720
is quite

2510
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,280
a good model

2511
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,800
because

2512
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,240
like

2513
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,040
in the previous example

2514
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,720
it tells us

2515
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,000
how many factors

2516
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,400
between different concepts

2517
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,000
can be

2518
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:27,960
how many factors

2519
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,600
are overlapped

2520
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,080
that

2521
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,560
here, then

2522
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,320
it can tell us

2523
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,680
in

2524
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
different periods of development

2525
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:32,960
those

2526
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,880
stable

2527
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,320
with new

2528
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,600
added factors

2529
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:35,920
is

2530
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,560
stability

2531
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,200
and change

2532
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,520
can be how

2533
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,200
explained

2534
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,880
is how to be

2535
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,080
explained by genes and the environment

2536
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:41,800
that

2537
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,120
our

2538
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,400
best

2539
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,200
fitting model

2540
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,760
tells us

2541
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,040
the first

2542
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,480
most important

2543
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:44,720
is

2544
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
the shared environment

2545
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,120
does not show the impact

2546
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,640
but

2547
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,200
most of them

2548
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,440
are

2549
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,800
genes

2550
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,280
are explained by genes and

2551
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,720
non-shared environment

2552
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:51,960
that

2553
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,880
age to age

2554
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,920
stability

2555
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,200
is that

2556
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,720
these will

2557
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,440
cross

2558
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,240
different age

2559
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,600
paths

2560
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,440
are

2561
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
the effect of genes

2562
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,680
so

2563
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,640
why do we see

2564
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,000
stable development between ages

2565
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,960
are all because of genes

2566
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,000
is explained by genes

2567
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,600
that

2568
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,080
but

2569
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,000
those changes

2570
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,040
across ages

2571
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,520
is

2572
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,640
genes and

2573
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,560
non-shared environment

2574
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:11,920
together

2575
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,840
to create

2576
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,080
the effect

2577
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,600
like this

2578
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:15,800
good

2579
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,680
so

2580
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,600
you may be curious

2581
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,880
that

2582
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,800
these new genes

2583
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,760
represent what

2584
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,600
this may mean

2585
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,080
we are

2586
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,320
in the process of development

2587
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:24,560
like

2588
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,160
just

2589
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:26,560
right

2590
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:26,800
no

2591
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,120
good

2592
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,320
this

2593
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,920
we can see

2594
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,520
the brain

2595
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,320
or other

2596
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,160
physiological development

2597
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,320
that

2598
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,840
this is

2599
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,120
the place where DNA can perform

2600
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,720
then

2601
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,400
I put this

2602
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:34,840
model

2603
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,040
change a way to perform

2604
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,720
is to put those

2605
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,880
factors

2606
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,440
into

2607
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,240
the model

2608
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,680
and then

2609
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,600
here want to see is

2610
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,800
in every age

2611
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,600
between

2612
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,760
in every age

2613
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,400
we see the

2614
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:45,960
variance

2615
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,320
how much can be

2616
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,760
explained by genes or non-shared environment

2617
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,120
that

2618
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,400
we can pay attention to is

2619
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,240
every age

2620
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:53,840
of

2621
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,320
mutations are different

2622
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,520
and then

2623
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,480
we draw here is the percentage

2624
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,440
so interesting is

2625
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,880
although mutations themselves are different

2626
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,680
but genes can explain the proportion

2627
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,880
is quite stable

2628
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,080
that

2629
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,320
is 35%

2630
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,200
36%

2631
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,640
that

2632
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,640
this is the proportion

2633
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,560
we just mentioned

2634
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,320
heritability

2635
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,400
is genes can explain

2636
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,680
what percentage of mutations

2637
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:09,880
that

2638
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,240
if we look more carefully

2639
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,480
we can see

2640
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,360
at the age of four

2641
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,080
most of the

2642
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,800
heritability

2643
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,400
is explained by the genes

2644
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,760
of the new performance at the age of four

2645
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,360
about 80% of these

2646
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,280
heritability

2647
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,400
but at the age of five

2648
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,680
the new genes

2649
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,520
only show

2650
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,520
50% of the

2651
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,280
heritability

2652
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,200
and the rest is

2653
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,680
in the previous age

2654
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,720
the effect of those genes that have been left behind

2655
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,480
so this

2656
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,640
result tells us

2657
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,200
is the longest

2658
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,840
highest number of

2659
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,080
people

2660
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,880
still worth it

2661
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,920
it can tell us some

2662
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,000
more interesting

2663
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,320
genes

2664
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,520
in the process of development

2665
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,600
is how to change

2666
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,120
this

2667
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,800
good

2668
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,320
that

2669
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,840
the same

2670
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,080
small summary

2671
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,320
so we see

2672
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,000
three to five years old

2673
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,480
the stability of the age range

2674
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,360
is all explained by the genes

2675
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,000
but the change in the age range

2676
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,080
is explained by the genes and non-shared environment

2677
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,600
and

2678
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,480
the shared environment

2679
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,240
no way

2680
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,240
to impulse control

2681
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,520
has a significant impact

2682
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,000
and I remember

2683
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,840
I last summer

2684
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,760
with my university teacher

2685
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,360
Mr. Wu Wen-Chi

2686
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,200
share this result

2687
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,880
is that he is a pair of

2688
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,520
dragon and phoenix

2689
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,040
and then at that time

2690
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,560
four or five years old

2691
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,320
and I said

2692
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,120
surprised

2693
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,800
parents can not use the same way

2694
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,560
to improve the ability of children to impulse control

2695
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,480
and then he

2696
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,200
laughed for a moment

2697
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,200
do not need to do the experiment

2698
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,000
I knew

2699
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,640
because the children

2700
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,680
do not care what you are doing

2701
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,440
and I feel

2702
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,720
so strong sense of helplessness and helplessness

2703
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,320
is really quite hard parents

2704
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,040
OK

2705
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,480
here to stop

2706
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,200
good for

2707
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,080
these two analysis

2708
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,600
have what

2709
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
you want to ask the question

2710
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,920
I want to ask

2711
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,640
is

2712
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,480
Although

2713
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,560
because the environment

2714
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,800
between the twins

2715
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,720
is the same

2716
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,400
but

2717
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,240
every pair of twins

2718
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,920
is the difference between

2719
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,040
their social

2720
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,640
economic

2721
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,040
rank

2722
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,120
will not affect them

2723
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,760
I think

2724
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,320
social economic status

2725
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,000
so that is the family

2726
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,600
family shared

2727
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,000
those environmental factors

2728
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,480
is it

2729
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,760
right

2730
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,320
because

2731
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,720
it will be calculated to

2732
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,760
the shared environment

2733
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,160
you say in the impulse control

2734
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,680
will not affect the shared environment

2735
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,840
because I found that

2736
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,360
there is no

2737
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,800
I'm just curious to say

2738
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,160
in fact, not in this

2739
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,120
this comparison

2740
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,120
but to say

2741
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,360
in your observation

2742
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,320
different pairs of twins

2743
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,520
social economic

2744
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,040
situation

2745
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,960
will affect

2746
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,680
their child's

2747
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,280
impulse control

2748
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
I do not seem to

2749
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,120
particularly in this direction

2750
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,520
development

2751
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,720
discovery

2752
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:36,840
Yeah

2753
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:40,920
I think

2754
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,320
in the impulsive control

2755
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,400
or child development

2756
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,920
in most cases, they will focus on

2757
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,000
the education of the mother

2758
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,280
is a lot of information

2759
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:48,780
it is now

2760
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,680
on this

2761
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,040
but

2762
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,560
is most of the mother

2763
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:50,880
education

2764
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,320
will be called

2765
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,440
social

2766
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
economic status

2767
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,760
parel

2768
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,240
but that

2769
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,880
is not

2770
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,440
the idea of ​​the whole big

2771
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,360
SES generalization

2772
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,440
there is

2773
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:03,840
a

2774
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,880
sort

2775
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:05,680
have

2776
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,040
it

2777
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,760
I want to add just

2778
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,160
Tsinghua

2779
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,240
Tsinghua teacher

2780
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,280
of the problem

2781
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,000
so in fact

2782
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,560
because you just

2783
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,320
in fact, have mentioned that

2784
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,040
you Boston

2785
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:12,440
this

2786
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,240
this study

2787
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,560
is most of

2788
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,960
the medical center of

2789
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,840
medical promotion so I can imagine

2790
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,640
in fact, your whole

2791
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:18,720
I do not know

2792
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,560
is not the fact

2793
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,680
but I feel

2794
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,720
your whole sample size

2795
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
sample should be

2796
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,040
very

2797
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,160
very biased

2798
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,440
is

2799
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,240
I say so

2800
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:25,560
is not

2801
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,880
not to criticize your

2802
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,680
sample

2803
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,280
I mean

2804
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:28,760
so it sounds like

2805
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,600
your sample should

2806
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:31,760
not

2807
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,320
I just say

2808
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,880
I like to hear

2809
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,440
your sample

2810
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:33,840
is more

2811
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,680
higher

2812
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,800
knowledge level

2813
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,560
or high

2814
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,560
economic level

2815
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,040
and then

2816
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,840
is just mentioned

2817
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,400
you talk about that

2818
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,000
educational level

2819
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,000
in fact, I think

2820
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:41,960
this thing

2821
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,560
I think it is very interesting

2822
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,840
because

2823
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,400
I do not know

2824
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:43,840
you know

2825
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,160
that is

2826
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,520
they have to discuss

2827
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,440
all of the

2828
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,240
social economy

2829
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,960
of these

2830
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,520
social economic

2831
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,040
background

2832
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,680
these social economic

2833
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,080
it is actually a

2834
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,680
cluster

2835
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,720
that this cluster

2836
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,160
inside

2837
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:56,640
like

2838
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,000
it

2839
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,200
he thought

2840
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,000
that is

2841
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,920
formal education

2842
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,960
is inside the host

2843
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,600
that is

2844
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,200
this change

2845
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,600
it is actually

2846
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,960
all of the control of that

2847
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,160
your social and economic

2848
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,640
for example, say

2849
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,440
your education level

2850
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:06,960
higher

2851
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,680
your

2852
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,440
whole economic level

2853
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,120
you will be higher

2854
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,680
usually

2855
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,000
that is

2856
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,560
if it is a large sample

2857
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,040
it is such a phenomenon

2858
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:13,920
so I think

2859
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,360
that is

2860
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,320
to reflect back

2861
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,880
this question

2862
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,400
is to say

2863
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,520
this is actually

2864
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,160
in your observation

2865
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,840
will

2866
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,560
this thing

2867
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,120
is for you

2868
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,520
the whole

2869
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,440
discovery of research

2870
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,800
is

2871
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:24,920
there

2872
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,840
an alternative

2873
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,640
mechanism

2874
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:28,840
I do not know

2875
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,000
my

2876
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,240
yes

2877
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,040
I think

2878
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
pretty clear

2879
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:32,680
yes

2880
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,480
this is indeed

2881
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,000
our

2882
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,760
inside the sample

2883
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,360
is actually quite

2884
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,400
homogenous

2885
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,240
most

2886
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:37,760
are

2887
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,440
quite good

2888
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,200
education level

2889
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,440
and then

2890
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:39,960
because Boston

2891
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
is a lot of universities

2892
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,320
and then

2893
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,360
Boston population

2894
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,000
itself is

2895
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,800
mainly white people

2896
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,080
and then

2897
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,600
the proportion of black people

2898
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,120
is quite small

2899
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,600
Asians

2900
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,400
more than black people

2901
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,200
so this is a

2902
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,120
quite strange structure

2903
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,800
and then

2904
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,080
I only

2905
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,840
discussed with my boss

2906
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,400
this issue

2907
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,720
and then

2908
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,360
he

2909
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
gave me a

2910
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,600
get over it

2911
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,240
that

2912
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,000
explanation is

2913
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,760
we can say

2914
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,320
a bit like

2915
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,040
we are in the sample

2916
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,560
regress

2917
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,120
this

2918
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,000
impression

2919
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,520
but

2920
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:00,880
even if

2921
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,200
regress

2922
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,680
this impression

2923
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,520
we still have to see

2924
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,320
common

2925
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,800
those

2926
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,120
environmental factors

2927
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,840
that we can

2928
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,000
focus on

2929
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,480
if

2930
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:07,680
good

2931
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,080
we know

2932
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,840
is not SES

2933
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,800
that we can think about

2934
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,280
that other

2935
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,720
is what

2936
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,000
environmental

2937
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,560
common factors

2938
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,520
can explain this

2939
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,200
we find

2940
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,280
those factors

2941
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,520
right

2942
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:16,720
that

2943
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,200
is

2944
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,600
that the problem

2945
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,320
does exist in our

2946
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,800
sample

2947
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,120
that we

2948
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,320
think of another way

2949
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,640
to

2950
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,880
how to be more effective

2951
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,520
to use our

2952
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:22,960
data

2953
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,440
like this

2954
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,600
I also have

2955
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,280
understand

2956
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,720
I also have a

2957
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
curious question

2958
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,400
that is

2959
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,120
I am watching

2960
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,560
your

2961
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:32,800
this

2962
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
research

2963
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,400
because its

2964
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,080
sample size

2965
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,720
is very large

2966
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,880
and

2967
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,360
its

2968
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,560
cross-age

2969
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
is several

2970
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,240
so

2971
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,440
your

2972
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,240
dropout rate

2973
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,560
is probably how high

2974
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,800
and I was thinking

2975
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,280
if

2976
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,720
very low

2977
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,280
is not

2978
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,920
related to

2979
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,240
just

2980
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,880
high-risk

2981
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,360
because you

2982
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,040
here

2983
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,040
is the participant

2984
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,280
it has a very special

2985
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:53,760
this

2986
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,520
high

2987
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,160
SES

2988
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,000
situation

2989
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,760
right

2990
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,520
right

2991
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,680
I

2992
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,400
must say

2993
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,920
I think

2994
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,800
300 pairs of twins

2995
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,480
is not a very large

2996
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,120
sample size

2997
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,360
is

2998
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,000
Robin Pullman

2999
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,480
he was invited to the UK

3000
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,200
they are doing

3001
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,560
more than 7,000 pairs of twins

3002
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,000
so I think

3003
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,320
can not be compared

3004
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:11,920
then

3005
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,440
our dropout rate

3006
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,120
in the first year is probably 10%

3007
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,000
the second year is probably

3008
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,320
12-13%

3009
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,120
or so

3010
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,320
so

3011
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,920
I think it is a

3012
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,240
state that can be accepted

3013
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,440
because

3014
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,120
mainly

3015
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,240
as we have talked about

3016
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,520
our

3017
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,120
twin study assumption is

3018
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,000
still twins

3019
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,240
is 50% of the gene

3020
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,200
that is on average

3021
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,400
so

3022
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,360
it will affect

3023
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,040
we have to have

3024
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,320
enough twins

3025
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,760
to do this assumption

3026
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,880
or there will be a lot of

3027
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,360
bias

3028
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:36,920
thank you

3029
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,120
thank you

3030
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,400
that

3031
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,280
is not possible

3032
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,680
I think

3033
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,480
in Boston

3034
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,240
the benefit of the case

3035
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,160
should indeed be

3036
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,720
parents will be more willing

3037
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,000
to contribute

3038
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,440
their children to the CNS

3039
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,760
there are other questions?

3040
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,240
Then I will jump to

3041
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,880
the last slide

3042
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,680
so it is

3043
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,920
a simple summary

3044
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,440
of the first behavior study

3045
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:02,960
it is a

3046
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,360
can be studied at the same time

3047
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,520
genes and environment

3048
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,080
how to affect

3049
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,760
an experiment method of individual behavior

3050
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,120
and then

3051
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,640
is

3052
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,440
to respond to

3053
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
the struggle between Socrates and Plato

3054
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,680
is in our human

3055
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,560
development process

3056
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,520
genes and the environment

3057
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,040
are at the same time

3058
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,000
have a significant impact

3059
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,480
like this

3060
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,600
and then

3061
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,120
then

3062
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,040
it is a bit of a response to

3063
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,400
the previous

3064
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,440
research by Robert Pullman

3065
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,240
is that children in

3066
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,080
the development process

3067
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,800
is not passive

3068
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,600
affected by the environment

3069
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,520
but children's genes

3070
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,120
will also actively

3071
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,320
interact with their environment

3072
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:29,880
is to produce

3073
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,560
and then

3074
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,080
it is

3075
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,680
we know

3076
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,720
genes and the environment

3077
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,960
have a significant impact

3078
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,800
on the development

3079
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,480
and this impact

3080
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,600
will change over time

3081
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,160
this is the above

3082
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,440
simple summary

3083
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,200
of what I have covered today

3084
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,160
and then

3085
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,760
here, then

3086
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,800
you can search

3087
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,920
is that it will connect to my

3088
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Facebook Medium

3089
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,880
or Clubhouse

3090
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,560
and then

3091
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,080
Medium

3092
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,880
there are some

3093
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,360
that is

3094
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,200
in the United States

3095
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,760
some of the

3096
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,360
Dr.

3097
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,920
Murmur

3098
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,440
every month

3099
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:53,920
and then

3100
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,480
if you want to

3101
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,080
group up

3102
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,960
can read

3103
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,160
that if you want to

3104
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,760
save time

3105
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,280
I will

3106
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,240
put it in the description

3107
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,800
and then

3108
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,360
if you want to

3109
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,360
use the social process of the Provincial Office

3110
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,880
you can

3111
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,080
send it directly to my email

3112
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,000
I will also reply

3113
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,520
like this

3114
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,960
and then

3115
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,480
is

3116
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,480
Q&A time

3117
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,280
I hope everyone

3118
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,040
is not like this

3119
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,080
little friend so confused

3120
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,600
but

3121
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,360
very welcome

3122
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,480
all kinds of discussions

3123
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,000
like this

3124
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,600
then I will talk about it here today

3125
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,280
thank you all

3126
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,920
I think today

3127
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,840
is like a word

3128
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,600
learned a lot

3129
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,440
this is not a course

3130
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,040
because

3131
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,680
that is

3132
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:24,880
as a

3133
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,880
developmental psychology

3134
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,640
PhD student

3135
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,120
is

3136
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,680
often in the course

3137
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,680
a lot of

3138
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,960
research on this

3139
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,760
but I think

3140
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,240
is

3141
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,760
a word

3142
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,560
that can be like

3143
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,520
I think there

3144
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,720
may be related areas

3145
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,840
may be different areas

3146
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,160
can be very clear

3147
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,680
put a

3148
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,960
I think it may be quite complicated

3149
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,640
that model

3150
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,080
with

3151
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:41,640
I

3152
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,520
although you just

3153
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,280
have very humble

3154
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,080
said more than 300 teams

3155
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,960
very little but

3156
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,480
I think

3157
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,280
300 teams

3158
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,080
quite a lot

3159
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,560
so

3160
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,120
I think I can put

3161
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
such a large-scale research

3162
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:49,920
so clearly

3163
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,360
I think

3164
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,680
is a very difficult thing

3165
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,320
and I think

3166
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,120
it is really clear

3167
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,800
and so interesting

3168
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,280
and

3169
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,480
the picture is so beautiful

3170
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,040
so

3171
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,240
now I will

3172
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,880
play this Q&A time

3173
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,360
so that

3174
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,320
everyone can

3175
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,520
freely discuss

3176
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,640
and ask questions

3177
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,000
that

3178
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,360
everyone is like just the same

3179
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,240
is that you can

3180
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,640
unmute your own

3181
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:06,960
that

3182
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,400
audio

3183
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,640
directly ask the question

3184
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,200
thank you Yizi

3185
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,560
thank you

3186
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,040
that

3187
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,440
Gao Xian to vote a question

3188
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,880
this is

3189
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,160
good

3190
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,440
this is actually my first

3191
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,320
model is

3192
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,400
particularly interested

3193
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,720
course the second is also very interesting

3194
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,080
because it is

3195
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,160
talking about stability

3196
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,680
but I think

3197
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,400
your first model

3198
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:30,720
is that

3199
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,440
in fact, you have talked about

3200
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:31,800
a

3201
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,320
conclusion

3202
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,960
you say

3203
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:34,800
that

3204
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,600

3207
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,240

3210
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,840
is

3211
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,040
no prediction effect

3212
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,440
but I

3213
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,000
look at

3214
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,880
your this

3215
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,240
what is this called

3216
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:44,800
trusty

3217
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,440
?

3218
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:45,640
the

00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,320
model

3220
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,080
you do not seem

3221
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,400
that you do not seem to use

3222
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:49,880
affect

3223
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,640

3224
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,000

3225
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,600
readiness

3226
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:51,840
you want

3227
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,200
because

3228
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,800
I put

3229
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,360
you this

3230
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,760
think of

3231
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:53,920
that

3232
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,280
structural

3236
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,120
that is behind

3237
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,480

3238
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:56,760
circles

3239
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,280
I treat it as

3240
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,600
random

3241
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,320
variable

3242
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:58,600
then I

3243
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,000
want to say

3244
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,320
your

3245
00:53:59,320 --> 00:53:59,800
you do not seem to

3246
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,560
go to pull

3247
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,000
affect

3248
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,680

3249
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,000

3251
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,200
and

3252
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,720
a little curious

3253
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:03,960
you this

3254
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,760
conclusion is

3255
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,000
how to come

3256
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,320
is

3257
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,720
I

3258
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,240
is not I

3259
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,640
for this

3260
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:07,880
model

3261
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,040
did not

00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,440

3263
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:08,840
did not

3264
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,240
understand

3265
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,720
clearly

3266
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,040
no no no

3267
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,720
I think you look very

3268
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,160
careful

3269
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,000
so you mean

3270
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,360
this

3271
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,680
path

3272
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,280
did not

3273
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,680

3275
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,960
be pulled up

3276
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,120
I can not see

3277
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,680
your arrow

3278
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,040
now

3279
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,520
can

3280
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,600
this is your

3281
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,120
affect

3282
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,200
so you

3283
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,680
must

3284
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,320
from A2

3285
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:25,720

3286
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,280
readiness

3287
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,480
because I

3288
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,000
originally thought

3289
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,560
you said

3290
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,200
because your

3291
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:28,440
your

3292
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:28,800
following

3293
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,080
conclusion

3294
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,280
above

3295
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,600

3296
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:29,760

3301
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:31,640
so I

3302
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:31,880
originally

3303
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,160
expected

3304
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,480
you should

3305
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:32,840
pull

3306
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,040

3317

originally

3319
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,120
expected

3320
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,360
you this

3321
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,640
sentence

3322
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:41,960
should be

3323
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,640

a line

3328
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,040
then

3329
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,200
to

3330
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,640
predict

00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,200

I

3335
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,320
understand

3336
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,360
I think

3337
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,600
this

3338
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:51,960
model

3339
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,520
it is

3340
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:52,960
put

3341
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,680
three variables

3342
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:54,880
and then

3343
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,360
pull

3344
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,600
out

3345
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,080
up

3346
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,880
so it is

3347
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,800
not like

3348
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,280
SEM

3349
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,520
it is

3350
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,600
pull it up

3351
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,160
and then

3352
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:00,960
these

3353
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,400
factors

3354
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
they are

3355
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,680

3356
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,240
independent

3357
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,560
so it

3358
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:03,920
does not

3359
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,360

00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,080

3362
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:06,960
it

3363
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,400
I

3364
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,120
I will write

3368
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,200

unique

3373
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,520
impact

3374
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,640
is because

3375
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:14,760
this

3376
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,040

3382
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,360

only affect

00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,160

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:22,560

3397
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,160
so

3398
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,080
can explain

3399
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,480

3400
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:28,840

is clear

3412
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,440
oh

3413
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:40,840
understand

3414
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,000
so

3415
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,560
you actually

3416
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,200
refer to

3417
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,600
special

3418
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,040
is

3419
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:43,520
gene

3420
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,040
performance

3421
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,200
ah

3422
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:44,800
gene

3423
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,920
part of the

3424
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,000
explanation

3425
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,520
is not actually

3426
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,800
the whole

3427
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,520
affect

3428
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:47,600
is

3429
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:47,800
this

3430
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,080
meaning

3431
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,360
right

3432
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,840
understand

3433
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,240
understand

3434
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,600
and then

3435
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:54,840
I

3436
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,360
also

3437
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,640
if you do not have

3438
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,640
a question

3439
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,120
then I will continue to ask you

3440
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,920
is that I am

3441
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,200
very interested

3442
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,680
in your first video

3443
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,760
or the next video

3444
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,240
is

3445
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,560
that

3446
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,080
I seem to see

3447
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,920
that you have a lot of

3448
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,200
BART

3449
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,840
and then go to see

3450
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,400
that gene

3451
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,000
explanation

3452
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,920
this thing

3453
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,400
and then

3454
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,120
is

3455
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,040
a twin

3456
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,360
ah

3457
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:10,760
this

3458
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,040
this

3459
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,800
that BART

3460
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,360
is not

3461
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,720
that

3462
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,560
um

3463
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,200
on another

3464
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,800
BART

3465
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,080
is

3466
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,800
related to

3467
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,360
that

3468
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:16,880
is

3469
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,640
to feel

3470
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:17,960
up

3471
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,400
I directly

3472
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:18,920
from that

3473
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,400
point of view

3474
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:19,920
feel

3475
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,400
right

3476
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,400
ah

3477
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:21,920
ah

3478
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
temperament

3479
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,440
temperament

3480
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,760
I guess

3481
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,120
we are at an

3482
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,120
estimate

3483
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,560
right

3484
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:25,840
and then

3485
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,040
I

3486
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,240
from

3487
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,360
your

3488
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:26,760
another

3489
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,080
picture

3490
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,800
I feel

3491
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,480
is

3492
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,440
ah

3493
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:29,840
especially

3494
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:29,960
is

3495
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,400
AFET

3496
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,760
is

3497
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,320
there a

3498
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,600
special

3499
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,800
strong

3500
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,200
gene prediction effect

3501
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,560
compared to

3502
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,040
other

3503
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,000
like what

3504
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,480
ah

3505
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,120
text

3506
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,760
orientation

3507
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,080
I

3508
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,400
I guess

3509
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,560
this is actually

3510
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,120
inhibitory

3511
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,520
control

3512
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,280
of a kind

3513
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:42,680
I do not know

3514
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,600
I am

3515
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,880
not familiar with this

3516
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,280
so feel

3517
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:45,560
it seems

3518
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:45,880
should be

3519
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,120
self-regulation

3520
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:47,440
a

3521
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,280
phenomenon

3522
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,560
so I

3523
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,760
actually

3524
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,600
for

3525
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,080
this result

3526
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,600
quite

3527
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,120
curious

3528
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,840
why

3529
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,800
this self-regulation

3530
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,280
this text

3531
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:54,960
orientation

3532
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,960
it is actually

3533
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,560
no gene

3534
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,440
prediction effect

3535
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,760
ah

3536
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,160
no gene

3537
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:00,840
can explain

3538
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,240
because the place

3539
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:01,840
related to

3540
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,600
relatively low

3541
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,920
than AFET

3542
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,320
ah

3543
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:04,680
than

3544
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:04,920
prediction

3545
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,760
still low

3546
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,440
so I am quite curious

3547
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:06,800
that

3548
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,160
your

3549
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:07,680
explanation of

3550
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,640
that

3551
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,480
method

3552
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,520
I think this approach

3553
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,600
quite interesting

3554
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,160
well

3555
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,280
if AFET

3556
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,080
I just

3557
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,800
first thought

3558
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
is that it can actually

3559
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,240
from

3560
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,640
our

3561
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:19,840
ah

3562
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,480
blah blah blah

3563
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,280
we do not know how to see

3564
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,600
animation is really a bit of trouble

3565
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:23,960
is

3566
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,680
because you can

3567
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,280
indeed see

3568
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,840
it in addition to

3569
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,800
A3 this factor

3570
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,840
to explain AFET

3571
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,240
it has its own independent

3572
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:29,680
equivalent to

3573
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,880
it seems to have two

3574
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,760
genetic factors

3575
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,280
to explain AFET

3576
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,640
so

3577
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,440
I would think

3578
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,360
we see in AFET

3579
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,080
relatively high

3580
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,480
that

3581
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,160
heritability

3582
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,680
is quite reasonable

3583
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,360
but

3584
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,040
talk about

3585
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,480
why

3586
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
task orientation

3587
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,240
its

3588
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,840
ah

3589
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,720
gene

3590
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,600
ratio looks

3591
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,240
not very high

3592
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,560
I think

3593
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,520
this is very interesting

3594
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,040
I have not thought about this issue

3595
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,040
I want to plug in

3596
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,960
because you just talked about that

3597
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,680
Charles

3598
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,520
I will not read

3599
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,960
Charles

3600
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,920
Ferski

3601
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,160
of that model

3602
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,960
is good

3603
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,640
that model

3604
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,240
is

3605
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,000
you

3606
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,040
if you put that order

3607
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,720
transferred

3608
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,280
you put

3609
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,560
ah

3610
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,920
I can look at the next picture

3611
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,760
you put that

3612
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,360
task

3613
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,680
ah

3614
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,560
task orientation

3615
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,160
and AFET

3616
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,400
two

3617
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,320
contrast

3618
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,720
in fact, there will be similar things

3619
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,640
because it is actually

3620
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,280
put

3621
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:13,760
that

3622
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,400
for example, A3

3623
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,120
you can also put

3624
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,040
predict

3625
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,760
task

3626
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,320
AFET

3627
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,040
ah

3628
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,160
school readiness

3629
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,880
and A2

3630
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,120
only predict

3631
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,840
task

3632
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,920
orientation

3633
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,720
so it can actually

3634
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,240
it is just a partial out

3635
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,880
is to pull it

3636
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,680
FERS process only

3637
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,920
so in fact, I look back

3638
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,600
it seems

3639
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,800
I am still very confused

3640
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,560
why

3641
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,400
task orientation

3642
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,080
so

3643
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,760
I think

3644
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,920
it should be a pretty

3645
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
gene

3646
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,560
thing

3647
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,400
is self-adjustment

3648
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,440
compared to AFET

3649
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:38,600
ah

3650
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,880
I do not dare to say

3651
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,480
I do not

3652
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:40,760
just

3653
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,320
in short, I think

3654
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,480
it should also have

3655
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,600
a lot of

3656
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,920
gene performance

3657
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,560
but from just

3658
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,280
your picture

3659
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,000
from your bar

3660
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,480
you can clearly see that

3661
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,400
it seems that the gene

3662
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:49,920
that performance

3663
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,360
is particularly low

3664
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,000
that I do not know

3665
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,440
is not because you

3666
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,120
now this child

3667
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,080
only three years old

3668
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,680
because the child

3669
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,320
is probably around two years old

3670
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,280
his

3671
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,640
self-regulation

3672
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,440
will be more

3673
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,640
formal

3674
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,480
I do not know if it is because of the dissection

3675
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,120
but I think

3676
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,400
three years old

3677
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,840
in fact, it should be quite complete

3678
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,400
but I think

3679
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:04,880
I do not know if it is because

3680
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,280
he is still relatively young

3681
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,080
so

3682
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,760
self-regulation

3683
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,640
has not been completely

3684
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,280
really

3685
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,360
good

3686
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,240
test

3687
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:11,880
and so on

3688
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,480
I do not know

3689
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,440
I do not know what your explanation

3690
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,040
will be

3691
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,560
well

3692
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,400
I think

3693
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:17,920
it is interesting

3694
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,680
I will answer it one by one

3695
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,560
I think the first question

3696
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,080
is a very expert question

3697
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,120
is about the model

3698
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,720
how to put those items

3699
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,120
indeed

3700
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,600
if you want to calculate some

3701
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,200
is that you finally

3702
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,800
pull out of the thing

3703
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,640
you do not care how to put

3704
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,480
calculated

3705
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,400
estimated heritability

3706
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,440
will be the same

3707
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:32,920
but

3708
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,840
we will put here

3709
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,480
the reason is because

3710
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,600
past research has known

3711
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,320
task orientation

3712
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,120
and score readiness

3713
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,360
are related

3714
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,000
so that

3715
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,080
it is actually not a

3716
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,400
particularly interesting phenomenon

3717
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,800
that we are interested in is

3718
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,480
affect and score readiness

3719
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,520
they will not actually have

3720
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,480
a unique

3721
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,400
score readiness

3722
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,280
related

3723
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,560
so we put it in the second

3724
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,240
that is to say

3725
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,000
if these two

3726
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,200
paths are obvious

3727
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,120
it can be said

3728
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,960
oh, we guessed

3729
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,680
that is right

3730
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,000
but we guessed wrong

3731
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,480
so

3732
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,480
its order

3733
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,520
can

3734
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
reflect some of our

3735
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,680
questions we want to ask

3736
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,240
then

3737
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:01,840
score readiness

3738
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,560
put at the end

3739
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,320
means

3740
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,160
it actually

3741
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,000
we want to see

3742
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,600
unique

3743
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
for score readiness

3744
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,120
those effects

3745
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,840
because we actually

3746
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,480
really interesting

3747
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:09,880
is not the

3748
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,360
temperament

3749
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,920
we are interested in

3750
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,480
it

3751
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,880
temperament

3752
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,640
and score readiness

3753
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,160
related

3754
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,640
with

3755
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,280
score readiness

3756
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,680
itself

3757
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:14,880
in the end

3758
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,240
what

3759
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,920
special

3760
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,360
effect

3761
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,360
like this

3762
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,640
so

3763
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:18,920
that is

3764
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,120
the order of the model

3765
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,120
will

3766
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,680
affect

3767
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,640
how we want

3768
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,520
to be more

3769
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,280
effective

3770
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,000
and convenient

3771
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,520
to explain this model

3772
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,440
then

3773
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,280
I think

3774
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,240
that

3775
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,640
question of heritability

3776
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,680
can look at

3777
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,320
this path

3778
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,880
so we can see here

3779
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,120
that is

3780
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,600
this path

3781
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,080
square

3782
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:36,640
will be its

3783
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,480
heritability

3784
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:37,720
so

3785
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,120
here

3786
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,880
calculated

3787
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,240
actually

3788
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:39,960
gene can explain

3789
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,840
about 40%

3790
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
variance

3791
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:43,960
for

3792
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,960
task orientation

3793
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:46,880
so

3794
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,360
actually

3795
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,880
not particularly

3796
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,400
low

3797
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,840
although

3798
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,360
in the

3799
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:49,880
bar graph

3800
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,360
inside

3801
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:50,920
does not look

3802
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,440
high

3803
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:51,920
but

3804
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,440
it is actually

3805
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:52,960
explained

3806
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,960
about 40%

3807
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,960
right

3808
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,440
I'm here

3809
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
to interrupt

3810
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,440
as a host

3811
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
is

3812
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
the time factor

3813
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
because I think

3814
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
there should be

3815
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
some later

3816
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
is

3817
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
more detailed discussion

3818
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
that

3819
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
because I want to say

3820
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,440
that we are now

3821
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,440
recording

3822
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
that do not know

3823
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
if it can be a little bit

3824
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,440
interrupted discussion here

3825
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,440
and then I want

3826
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
as a host

3827
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
is to ask

3828
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,520
that

3829
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,520
I do not know

3830
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,520
in today's

3831
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
speech

3832
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,520
is now here

3833
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,520
to a paragraph

3834
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
you have anything

3835
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
that you know

3836
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,520
in addition to just

3837
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
the last slide

3838
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,520
of take home

3839
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,520
message

3840
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
you have anything

3841
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,520
that is more personal

3842
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,520
a few words of

3843
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
personality

3844
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
want to talk to

3845
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,520
Project Tara

3846
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,520
for example,

3847
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,520
after listening to

3848
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,520
the audience

3849
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,520
of this video

3850
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,520
can share

3851
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,520
that

3852
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
may be

3853
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
after you say

3854
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,520
a few words

3855
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,520
I will stop recording

3856
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,520
here first

3857
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
and then with us

3858
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
live

3859
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
or future audience

3860
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,600
can share

3861
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
some of you

3862
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,600
do this

3863
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,600
very interesting research

3864
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,600
and I think

3865
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
it is rare to study

3866
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
some of you know

3867
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,600
that is more personal

3868
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
ideas

3869
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
or something

3870
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,600
I did not expect

3871
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
this part

3872
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,600
but I think

3873
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,600
I want to say

3874
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,600
a lot of things

3875
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,600
are put in

3876
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,600
take home message

3877
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,600
inside

3878
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,600
so everyone

3879
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
is if there are

3880
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,600
other questions

3881
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,600
can write to contact me

3882
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600

3888
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,680
that should be

3889
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,680
here

3890
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680

3891
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680

3893
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,680

3894
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,680

3895
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,680
