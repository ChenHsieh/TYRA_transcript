00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, I am the host of today's Taira Talk on September 18th, Hong Shih-an.

00:13.000 --> 00:26.000
We are very happy to invite the Sky in the World comedy science team to share with you the spirit of science communication.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.000
Like Taira, the comedy science team is made up of doctoral students or post-doctoral students.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
They also want to promote the concept of science.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
However, what is different from Taira is that they are more towards the public,

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
and they will share their life from a scientific perspective.

00:57.000 --> 01:11.000
I have personally listened to their podcasts several times, and I think what they say is very close to the life of a graduate student.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I highly recommend everyone to listen to their podcasts.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
They also run a clubhouse.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
Without further ado, let's get into today's topic, the spirit of science communication.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Wallace, we'll leave it to you now.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Okay, sure.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
The stage is yours.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
What?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, so I'm going to share my screen now.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Everyone has prepared a video.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Let me know if you can see it.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Yes.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Okay.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Thank you, Shih-an, for the introduction.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I'm one of the editors of the comedy science team.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I'm the screenwriter.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm very happy to have this opportunity to talk to you about science communication.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Seeing today's title, the spirit of science communication,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
you may have a question.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
What is the difference between science communication and science?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Why do we need the title of science communication?

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Let's share our thoughts with you in the next hour.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Welcome to share your opinions.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Okay, he can't go to the next page.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay, here we go.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm Liu Yuru.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm the founder and editor of Sky Interworld.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
My nickname is Wall, so you can call me Wall Editor.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
My English name is Wallace.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It's a long name, I know.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Sky Interworld started as a podcast and blog in 2006.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It's kind of like my personal thing.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I was originally alone.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
When I went to the UK to study,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I was busy writing my thesis.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
It's been a while since then.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I came back to Taiwan in 2019.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I joined the overseas talent bridge project called LIFT.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I met a lot of super cool overseas Taiwanese,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
including Xiao Ji, Dou Dou, CBN, and so on.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So did Adam.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
The most important thing is that I found this group of friends.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
We are willing to make an impact

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
and do something for Taiwan.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Let's reopen the Sky Interworld podcast.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
For more than a year,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
we've been running Facebook, Instagram,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
podcasts, and Clubhouse events on Sky Interworld.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
We're very active on these platforms.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We have a lot of articles.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
We have a podcast every week.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
We also have a book club every month on Clubhouse.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
We also have other editors

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
coming to play with us.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
We currently have eight permanent editors,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
including myself.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I'll be sharing with you later

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Xiao Ji, CBN, CS, CBN, and Dou Dou.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Let me tell you about your locations.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Xiao Ji is in Milan, Italy.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
CS is in the east coast of the United States.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Dou Dou is in Paris, France.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Adam is in the west coast of the United States.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
CBN is in Switzerland.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Alan is in the north of Taiwan.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
CBN is in the Czech Republic.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Most of us are postdoctoral researchers

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
or teachers at school.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Our articles are also posted

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
on different platforms.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
For example, Science News,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
National Daily, and World News.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I don't know why World News likes us.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Some of these events

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
have attracted a lot of attention.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Some people are willing to jump in

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and join us.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
For example,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
a marine biologist

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
at the coast of Maryland.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
He is a senior

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
in the US marine policy.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
He is a senior.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
A British citizen

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
will also join us

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
at Clubhouse.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Sometimes he will join our recording.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Last week,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Tyra gave a talk.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
She is a senior

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
in the Netherlands.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
She is a senior in higher education.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
She is also a very important

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
source of advice and help.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
The article and podcast

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
published by Sky in the World

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
are all from academic journals.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The content of the podcast

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
includes food and science,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
interviews with people

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
who care about cancer development,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
a doctor's seminar

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
for researchers,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
and a fitness seminar

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
for everyone's health.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Adam is the host.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
The content of the article

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
includes interesting research,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
academic work,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
environmental-related reports,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
and support for cancer development in academia.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
The purpose of the article

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
is to promote the scientific logic

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and spirit of the article

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
through humor.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The translation of the article

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
will be different.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
For example,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Michael Bonkowski

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
will be translated as

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Michael Collision Driver.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Elizabeth Beak

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
will be translated as

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Elizabeth Beak.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The purpose of the article

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
is to promote

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
the scientific logic

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and spirit of the article

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
through humor.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
In addition,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
we hope that

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
everyone will pay attention

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
to the article.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Sometimes it will be dissed,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
sometimes it will be praised.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
The reaction is a bit two-dimensional,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
but at the same time,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
it also creates a topic.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
The purpose of the article

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
is to promote

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
the scientific logic

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
and spirit of the article

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
through humor.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
The purpose of the article

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
is to promote

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
the scientific logic

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and spirit of the article

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
through humor.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
We do not make any profit

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
by doing this.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Of course,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
those who support us

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
will be very happy.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
But we do not make any profit

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
by doing this.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Let's start with

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
the history of science.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
In January 1665,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
the French emperor Louis XIV

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
was called Colbert.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
In order to honor

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
the Sun King,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
he published the first

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
academic journal,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
which you can see

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
in the upper left corner.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Its translation is

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
called The Scholar's Journal.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
In March of the same year,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
the Royal Academy of Sciences

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
also began a report on natural science.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It was the beginning of

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
scientific dissemination,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
the beginning of scientific journals.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
In the scientific field

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
of scientists,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
they began to communicate

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
with each other.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
At that time,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
in Europe in the 17th century,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
science was already developed

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
in the Roman era.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
There was no need

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
to challenge existing knowledge.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Therefore,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
many scientific experiments

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and new ideas

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
came from science

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
as an entertainment activity

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
for the rich.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Why do we need money?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Look at the picture

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
below,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
the boy and the girl.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
The girl is his wife.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
The experiment equipment

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
on the table in front

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
is made of glass.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
The glass is so big

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
that it blows into

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
various strange shapes.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
At that time,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
it was very expensive,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
so only the upper class

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
would play with it.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Of course,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
such scientific dissemination

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
was only limited to

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
the upper class.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
However,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
with the rapid development of science,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
science is no longer

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
just an entertainment activity

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
for the rich.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It will become a factor

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
that affects life in all aspects.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
From the change of people's lifestyle

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
to the formation of public policy,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
modern people need

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
scientific logic and concepts

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
to avoid becoming a bright world

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
that leads everyone

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
to become scientific journalists.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
In Taiwan,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
there is no such thing.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
When you hear the word

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
science,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
people think it's nonsense.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
For example,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
people are waiting

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
to hear some useless

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
British research.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I also watched the ad

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
of Vogue magazine.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I was very curious

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
about the science of fashion.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
When I was teaching Vogue,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I thought

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
the word science

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
had been misused.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
At that time,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I thought I should buy

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
a new dictionary

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
to see if the definition

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
of science had changed.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Because science

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
had been distorted,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
several editors

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
from Sky Inner World

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
decided to disseminate

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
the concept of scientific life

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
in our lab

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
through various

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
social media platforms

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
to attract more

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
listeners.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
At the same time,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
we also care about

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
friends in the academic circle

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and hope to share

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
the opinions of the editors

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
to help more friends

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
who are interested

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
in science and want to

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
learn more about

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
the science of comedy.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Hi, everyone.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm Xiao-Ji.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
First of all,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
if we want to make

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
science successful,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
we need to let the general public

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
know what PhD is.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
We need to know

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
what PhD is.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
This is an introduction

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
from a professor in the US,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
who introduces PhDs

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
every autumn.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I think this picture

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
is very interesting.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I think many people have seen it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Let's recall it.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
First of all,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
you see a circle.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
This circle represents

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
the knowledge of all humans.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Next.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You see a blue dot in the middle.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
This is where we started

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
to learn about the world

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
We are in the middle.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Next.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
As we grow up,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
we learn more and more knowledge.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
From elementary school,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
high school, and university

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
to the university,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
we start to have a specialization.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Our knowledge starts to go in a certain direction.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
After the specialization,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
we may have read a master's degree.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Finally, we decide to

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
get a PhD.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
As our knowledge goes forward,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
we have to face

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
the unknown.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
As we face the unknown,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
we work hard

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
to study

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
what others don't know.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
After many years of struggle,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
we finally have a new discovery.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Next.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
As we move forward,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
the knowledge of all humans

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
takes a small step.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
This small step is

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
our life experience.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Next.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
From our perspective,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
we stand here

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and look at

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
where the knowledge of all humans

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
is.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I think I have made

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a big step.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Next.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
When we look back,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
we realize that

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
the knowledge of all humans

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
is very small.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So, the PhD is

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
right.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
We may call it

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Psychology.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I don't like the name.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
On the other hand,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
we are PhDs

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
because

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
we learned

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
how to

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
face the unknown systematically

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
learn new knowledge.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
We can apply

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
this method

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
to other areas.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Even if we make a breakthrough,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
we can apply this method

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
to other areas.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
We must remember this.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
If we forget that

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
what we learned is not only professional knowledge,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
but also a whole set of research methods,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
we will become advanced technicians.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
We are just technicians

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
who know how to operate

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
strange machines.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Next.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
When we do research,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
we need to face the unknown.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
We often say that we need to learn the ivory tower.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
It seems that what we do

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
has nothing to do with everyday life.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Of course, we need to learn the ivory tower,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
but why is it there?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It makes sense.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Next.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
When we face the unknown,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
no one knows the answer.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
How can we find the answer?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
We can only make assumptions.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
We always make assumptions

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and try to prove it.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
We always end up

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
at the bottom of the theory.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Even if we can prove it,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
we still need to apply it in our daily life.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
There is a big difference between theory and reality.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
For example,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I am doing diagnostic research.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
We often say that

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
early diagnosis means early treatment.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Early diagnosis is a great topic.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I made a result.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
This result

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
is a simple

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
example.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
A week before a patient caught a cold,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I knew he had a cold.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
So I went to my boss.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Boss,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I found something.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
A week before a patient caught a cold,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I knew he would have a cold next week.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I can tell him

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
if he will have a cold next week.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
My boss is a doctor.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
He told me that

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
it is useless.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
What if I have a cold next week?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I said yes.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
There is a big difference between theory and reality.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Theoretically, early diagnosis

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
is a good thing.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
But when we apply it,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
there are more considerations.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Next slide.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Second,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
we want to quantify science.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
In order to quantify science,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
we need a set of tools

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
to tell us the final result.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
This set of tools is statistics.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Statistics is a very powerful tool.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But there is a limitation.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
First,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
when we do research,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
we can't

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
study everyone.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
For example,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
if I want to study a patient,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I can't study all the patients in the world.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
We may see a scientific article

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
about a breakthrough in cancer treatment.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
We successfully treated this cancer.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
If you read that article,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
they successfully treated five patients.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Can these five patients

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
represent all the cancer patients in the world?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This is the sample

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
we got today.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Can the sample represent

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
the entire population?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Another example is

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
the presidential election.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Before the presidential election,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
there were many polling stations.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Polling is a different

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
example of the same country.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
This is the sample.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
If the voters

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
support this candidate,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
the result will be different.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Today,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
the first point of statistics

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
is whether the sample can

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
reflect the reality of the society.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
The second point of statistics is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
when we do scientific research,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
we can see the difference in statistics.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
In short,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
it tells you that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
the result is very likely to be right.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
In other words,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
there must be a possibility that the result is wrong.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Even if we

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
make a very beautiful result,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
there is no way

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
to be 100% sure

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
that the result is right.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
In the development stage of science,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
the key point is that

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
we can't know

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
whether we are right or wrong.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So when do we know

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
the result is right?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
We have to wait

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
for different scientists

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
from all over the world

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
to test the result

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
in different ways

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
to make sure

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
that the result is right.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
At this point,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
we can apply the results

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
to our daily lives.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
So today,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
when we face the unknown

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
in front of the academic circle,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
what we do

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
will really make a difference in our lives.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Most of the things

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
we do

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
cannot be applied

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
to our daily lives in an instant.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But when we finally

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
make a mature decision

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
to apply it to our daily lives,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
we have to promote it to the public.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Let's move on to the next slide.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Today, we published an academic article.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
What do you think

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
about it?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
First of all,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
academic articles require

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
very precise writing.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So today,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
the sentence must be clear.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
We can go back and read the paper

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and still can't find the sentence.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The sentence is still in English.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
When you translate it into Chinese,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
it's even more difficult to understand.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But academic articles require accuracy.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
You really can't delete a single word.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
So it's a very painful reading experience

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
for most people.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Second,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
academic articles have too many

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
special names and are very long.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So we start to abbreviate.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I don't even know

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
whether it's an abbreviation

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
or an abbreviation.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
So for most people,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
it's really hard to remember.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Third,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
as I said,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
when we write an article,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
it may be overturned.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Even if the probability is very low,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
the probability that I wrote

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
1% or 0.1% is not correct.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I can't speak slowly.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
So we usually end up

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
writing that our research results

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
support the theory of A very much.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But at the same time,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
B and C may also be correct.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
At the same time,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
we do not rule out the possibility

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
that D is also correct.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
So basically,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
these three sentences sum up.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
In short,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
if you see it,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
you don't understand it.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
If we let scholars

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
directly talk to the public,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
there will be a second question.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
First,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
when we talk about science,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
we become scholars.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Everything must be very clear.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Everything must be very correct.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
So even the words we say

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
are almost the same as

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
the paper we wrote.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
So the public may not understand

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
what they see or hear.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
In fact, the level of understanding

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
has not improved.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The second question is

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
The second question is

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Captain

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Captain

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
We have technical issues.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
We have technical issues.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The second question is

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
because we are learning

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
science today,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
it teaches us not to criticize.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
So as long as we hear something wrong,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
we immediately want to point it out.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We are trained to ask questions

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
that are very clear and correct.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Just like we talked about

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
in a previous podcast,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
many people

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
start to get red

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
after eating seafood porridge.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Many people say they are allergic.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
But in some cases,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
they are actually poisoned, not allergic.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
So you can imagine

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
that a friend came to me and said,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Xiaoxi, I just ate seafood porridge

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
and I'm allergic to red.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
What should I do?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
The point of this question is

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
But when my scholar soul

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
came up, I heard this question,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I just wanted to tell him that

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
you are not allergic, you are poisoned.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
This is very accurate and important to me.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
But this is not helpful

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
to the people who are asking for answers today.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
So I think

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
when we are in contact with ordinary people,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
we must suppress our scholar soul.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We have to be able to accept

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
that maybe this question is very broad

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
and not so accurate,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
but it doesn't matter.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
If we get the information

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
he wants to know today,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
can we give him a simple

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
take-home message after the explanation?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
After listening to a bunch of academic analysis,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
he can still have a very clear

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
1, 2, 3 to follow.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And then

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
if we find out today

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
that he asked this question too broadly

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and couldn't answer it,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
this is usually the case.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Can we explain to him

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
how complicated this question is

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
so that the answer is not so easy?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So next time

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
if he encounters any false information,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
just tell him so simply.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Maybe he can understand

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
that it's not that easy.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Because

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
this may not be true.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Because I know this thing is very difficult.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So in the end,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
when we want to pass science to the general public,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
the most important thing is

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
the skill of speaking and the art of communication.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
This is actually very lacking

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
in our doctoral training.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But in fact,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
in the future,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
it is very important in life.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
This kind of communication is not just internal.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
We communicate with people in our lab,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
with scholars in our field,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
with scholars in other fields,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and even with the general public.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
We all have different skills of communication.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
There are even those above and those below.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I found something today.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
How do I convince my boss?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
He must support me.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
In addition to my professional skills,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I also need to learn

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
the rules of science.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
How do I pass this spirit

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
to the next generation?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So in the end, the most important thing is communication.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Speaking of communication,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
let's give the floor to CS.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Have you heard my voice?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Yes.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I don't know how.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Okay.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
CS can't come today.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
He has a recording.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I'll play it here.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I'm going to share

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
with you

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
the starting point

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
of Sky in the World.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I'll share with you

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
the starting point of Sky in the World.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Sky in the World

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
has many hosts.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Everyone is in

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
almost different countries,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
even different time zones.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Everyone has a different background.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
In the interview

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
we invited,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
in the interview

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
we invited

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
very experienced

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
professors

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
who are about

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
the same age as us,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
but very good at teaching.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
We also found a position

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
for seniors

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
who are

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
older than us.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Sometimes

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
through

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Facebook fan page,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
we also met

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
people who asked

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
if they should study in a PhD program.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Things like that.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
This kind of

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
horizontal communication

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
between peers

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and seniors

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
is a kind of

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
horizontal communication.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
How do we

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
coordinate?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
At the beginning of the sharing,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm going to ask

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
this question first.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It's on PowerPoint.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
1 plus 1.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
What's the answer

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
to this 1 plus 1?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Some people might think it's 2,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
a very simple number.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Some people might think it's 2.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Or some people might think

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
1 drop of water plus 1 drop of water

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
is a big number.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Or 1 mouse plus 1 mouse

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
is a bunch of mice.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
There are many answers.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
When I first

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
joined Sky and World,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
when faced with some questions,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
my reaction was

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
2.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's very certain.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
There's no room for compromise.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
In this world,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
2 is the only standard answer.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Then,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I realized

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
that other hosts

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
have a different

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
reaction from me.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Why can they

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
ask questions

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
to so many people?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Today,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I started to

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
see how they

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
ask questions.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I found one thing

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
different from my experience.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
What they think

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
is the connection

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
between their profession

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
and the question.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Or,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
what's the connection

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
between their life

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and the question

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
we're going to discuss?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's a very special way.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
When I started

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
to think in this direction,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
when I removed

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
the standard answer frame

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
to the scientific question,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I also removed

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
the frame

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
from myself.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I stopped thinking

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
about the standard answer

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
or the pathway

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
or mechanism

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
it should follow.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I stopped

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
thinking

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
in a certain way.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I also removed

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
the frame

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
from others.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I think

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
they should

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
think in the same way.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
But I started

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
to accept,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
to discover,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
to feel

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
their way of thinking.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I found that

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
the question became so interesting.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
The question became so interesting.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
In all sciences,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
we introduce

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
history,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
chemistry,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
immunology,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
or brain science.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
We often introduce

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
very special foods

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
that people have never thought of.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
We want

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the audience

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
to feel

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
the same connection

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
between

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
their favorite

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
history,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
science,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
or

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
the life

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
they have never thought of.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Some people

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
like

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
special things.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It sounds

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
like

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
we can't find the answer.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
But if we

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
find it,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
it will be very rich.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
This is what I want to say.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
We should remove the frame.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
We should remove

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
the frame

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
that has been

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
in the academic circle

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
for a long time.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
We should think

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
how to connect

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
the theme.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
We should

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
think through

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
other people's questions

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and thoughts.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Why don't I have

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
other thoughts?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
This kind of thought

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
is very good.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
But science is a

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
subject that

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
we can think about

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
from various angles.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
We should

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
communicate with each other

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
and

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
remove the frame.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
What about the audience?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
When we face

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
many seniors

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
or

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
when we become

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
their seniors,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
do we

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
remove the frame?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Of course we do.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
We remove the frame

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
because

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
there is

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
a gap between us.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Some people are up, some people are down.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Sometimes we are down, others are up.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Sometimes we become

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
other people's seniors.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Some people are up, some people are down.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
In this case,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
how should we

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
face the audience?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Do we

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
have to listen to

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
the seniors?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Do we have to

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
ask questions

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
or

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
ask our questions?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
If we keep doing this,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
we can't do the program.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
We can't record the program.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
We can't give a speech,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
but we can't interview.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
What we did

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
was

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
to remove

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
the focus

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
from the position

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
and

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
move to

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the topic we wanted to discuss.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Whether it's a

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
science or

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
an interview,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
the topic is neutral.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
When we focus

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
on these issues,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
we can jump

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
out of the

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
top-to-bottom

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
discuss a topic,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
instead of

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
looking at what the elders

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
want to say to us.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
It's not the same.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
We can still learn

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
from the elders

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
in the interview.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
When we discuss

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
with the elders,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
we can

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
also learn from them.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
However,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
learning is not

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
about who

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
should learn, who should listen,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
who should share, who should listen.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Instead,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
this topic

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
is very interesting.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Let's think about

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
the starting point

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
for different people.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
What would it look like?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
In the interview,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
we often

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
discuss

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
the topic

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
as

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
it sounds

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
neutral.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
However,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
it can be

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
exciting.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
In this case,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
we can learn

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
how to

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
understand

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
the atmosphere

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
and the process.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
The most important thing

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
is that

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
we can

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
discuss

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
the topic

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
first.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Then,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
we can

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
focus on

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
the topic.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
This is what I want to share

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
with you today.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Actually,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
we have heard about

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
frameworks.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Frameworks often

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
appear in our life.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I want to

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
remind you

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
that

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
we should

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
learn from

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
the elders.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Now,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
let's welcome

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Ren.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I want to

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
remind you

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
that

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
we should

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
learn from

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
the elders.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I want to

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
remind you

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
that

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
we should

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
learn from

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the elders.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I am a health-related

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
scientist.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I am doing research

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
on sports.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
We all know

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
that

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
it is not

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
a matter of

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
one or two days.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Many scholars

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
are thinking about

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
how to

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
deal with

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
death.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
This is my

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
evidence-based research.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
However,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
it does not

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
happen naturally.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I am from

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
the US.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
NIH

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
did not mention

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
clinical trial.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
From T0 to

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
T3 and T4,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
it is not

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
a matter of

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
one or two days.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I want to

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
remind you

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
that

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
it is not

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
a matter of

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
one or two days.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I want to

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
remind you

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
that

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
it is not

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
a matter of

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
one or two days.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I want to

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
remind you

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
that

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
it is not

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
a matter of

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
one or two days.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I want to

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
remind you

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
that

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
it is not

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
a matter of

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
one or two days.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I want to

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
remind you

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
that

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
it is not

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
a matter of

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
one or two days.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I want to

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
remind you

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
that

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
it is not

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
a matter of

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
one or two days.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I want to

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
remind you

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
that

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
it is not

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
a matter of

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
one or two days.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I want to

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
remind you

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
that

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
it is not

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
a matter of

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
one or two days.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I want to

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
remind you

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
that

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
it is not

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
a matter of

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
one or two days.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I want to

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
remind you

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
that

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
it is not

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
a matter of

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
one or two days.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I want to

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
remind you

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
that

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
it is not

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
a matter of

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
one or two days.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I want to

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
remind you

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
that

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
it is not

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
a matter of

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
one or two days.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I want to

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
remind you

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
that

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
it is not

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
a matter of

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
one or two days.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I want to

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
remind you

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
that

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
it is not

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
a matter of

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
one or two days.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I want to

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
remind you

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
that

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
it is not

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
a matter of

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
one or two days.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I want to

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
remind you

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
that

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
it is not

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
a matter of

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I want to

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
remind you

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
that

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
it is not

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
a matter of

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
one or two days.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I want to

I want to

I want to

remind you

I want to

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I want to

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
remind you

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000

it is not

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I want to

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
remind you

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000

I want to

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
remind you

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
that

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
it is not

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
a matter of

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
one or two days.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I want to

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
remind you

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
that

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
it is not

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
a matter of

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
one or two days.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I want to

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
remind you

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
that

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
it is not

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
a matter of

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
one or two days.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I want to

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
remind you

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
that

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
it is not

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
a matter of

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
one or two days.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I want to remind you

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
that

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
it is not

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
a matter of

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
one or two days.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I want to

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
remind you

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
that

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
it is not

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
a matter of

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
one or two days.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Before we look into

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
some of the

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
previous experiences,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
we hope

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
that we can

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
invite

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
more

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
seniors

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
to share

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
their experiences

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
and thoughts.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Later, our audience

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
may gradually shift to

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
doctors or researchers,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
researchers and employees.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
However,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
we hope that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
the public

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
will be able to

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
see and understand

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
what scientific debate

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
looks like.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I know that

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
a lot of people

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
who study literature

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
or sociology

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
think that

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
scientific debates are

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
a bit deep,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
but the jokes are funny.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I think that's enough.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I don't know if that answers

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
your question.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Is Alan speaking?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I just want to

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
add something.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Our team discussed

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
that we need people

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
with a literary background

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
or an artistic background

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
to discuss with us.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
we don't mean

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
to attack the literary community.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
They can understand

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
these scientific things.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Absolutely.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Some of the people

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
we often collaborate with,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
such as Clubhouse,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
we have invited professors

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
from the Department of Philosophy

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
at the University of Miami.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
This is a wonderful

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
field of study.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
We can get to know

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
a lot of wonderful fields

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
through this platform.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
We've never thought about

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
biotechnology or biophysics.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
We've never heard of them,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
but we've invited them

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
so that we can get to know

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
these different fields.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
This is a part of cross-communication.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Scholars from different fields

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
communicate with each other

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
through this platform.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
This is one of the things

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
we want to do.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
This platform is very free.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
In today's presentation,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
the content is very free.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You can choose a topic

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
and go home to prepare.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You don't have to say

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
what you want to say.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
It's a platform

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
you can use.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Any other questions?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I'd like to ask

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
a question about

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
what makes you feel

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
connected to the

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Department of Philosophy.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I think it's about

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
choosing a boss.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I've been thinking

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
about

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
choosing a boss.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
There was a talk

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
by Tara

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
from the Department of Chemistry

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
in Houston.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
She said

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
she had prepared

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
a talk

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
about choosing a boss.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I talked to her

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
about it.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I think

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
we all have a common conclusion

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
that choosing a boss

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
is more than 50% by luck.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You've made

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
a lot of decisions

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
along the way,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
but sometimes

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
by luck is a good decision.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I think

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
it's okay.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I feel the same way.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I think

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
the benefits of this platform

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
are quite interesting.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
First,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I want to share

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
these things

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
so that people

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
on the same path

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
can have a better reference.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I also want to tell them

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
that if you make a decision,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
it turns out that it's not a good decision

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
and it's not your problem.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It seems like

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
you have a lot of stories

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
to share.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You're welcome to join us.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Actually,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Sky in the World

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
has a good thing.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
These people

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
have a lot of connections

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
in their interpersonal relationships.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
We have some

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
internal information

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
about some

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
recruits

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
or job positions.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Editors

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
will share with each other.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
If you join our team,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
you'll hear a lot about

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
where to apply.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
My job now

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
is to introduce.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Like you said,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
sometimes you

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
accidentally throw it out.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Is there anyone

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
you know

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
who thinks it's suitable for this job?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Maybe some people

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
catch it.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Yeah.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Go ahead.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I just want to say

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
that I heard

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
the podcast

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and I felt very allergic.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
But there was a episode

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
about the clinical trial

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
and IRB.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I don't think it's right.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I really want to oppose it.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So I want to join this team

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and discuss with you.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Yeah.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
It's politically correct.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Whether it's an article

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
or a podcast,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
we welcome people

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
to make mistakes.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
We don't always

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
present our expertise.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So it might be wrong.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
If people are willing

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
to make mistakes,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
it's a discussion.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I think it's good.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I think science should be like this.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
You present it

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and we challenge it.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
We present different opinions.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I agree with what you said.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I remember

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
listening to

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
the podcast

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
about how to choose a boss.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I'm very similar to Sinda.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It's like

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
a PhD student

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
or someone who

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
used to be a PhD student

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
will have

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
an interest

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
in listening.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
If you think of

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
a topic you want to listen to,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
you can throw it away.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Or you can join

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
our PhD chat.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I have a lot of

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Facebook fans

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
who comment

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
on the topics

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
they want to hear.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
We listen to them

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and discuss them.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
If you have

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
any ideas

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
or topics

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
you think

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
are worth discussing,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
you're welcome.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
You can also

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
ask questions

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
about your daily life.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
For example,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
what is sashimi?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Why can it be eaten raw?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Or what is cooked meat?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
They can just throw it away

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
and we can

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
make food science for them.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Sounds great.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I have some

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
questions.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
How do you manage the platform?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It sounds like

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
your audience

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
is the general public.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But sometimes

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
when it comes to

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
PhD topics,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
it feels like

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
you have to be a PhD student

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
to want to listen.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
This audience

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
looks like a PhD student.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
How do you decide

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
in the middle?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
For example,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
what kind of audience

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
do you have?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Do you have a balance?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I'd like to know how you manage it.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The podcast part?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Allen, do you want to answer?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I was just kidding.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Please go ahead.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
No, I'm just stressed

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
and bored.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You can continue.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We're all funny.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
For the podcast part,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
we're quite

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
familiar with

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
the team.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
We have a LINE group.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Every week,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
once a month,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I'll organize the recording schedule.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
For example,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
we'll decide what to record

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
on a certain weekend.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
We'll decide the topic

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
we want to talk about.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
It's very simple.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
For example, food science.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
We'll throw the food on the table

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and cook it into meat.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Or, for example,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
we want to talk about

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
academic ghost stories.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We'll think about it.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Then,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
during the recording session,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
we'll have a chat

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and talk freely.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
We'll say what we want

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
to talk about.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Sometimes, the recording session

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
takes a long time.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But it's okay.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
We can edit it.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
For the audience,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
we don't have a specific

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
target audience.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
But I have

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
a separate target audience

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
for each topic.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
For example,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
for food science,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I'll talk about science.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
For doctoral studies,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I'll talk about

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
those who are on the path

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
to become a doctor.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Or those who are already

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
on the path to become a doctor.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And so on.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
For the gym,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I'll talk about

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
those who are

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
studying science.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Scientists

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
don't have much time to exercise.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But Adam will

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
tell everyone to exercise.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
So, listen to Adam's lecture

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
once a month.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
He'll tell you to exercise

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
for at least two or three days.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Just like me.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So, we'll use the theme

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
to distinguish our audience.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
What do you think,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
editors?

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I really

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
don't care about

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
these things.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I joined the team

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
because I wanted to

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
be a rock band.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I was very happy

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
to join the team.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I've learned a lot.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We're all from different backgrounds.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So, for management,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I'm the leader.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
For example,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Adam, Xiao Ji,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
they all run

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Instagram and Facebook.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So, they really

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
know

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
the behind-the-scenes

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
of the team.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Xiao Ji is amazing.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
She's the big manager

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
of our Instagram.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I've been lost lately.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I'm addicted to mobile games.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Are you still playing

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
the mobile game?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Yes, I am.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
We have to be scientific.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I've been wondering

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
if anyone is still playing

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
the mobile game.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Xiao Ji said so,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
but our Instagram

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
has almost 1,000 followers.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
It's been a long time.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
If I'm still playing,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I should have 1,000 followers

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
last month.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I've been working lately,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
so I don't have much time.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Otherwise, we would have 5,000 followers.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
At first,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
some people said

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
their social media

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
would explode

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
and 50 people would die.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We can't join.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
We don't need to buy

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
anything.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Only 10 people will come.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I'm sorry.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
It's a cold joke.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Before we started,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Jason told us

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
that Tyra's speech

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
would explode

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
sometimes.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But we haven't

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
encountered such a situation.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I saw a few viewers

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
turn on the camera.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Do you want to ask questions?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yes.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Please ask.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Hello.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I'm a student

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
at Tsinghua University.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I've been writing

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
science fiction articles

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and fan magazines.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I want to ask

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
if you want to write

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
science fiction articles

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
for the public,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
how do you write

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
so that everyone can understand?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I think what I write

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
depends on

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
what you've learned.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I want to write

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
a story,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
a fable.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
You don't need

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
to feel burdened

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
to read it.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
If you don't like science,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
you'll want to read it.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
What's your topic?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Which field do you prefer?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Animal behavior and neuroscience.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
That's so cool.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I want to read your fable.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I can't write it yet.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I think this topic

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
is easy to use.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I think we can send

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
CS and V to read it.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I'm neuroscience too.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Don't ignore me.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Xiao Ji is also

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
neuroscience.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I write more

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
in writing

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
than other editors.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
But other editors

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
also have free time.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
How to

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
make a science fiction

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
story more vivid?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Can everyone

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
say something bad about someone else?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We're recording.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Let's cut it out.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We can't add anything.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Don't add anything.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
We're not

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
doing a journal club.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
If we want to present

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
an article to the general public,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
the best way

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
is to use as many metaphors

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
as possible.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Use all kinds of metaphors

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
in everyday life.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You've already written a fable.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
That's a good metaphor.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
But sometimes

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
when I'm reading a story,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
sometimes I can't

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
connect with

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
what I want to convey.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You have to be smart

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
to read the meaning of

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
self-discipline.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I can't read poetry.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It's useless

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
to write poetry.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So I think

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
you can use

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
metaphors in everyday life

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
to describe

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
the scientific facts.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
For example,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
DNA and RNA

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
will go through

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
translation and transcription.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
You can say

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it's a translation of the past.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
There are too many

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
metaphors.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You can say

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
it's a dictionary.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You can say

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
it's a code.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You can say

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
it's a protein.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
You can use

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
all kinds of metaphors.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Because you're writing

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
about a field

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
that few people write about,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
you can use

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
innovative metaphors.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
What do you think, Xiao-jin?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You sound like a writer.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I used to be a writer.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Maybe until I was 80.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I think

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
you can use

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
metaphors

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
like Xiao-jin said.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
We have a lot of metaphors.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
The second thing I think

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
is that you can

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
use images.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Xiao-jin is good at

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
animal behavior.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It's really interesting.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
He said

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
animal behavior is like

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
two

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
ships

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
mating.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
When mating,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
the third mate

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
opened his hand.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You might think

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
it's boring.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
When we observe

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
animals, it's boring.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
When mating,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
the third mate

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
might react in a bad way.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It's boring.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
But if you think about it,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
it's like a couple

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
fighting in the park.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
They fought.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I told you to buy soy sauce,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
but you went out to date.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
When you use images,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
it becomes interesting.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Everyone can imagine it.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Everyone can understand

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
what's going on.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
When you bring it up,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
you can talk about

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
what we see in biology.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It's interesting

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
and you learn something.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's cool to share with others.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I think Xiao-jin is good

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
at using metaphors.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I run

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Sky's Instagram.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Many readers leave comments

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
on Instagram.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
They say,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
they've never thought

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
they'd understand biology

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
or science.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But it's so funny.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
After laughing,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I realized I understood.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It's touching.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
It's like

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
a virtual science.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
It's like

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
electrons,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
atoms,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
and positrons.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
It's like chemistry.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It has to be perfect.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
When there's a free machine,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
it's like

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
when there's only one electron,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
no one holds hands,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
it becomes a mountain.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It destroys

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
your DNA.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It's a good example.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
A free machine is a mountain.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
A mountain will destroy a family.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
A free machine will destroy

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
my body.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's similar to

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
life.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It's far from the past.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
But it's a strong example.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I think many people

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
can understand and catch up.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Yes.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
This way

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
can be trained

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
in daily life.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yesterday,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
when we were in the LINE group,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
we attended

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Tara's speech.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It was a long speech.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I replied right away.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Of course not.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Have you ever seen a steak

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
only served with iron plate

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
and three-color beans

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
without steak?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Iron plate noodles.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yes, iron plate noodles.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
There's no main dish.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
To be a staff member,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
you have to attend an academic speech.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I told her,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
we have a speech.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
There are some metaphors

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
you can apply

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
and learn.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
You can apply it

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
to your writing.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
First,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
visualize

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
something interesting.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Strengthen it.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Then,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
connect your scientific knowledge.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
There are some connections.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
When the reader

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
or audience

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
receives a piece of information,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
they will connect it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It's easy to

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
form a memory.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
How to strengthen the memory

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
is important.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
My teacher was good at this.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
She told me,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
choosing a boss is like choosing a husband.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
You have to be with him for years.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It sounds important.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
She explained to me

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
P-Value.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
We all have a P-Value

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
like a metaphor.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
But how much

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
is the P-Value?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
If you ask her,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
she'll say,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
how much is the P-Value?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
P is 0.9.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It must be terrible.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
If she's good at speaking,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
she'll recommend it.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
If the noodle is good,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
you must try it.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
It must be good.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
It's different.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
It's different from others.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
When she said it, I understood.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
It's not necessarily right.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It's right if you follow her.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
That's a great metaphor.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Everyone said

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
a P-Value at the end.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You know it very well.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You can remember it.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
You can remember it.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Cool.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I want to read your article.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Do you post it on Facebook?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Or blog?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I'll put it on the wall

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and post it

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
on Facebook.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
What's it called?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
V-Side is

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
the fan page of

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Nervous Pig Tail.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
She left a message.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
It's Wen Qing Guan.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yes, it's Wen Qing Guan.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
V-Side is

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
like Tang Feng.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Anyone can be called.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Tang Feng likes us.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Can you share

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
where you

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
share your articles?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Chen Zhen You.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I...

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I share it

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
on Facebook.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I post it

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
on my fan page

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and post it

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
on Nervous Pig Tail

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
V-Side.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Mainly these two.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Can you post your fan page?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Can I?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Sure.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
We're a

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
promotion platform.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
If you want to promote something,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
you can post your link.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Tell us your name.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Let's make a circle.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
My brain has a mouth.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I think I've seen it.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Is it a mouth?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I thought it was a crime.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Is it Wen Qing?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
That's too Wen Qing.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
My brain is a original crime.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I have a like.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Cool.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
When the fans recognize you,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
they'll scream.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I want to ask

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
a similar question.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Chen Zhen You asked

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
how to

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
attract readers

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
in writing.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I want to ask

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
how to

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
attract readers

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
in writing.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I want to share

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
what you want to convey

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
as a scientist.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
This is the problem

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I'm facing.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
When I meet someone

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
or want to flirt,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
you can say

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I'm not good at it.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It's normal.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You can describe

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
you're a physicist

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
or a physicist.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I'm a laser scientist.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I study light.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
They'll say you're so smart.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Their mind

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
will be strong.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Don't tell me

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
your major.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You can feel

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
the wall.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You can't communicate.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I want to know...

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Is your brain like this?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
My wife is interested

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
in my research.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Wait, you have a wife?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I want my wife

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
to be interested.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
His wife is his wife.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I want to know

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
if there's a way

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
to successfully

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
make

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
the other person

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
convey

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
what we learned

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
in science.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Is your goal

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
to talk about science?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Or is your goal...

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
I think

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
this is related

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
to your audience.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You can ask

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
other editors.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I think

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
my goal is

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
to convey

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
what I learned

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
to other people

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
with the money

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I got from

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
the Nazis.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Tell your wife?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
At least my wife

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
should know.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Or people

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I meet.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I want to share

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
something.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
My research

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
focuses on the elderly.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
They have

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
an impression

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
that they're stubborn.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
We have a technique

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
called

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
motivation interviewing.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
You can't

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
directly...

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
If your audience

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
doesn't want to hear you

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
say something,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
don't say it

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
directly.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
CS shared

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
that you have to

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
connect to your topic

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
from their perspective.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
You have to be related

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
to them

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
before they're interested.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Otherwise,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
it's irrelevant

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
to them.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So,

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
it depends on

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
your language,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
your attitude,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
and your usage.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
If you're talking to your wife,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
you can

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
act cute.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You can tell her

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
that you want to share

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
your research

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
with her.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
You're the one

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I want to share

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
with her.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
If you're just a passer-by,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
you can

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
ask her about her background

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
first.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
What's the connection

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
between your research and her background?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
You can discuss it.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Sometimes, you have to

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
be interested in

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
the other person.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
You have to be interested

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
in their background story

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
so that the conversation

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
can go on.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Do other editors

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
have their own

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
techniques or ideas?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yes.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I think it's a good technique.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
You can

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
ask the subject

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
about the field

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
they're interested in

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and see if there's

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
a connection between

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
their science.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
You can let them know

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
what they're interested in.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
From a scientific point of view,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
they can learn

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
about this field.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
For example, my partner

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
likes Hermes a lot.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
She likes the bag.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Do you know the difference

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
between Hermes' alligator

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
and the crocodile?

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
It's not the same.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
The animal patterns

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
on the bag

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
are determined

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
by the genes.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
You can connect

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
the fashion items

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
she likes

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
to the animal genes.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
She'll understand

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
why there's a color

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
or a pattern on the bag.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Or she'll understand

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
the distribution of

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
the animals' origins

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
in different regions.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
You can use it like this.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I think it sounds

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
interesting.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I'll give it a try.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Or you can

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
use a popular

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
catchphrase.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
It's a scientific catchphrase.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Like,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm willing to

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
treat you like a red blood cell.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Your love is my oxygen.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
For your love,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I don't even need my heart.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Red blood cells don't have cells.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It's the opposite.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
You can tell her,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
honey,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
even if we're

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
the same age...

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Honey, I'll treat your love

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
as if we're the same age.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
We'll never be apart.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
We're inseparable.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
She'll ask,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
don't you know?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
These two things

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
are different, but we can't

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
separate them.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's like us.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
It's a scientific fact.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
But you link it

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
to something interesting.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I think a lot of things in science

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
are romantic.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Like receptors.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I can only connect to you.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I can't connect to anyone else.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I want the virus to

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
take the AEC2

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
and connect to us.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
It's painful to be

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
connected to the virus.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
It's like being killed.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
You said we can be separated.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Xiao Jing, you're being spied on.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
What?

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
You're being spied on.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
It's okay.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
We don't need to get married

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
to the virus.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Who was talking just now?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Dou Dou.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Dou Dou is our immune specialist.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
if we talk about immune stuff today,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I'll get infected.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I was going to say

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
you were talking about being poisoned.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
It's not like you'll

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
tell him you're poisoned.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It's just a possibility.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I'll be more aggressive.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
When he's in pain,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I'll say,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
you might not be poisoned,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
but it's a possibility.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Please call an ambulance for me.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I'm not trying to solve his problem.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I'm just being a scientist.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I agree.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
That's a good question.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I don't think I'll

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
really talk to

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
the general public

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
or people who don't

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
study science that much.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Yeah.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I just heard

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Shilan say

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
you're doing research on physics.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
That's really...

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Is that how you say it?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I think

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
it's harder to...

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
That's a weird way to say it.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You're the one who thinks it's weird.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
People think

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
what we do is deep.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
What we do is...

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
It's just a lab.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
It's just

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
putting together

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
capacitors and capacitors.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You're a welder

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and a water pipe connector.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
You connect all kinds of things.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
That's all you do every day.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
It's not as complicated

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
as people think.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I think it's complicated.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I think it's complicated, too.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Yeah.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I think it's because your field

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
sounds complicated.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
You have to start with

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
simple things.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
For example,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
when I talk to people,

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I'm afraid to answer

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
when people ask me about my background.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
When I first came to Italy,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I wanted to make friends,

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
so I talked to people about

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
my background,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and they were like,

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
oh, I see.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
That's usually the case.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
That's usually the case.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
When you're at a friend's party,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
people ask you,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
what do you do?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
You answer, I do physics.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Then people start to change the subject.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
So you have to be prepared.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Like the welder

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
you mentioned earlier.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
He's a good guy.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
It's not that it's difficult

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
when you hear physics,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
but we're like welders.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
We're all welding.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I'll answer,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
it's not that it's difficult,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
but I use my computer to analyze.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I'm just a nerd.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm a nerd.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
This know-how,

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
do you have any questions?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You're welcome.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You can ask all kinds of questions.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Yeah, because podcast

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
is about all kinds of things.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
It's not like we'll answer

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
all the right questions.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
If you listen to our podcast,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
you'll know that every time something comes up,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
we all have different opinions.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
It's a discussion.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Wang Yiting.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I don't know how to pronounce it.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Hi, I'm Yiting.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I'm a part of today's speaker.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I'm happy to be here

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
to teach everyone.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Is it Yiting?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yes, that's me.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Yiting I met at a science activity.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Yes, that's me.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I'm just curious

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
that I've been

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
listening to everyone

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
from the perspective of a spectator

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and thought that

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
everyone's background is more

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
in the field of natural science.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
As far as I know,

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
my field was

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
traditional natural science

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
in medical school.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Then I slowly

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
got closer to social science.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
For example, social science

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
or some other

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
philosophical people

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
might have a chance to collaborate.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Of course, I can't claim

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
that I'm the only one.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
From the perspective of social science,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
they often do

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
so-called knowledge promotion.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
In fact,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
there are a lot of

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
social science-related things on the market.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
For example, legal white paper.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Because everyone feels

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
that when we hear about

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
the problems of natural science,

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
for example,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
everyone is quiet.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
But in fact,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
they also have similar problems.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Oh, I study social science,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and everyone is quiet.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
In fact, I have seen

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
a lot of fans

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
who want to do

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
knowledge promotion

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
of social science.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I want to explain

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
some more complicated concepts to you.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I don't know if you

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
have any experience

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
in this knowledge promotion

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
or so-called science promotion

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
that other partners have discussed.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
In fact, what we want to do is similar,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
but our subjects are different.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I'm just curious about your experience.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
From their perspective,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
how does it work?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Or when you were running

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
a fan page,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
did you see other examples

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
that they did well?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I want to take this opportunity

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
to learn more.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Maybe I haven't revealed it yet,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
but I want to share it with you.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Do you mean

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
social science?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Social science,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
for example,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
psychology.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Psychology is actually quite common,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and I often write articles about it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Maybe economics,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
society, management,

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
law, and politics

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
are all social science.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
In fact,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
they also have some

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
demands

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
that they want to share with the public

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
to let people know that

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
what we do professionally

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
is not just in our own ivory tower,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
but also wants to connect

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
with everyone's daily life.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I think they may also be looking for

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
a place for them to cut in.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
As you said,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I can't think of

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
anything other than

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
legal dialogues.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
But I know

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
there's a lot of

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
cultural knowledge

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
in the show.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
For example,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
linguistics.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I'm actually

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
inviting a linguist

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
to be the host of

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Knowledge is Fun.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I hope he'll accept our interview.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Knowledge is Fun is a podcast

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
about culture and listening.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
They also

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
worked with

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
the New York Times.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It's more natural science.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
They have a series of

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Knowledge is Fun,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
including linguistics,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
criminal psychology,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
and so on.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Philosophy is also fun.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
They also do some sharing.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
What was the name

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
of the show before?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Philosophy, Philosophy, Egg Cake.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
They do

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
a lot of philosophy.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I don't know much

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
about sociology.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
But Lawyer Lv is good.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
He talks a lot

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
about everything.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Do you have

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
any comments

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
or thoughts

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
you'd like to share?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I like the story.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I think it's

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
about history.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Yes.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It's so good.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
You can see it on iQIYI.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I'm still watching

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
on Instagram.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Unless I'm really interested,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I'll look at the text.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But I think they're good.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
They write about history.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It's a story.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It's interesting.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
When I was in high school,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I don't know if you've seen

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
what history textbooks

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I wrote in high school.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Why did I write

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
literary textbooks in high school?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
And all of my answers

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
were wrong.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You're revealing your age.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I'm revealing my age.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
The most painful thing

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
was that I thought literary textbooks

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
had a lot of room to explain.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
It's just two or three words.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I thought maybe that's what they meant.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I was like, why would you think that?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Of course, I didn't have time

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
to discuss this with you in class.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
But I think that's the way

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
you should learn history.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
History is what people do.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
A person may have a lot of reasons

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
to do this.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Why must it be like this?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Today, he wrote a non-human disaster.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Was he happy to write a non-human disaster?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Did he write a non-human disaster?

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Or did he think he looked ugly?

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Or did he think

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
it was too much to

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
deal with?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You don't know.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Why do you only have one answer?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Do you have any

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
suggestions?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Are you doing

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
research on this?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Do you have any suggestions

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
for us?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Because I also

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
had more opportunities to

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
get in touch with philosophy on Friday.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I used to have

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
very unfamiliar discussions.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
When I started participating,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I thought that

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
if the mainstream background

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
was more

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
natural science,

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
people would have a way of discussing

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and speaking.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
But in the mainstream of

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
social science,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
they would also have a way of speaking.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
When I first participated,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I thought it was a new experience.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
But after a few times,

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I realized that

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
many things are the same.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It's just that

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
how do we make

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
what we think is important

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
but may be complicated

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
more interesting to more people?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I don't have many

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
suggestions.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I just think that

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
the experience of

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
exposing each other

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
is helpful to me.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I may see more opportunities

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
to get closer to each other.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
So I'm just curious

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
if this is a future direction

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
of Sky in the World.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
As you just heard,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
we are now in the industry

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
where people call each other

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
the wall side.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Through this way of

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
increasing contact,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I think it can really help us

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
to understand more.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
In addition to wanting to

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
let others understand our knowledge,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I think the experience

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
of teaching each other

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
is quite useful to me.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So I'm just curious

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
if this is also a future direction

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
that everyone is interested in.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
It sounds like there is.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I just want to share this.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
This is not the future,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
this is the progress.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
In our interview,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
we will invite people from

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
different fields.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Of course,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
we will invite people

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
from different fields.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
For example,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
we have interviewed

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
people from education,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
such as Annie,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
who was our guest speaker

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
last time,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and Dr. Yi Yang,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
who is a professor of music.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
He is teaching music history

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
in the US.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
We will also invite people

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
from language studies,

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
or even people

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
who are not in the scientific field.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
We have also interviewed

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
people like Maria,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
who is a Chinese bride.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
We have always been

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
trying to get in touch

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
with people from different fields.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
But this is not

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
a scientific conversation.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Our research field

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
is very different,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
but we all have to live.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
So I will put this

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
topic in the interview,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
because the interview

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
may be a topic

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
on how to plan

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
your life.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
So when different

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
life plans

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
are shared by people

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
from different fields,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
there will be different sparks.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Because we all have to live,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
but we don't have to be

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
scientific.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
So we use this sense of community

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
in our interviews.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I hope I have answered your question.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
You mentioned that

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
if you want to join

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
the self-media

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
or spread the message,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
the threshold is very low.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
For example,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
if we want to do a podcast,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
we only need a computer

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
and a cell phone.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
So we don't need

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
any equipment

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
The only difficulty

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
is the adjustment

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
in time.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
That's because our team is big.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Sorry, our team is a bit big.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
We need to adjust.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
But if

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
we are a single person,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
we have heard

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
that the podcast is a single person.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
So if you are a person

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
and I want to share something with everyone,

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
you can.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
I just thought that

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
if you are a college student

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
in the architecture department,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
they also have their own podcast.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I forgot the name.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
If you want to know,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
you can find out.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I just want to say

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
hi to everyone.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
You can communicate with Alan.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
We are good friends.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
We have a LINE group.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
We talk every day.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
We talk a lot every day.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
I think

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
this is a very good direction.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Because we really

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
lack

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
certain types of scholars.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
We lack a lot.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
The physicist, please

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
agree to our interview.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Otherwise, we won't let you off the hook.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
This is his.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Sorry.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You should

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
invite him to

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
an interview.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Let's help him discuss

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
how to chat with his wife.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
After the interview,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
we will let his wife listen to it.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
It's very interesting.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It's very interesting.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But our audience

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
has a question.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Let's let the audience ask first.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I want to ask

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
have you ever thought

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
to promote your podcast

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
to high school or even high school?

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Because you have a lot of skills.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Like protein

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
or bacteria.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Those skills

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
made me think

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
this is my high school knowledge.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
If the school taught like this at that time,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
it might

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
be more interesting.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
I think

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
this channel is really interesting.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
If I have a chance to promote

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
to national high school,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
it might be very interesting.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Thank you.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
That's a very good suggestion.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
But we can't

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
control the audience's level.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
But

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I have tried my best

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
to find teachers

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
to interview.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I hope to attract

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
their approval.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Maybe it can be spread.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
But

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
teaching at national high school

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
really needs to teach

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
the principles

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
or rules.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Because

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
we talk about

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
academic articles in the program.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
So it might be

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
something that hasn't been decided yet.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
It's possible.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
So

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I don't know

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
if I can understand

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
this program

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
without a solid basic knowledge.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
I'm afraid that

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
they will fight with the teacher

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
after the Sky in the World interview.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Isn't it good?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Our education needs this kind of spark.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I think this is to convey to them

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
that something is not only the right answer.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Aren't these people doctors?

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I think high school should

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
have a chance.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Because

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
the basic knowledge

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
like sugar,

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
or protein,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
or fat,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I think they should

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
have a chance

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
to interact with the textbook.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I hope

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
high school students can come.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Our

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Clubhouse

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
has a

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
host

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
twice in a row.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's a textbook on Instagram.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
It's three times in a row.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
So

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
we hope to

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
get to know these people.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
OK.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Thank you.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
It's my first time to see you.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It's my first time to see you.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
It's my first time to see you.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It's my first time to see you.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
You look like

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
a grandpa.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
My white beard.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
My white beard.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Do I look like a grandpa?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Do I look like a grandpa?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Yes, your glasses.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
You look like a natural

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
grandpa.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Mom's dad.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Adam, do you want to take off your shirt?

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Or he can't recognize you.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I can recognize you.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
On Instagram,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I saw Adam

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
showing off his muscles.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
It's different from now.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
It's different from now.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Too many people. I'm not shy.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
OK.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Sorry to interrupt.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I want to

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
comment from Taira's perspective.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
You mentioned

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
many platforms.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I don't know

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
about them.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I've never seen or heard of them.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I want to say

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
from Taira's perspective,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
we might want to

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
collaborate with these organizations.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
We can try.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I don't know

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
if we should

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
organize

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
a group

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
to talk about

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
science or

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
knowledge.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
We can

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
write down

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
the links

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
and see

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
who we can collaborate with.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
The second comment

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
is

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
from Taira's perspective.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
We have many PhD students.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
They have

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
very professional

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
background knowledge.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I think

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
we should

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
collaborate with them.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
We can find people

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
to interview.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I think

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
you can see

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
that Taira's team

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
focuses on natural science.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
But there are

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
many branches in natural science.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
there are many

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
areas I've never heard of

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
before.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
So I think

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
you can dig

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
and protect them.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
You can dig for resources.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
I just want to say that.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
How can we find

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Taira's

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
contacts?

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Are you the window?

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I want to find

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Taira's contacts.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Taira has a PR team.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
I think our seminar team is too busy.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
We have a PR team.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Xinda has a PR team.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
You are familiar with it.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Yes.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I used to be in the PR team.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Then I

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
became

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
the president.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
That's it.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
You can

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
contact us.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Maybe we can

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
work together.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I think it's interesting.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I have an idea.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I just thought of it.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I don't have to agree with you.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Sleep on it.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Taiwan

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
has interviewed

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Shanae.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
She is the PI

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
for Taiwan.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
They are

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
doing the same thing

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
as us.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
They are also working on

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
scientific communication.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
They are from the UK.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
They are distributed in 5 or 6 different countries.
