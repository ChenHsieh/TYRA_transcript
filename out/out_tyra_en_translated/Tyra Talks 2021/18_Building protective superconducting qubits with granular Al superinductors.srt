00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Welcome to today's TARTalk. We are honored to have Dr. Ronson to talk about his research on quantum bit during his Ph.D. class.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Before we start, let me introduce today's speaker.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Dr. Ronson graduated from Rochester University in the east of the United States this year.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
His work in his Ph.D. class is mainly to use superconducting man-made atoms to achieve protective superconducting qubits.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Before his Ph.D. class, he worked in the 3D IC department of TSMC for two and a half years.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He just finished his Ph.D. class and got his degree.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He will move to IBM Research as a Research Scientist and continue to develop and integrate his most specialized superconducting quantum chips.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At the same time, he is also one of the members of the Qiskit Advocate of the IBM Q promotion plan.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In addition to his main superconducting qubit research, he is also very committed to developing quantum education and games with Qiskit.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's welcome Dr. Ronson to give us today's speech with a warm applause.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dr. Ronson, thank you for giving me this opportunity to share with you.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can see my laser pointer.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What I'm going to share with you today is my work at the Ph.D. class.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There are three parts of my work at the Ph.D. class.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The first part is Low-EJ's Josephson-Johnson superconductor.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The third part is the prototype of a quantum circuit.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We call it bifloxone qubit.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because junction is a little boring, and there are some time constraints, I won't mention junction.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The main focus is on the bifloxone circuit and a more important component in it, the superconductor.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dr. Ronson is here again.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This circuit is very similar to the bifloxone circuit.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's just that the black-shift junction is changed to a cooper-pair box, and the gate is used to connect.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because I do Fab, not design, I will try to explain the circuit.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But there may be some Hamiltonian behind the theory.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because of time constraints, I won't mention too much.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not a specialist in quantum circuits.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can discuss any questions you have.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Because not everyone here is doing qubit, I will briefly mention it.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In quantum computation technology, especially in qubit hardware, there are mainly five criteria.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
These are the five criteria proposed by Dr. Ronson in 2000.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The first two are circuit depth, which is how long a circuit can run before the signal disappears.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So you can put a few gates before the signal disappears.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The other criteria is the number of qubits.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Dr. Ronson's work is more like de-extending the circuit depth of super-canon qubit.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That is to say, try to increase our either coherent time or dephasing time.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Here is a recent meme, a web meme.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It summarizes the paper of super-canon qubit.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now we can see that there are 12 kinds of papers.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dr. Ronson's work is basically located in these three papers.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He wrote that Johnson and Johnson can do so many things.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is my first work.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The second is to realize super-inductors, impossible inductors.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The third one is our prototype.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We made a new qubit and it is awful.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just kidding.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is my work at Dr. Ronson's lab.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The first one is super-inductors.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We try to realize super-inductors with granular aluminum.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The second one is super-inductors based on Johnson to realize bifluxon qubits.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The third one is super-inductors based on granular aluminum to realize bifluxon qubits.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is an ongoing project.

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Maybe we can talk about it later.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But today's main focus is these two.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Basically, this page is a brief introduction of Johnson.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Johnson is basically a capacitor.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Its two sides are super-conductors.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There is a thin layer of aluminum oxide in the middle.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In our device, we use aluminum-based.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We use a shadow mask to grow an aluminum layer in one direction.

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then introduce some oxygen into the vacuum chamber.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then another layer of aluminum is cut in the other direction.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is Johnson.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Johnson can be represented by three elements on the model.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
One of them will affect the resistance of the circuit damping.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There is also a capacitor and a non-linear inductor.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The characteristic energy of the capacitor and the inductor is

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Q2 over 2C

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is the energy generated by the Johnson effect.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Johnson effect basically describes

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can use the phase difference of the super-current on both sides of Johnson as a parameter.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
To parameterize the characteristics of the circuit element IV.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Its current and voltage can be parameterized by phase.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Then you can get its characteristic energy.

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In practice, what Johnson I did today

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How much is the resistance of the two sides of the circuit?

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It is inversely proportional to Ej.

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ej and Ec can be used in classical physics.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can think of it as the kinetic energy and potential energy in classical physics.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ej is like a potential energy in phase representation.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ec is like kinetic energy.

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When the quantity of Ej and Ec is in the correct position

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When Ej and Ec are comparable

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because of the quantum confinement effect

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We can observe the generation of energy levels.

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In quantum computation, we take the first and zeroth connection to do the operation.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
For example, if the energy level is non-equally spaced today

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can use the microwave to address the ground state and the first excited state more accurately.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is the basic concept of quantum computation using superconducting artificial atoms.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just mentioned that Ej can be compared to kinetic energy and potential energy.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In classical physics, we know that kinetic energy and potential energy

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Because of the mathematical structure of kinetic energy and potential energy

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We can expect them to represent their own bases.

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
For example, the kinetic energy base is the kinetic energy, and the unknown base is the unknown.

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Therefore, P and delta P and delta X will follow the computational relation.

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can expect them to have certain principles.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There is a similar phenomenon in superconducting circuits.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We use the basis of charging energy, which is the number of cooper pairs.

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And the basis of Josephine energy, which is the parameterized supercurrent phase.

101
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
These two operators will also follow the so-called oscillating principle.

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In superconducting circuits, we are more concerned about charging energy.

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If we want to minimize the charge noise, we need to maximize the phase fluctuation.

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:28,000
To maximize the phase fluctuation, we need to compress the energy spectrum into a parabola.

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Therefore, we need a large inductance to flatten the parabola.

106
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In this way, we can get a relatively low charge sensitivity.

107
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is why we want to make a superconductor.

108
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Traditionally, in semiconductor, the way to make a superconductor is to make a line.

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The thinner the line, the larger the inductance.

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Last year, there was a paper to demonstrate how large the inductance can be.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This paper realized about 1 uH and 30 kΩ.

112
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The reason why kΩ impedance is an important parameter is that

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we want a superconductor to operate at a certain frequency.

114
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We want the superconductor to maintain an inductive response.

115
00:11:42,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That is to say, the operating frequency must be higher than the operating frequency.

116
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This resonant frequency can be used to equal 1 over square of LC.

117
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That is to say, if you have a large L and the corresponding F is fixed,

118
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
your specific capacitance must be small enough.

119
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This will correspond to a high enough impedance.

120
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The reason why impedance is an important parameter is because of this.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This paper demonstrates that it is already a limit.

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because the black part of the device is hollowed out.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
However, it is quite difficult to do this.

124
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
To make a device of hundreds of microns in size and hollow out the substrate,

125
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
leaving only a very thin dielectric, is very challenging.

126
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Generally, we use superconducting kinetic inductance to do this.

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Here is an example of what we do in our lab.

128
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We use a material called granular aluminum.

129
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We will see a simple structure of it later.

130
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This material is provided by Cooper-Pear kinetic inductance.

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
On the other hand, we use Johnson-Johnson inductance.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I forgot the name of the professor.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This is Professor Lin's lab.

134
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is made by Maruchan and his group.

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is the largest inductance in the world.

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It is 2.5 microhenry with an impedance of up to 200 kΩ.

137
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The way they do this is to remove the entire Johnson-Johnson substrate.

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It is similar to the concept of suspended graphene.

139
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
After removing the oxide at the bottom,

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and over-etching, the metal will rise up due to the force.

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
By doing this, you can remove the substrate and get a very high impedance.

142
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is provided by Johnson-Johnson superconductor.

143
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is a simple description of why we need a superconductor.

144
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
These are some of the challenges we face in superkinetic qubit.

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Whichever is smaller, either T1 or T2,

146
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the shortest decoherence is not equal to Tg.

147
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The number of times a circuit can operate is the so-called circuit depth.

148
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What we need to do is to try to extend the circuit depth.

149
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The next thing I want to talk about is how to extend the circuit depth.

150
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
One way is to use parity protection.

151
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The concept of parity protection is...

152
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sorry, let me first talk about what T1 and T2 are,

153
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and what we are focusing on in this talk.

154
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
T1 and T2 are a number in the NMR system.

155
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:54,000
T1 refers to how long it takes for a qubit or electron to be excited to the first excited state,

156
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and how long it takes for it to relax back.

157
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If this is a block sphere in a qubit,

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the physical picture is that when you excite from 0 to 1,

159
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
after a certain amount of time, the ball will slowly shrink back to 0.

160
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Defacing is more like how to decoherence the information on the face of the xy plane.

161
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We are mainly talking about the relaxation of T1,

162
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
which is to say, how to suppress from 1 to 0 before 0 to 1.

163
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I have made a brief video on how to realize 0 and 1 in superconducting qubits.

164
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is a device for charge qubits.

165
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It can be written as 4EC times the number of qubit pairs,

166
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
which is the number of qubit pairs on the island.

167
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In this structure, we can see that when n is equal to 0,

168
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
it means that there is 0 charge on the island,

169
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and when n is equal to 1, it means that there is 1 charge on the island.

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There will be individual parabola corresponding to this.

171
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
For example, if you are 0 today, your energy should look like this.

172
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When there is 1 charge on the island, it looks like this.

173
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
In fact, the energy is the number of qubit pairs you add up,

174
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and the whole charge is your charging energy.

175
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If there is a charge running on the island today,

176
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
we expect that your energy will jump from here to here.

177
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
For example, you have some quasi-particle tunneling.

178
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
On the other hand, you will have some local charge noise.

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you have some local noise today,

180
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
your energy will jump from here to here.

181
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
At this time, if I turn on Jordan-Johnson tunneling today,

182
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I just saw that Jordan-Johnson is a capacitor.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The energy diagram we expect looks like this.

184
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If I turn on Jordan-Johnson effect today,

185
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
what we see is that we will have so-called anti-level crossing,

186
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and then you will have 0 state and 1 state.

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In this case, it is a similar situation in our system,

188
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
but we only use flux as the basis.

189
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What we are actually observing is the so-called flux zone.

190
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The concept of flux zone is the circulation in the circuit today,

191
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
which is your super-current phase winding.

192
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
For example, if you have a flux zone tunnel today,

193
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
your super-current will have an extra graph,

194
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and your phase will have an extra graph wrapping.

195
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The concept of flux zone is used to...

196
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
As I mentioned earlier,

197
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the concept of protection today is...

198
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's say we have a system today,

199
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
which is completely invisible to each other between 0 and 1.

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In other words,

201
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have a...

202
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's put it this way.

203
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Basically, if we play today...

204
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Because of this Jordan-Johnson tunneling,

205
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
what will happen is that it allows you to jump from 0 to 1,

206
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but you can also jump from 1 to 0 because of the coupling with the outside world.

207
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But if we have a switch today,

208
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we can put the system between 0 and 1.

209
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Because in this case,

210
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
let's say we have a degeneracy.

211
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Basically, when I open 0 and 1 today,

212
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that is, when the switching system is in a different situation,

213
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I can do...

214
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
When I want to read and write the system today,

215
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can do 0 and 1 writing.

216
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
When I want to read today,

217
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can let the system enter the so-called protective state.

218
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
At this time,

219
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the signal will be preserved.

220
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It can be preserved better.

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I may not have done a good job.

222
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I tried to use the concept of degeneracy to explain,

223
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
but the effect may not be very good.

224
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But basically,

225
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
if we write it down...

226
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Vincent, sorry.

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Vincent, sorry.

228
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Can I ask a question?

229
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes, you can.

230
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hello.

231
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can I go back to the last page?

232
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes.

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I want to ask you...

234
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This seems to be a very basic thing.

235
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So when you do the rotational...

236
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because the part below you,

237
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
minus one-half EJ,

238
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
is your transition,

239
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
right?

240
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Then the above is basically

241
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the amount of charge

242
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
on your island.

243
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If...

244
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We discussed it last time.

245
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
When you do it,

246
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you should also see some charge drop.

247
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It should be on the top.

248
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It affects NG here.

249
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So when you do rotation with approximation,

250
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it should eliminate the above.

251
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But if it's charge drop,

252
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the frequency it affects

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
will probably affect

254
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
the order of magnitude.

255
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
My understanding is...

256
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm not doing charge qubit.

257
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But my understanding is

258
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
it's effective the same.

259
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It won't affect.

260
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why?

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So the above...

262
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
4EC N-NG square.

263
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This basically turns it into frequency.

264
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So you want to do

265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
rotation with approximation?

266
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes.

267
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
OK.

268
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But...

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
OK.

270
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But there's a shift.

271
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It affects the picture.

272
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think it's probably calibrated.

273
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
OK.

274
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So let's say...

275
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You usually put

276
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
1,000 electrons.

277
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Then you jump an electron.

278
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Your frequency jump

279
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
is about one-third of the jump.

280
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
How much is that?

281
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Two-thirds?

282
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Because it's N square.

283
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So I don't know...

284
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I should say...

285
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think I should say...

286
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't know...

287
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's under rotation with approximation.

288
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
In fact,

289
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I don't know how to do calibration.

290
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So I can't comment.

291
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Sorry.

292
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yes.

293
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But my understanding is

294
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it's...

295
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
In fact, charge jump

296
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
happens for a long time.

297
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So we actually

298
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
don't really...

299
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If you really meet it,

300
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
you're not very lucky.

301
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But we usually

302
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
take it as

303
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the main calibration.

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So we don't worry about it.

305
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's just that it takes a long time.

306
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
For example,

307
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
10 milliseconds,

308
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you'll see it once.

309
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
10 milliseconds, you'll see it once.

310
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But if you see it,

311
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
because we basically do single shot,

312
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so we don't really worry about it.

313
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So I'm not very convinced.

314
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Got it.

315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
OK.

316
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It doesn't matter.

317
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Keep going.

318
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Thank you.

319
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
OK.

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Sorry.

321
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Then I'll...

322
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll talk about it more smoothly

323
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
this week.

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because this week...

325
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Basically, we...

326
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Our basic concept is

327
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
we're in Flux on Parity.

328
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm going to build a mechanism

329
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
in my circuit

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
to turn on and turn off

331
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
my protection.

332
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Suppose I...

333
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The concept of on and off protection

334
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
comes from what I just said.

335
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Suppose it's a degeneracy lifting.

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That is to say,

337
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
suppose my system has degeneracy.

338
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Then I can somehow prevent

339
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
the degenerated ground state

340
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
between the two.

341
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
They can communicate

342
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
between the two.

343
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Suppose I have this ability.

344
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Then I can do one thing.

345
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That is, I can

346
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
preserve the data

347
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
in the protected state.

348
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In the unprotected state.

349
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That is, I can disable this protection.

350
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then it has degeneracy lifting.

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Then we can do

352
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
0 and 1 read and write.

353
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then this is a...

354
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
a...

355
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
a concept.

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Then our work this time is

357
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
a proof of concept.

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then we actually use

359
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the mechanism I just said.

360
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's the so-called Aruna-Kesher effect.

361
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Aruna-Kesher effect is basically

362
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Aruna-Bohm effect

363
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
which is a dual version of Aruna-Bohm.

364
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Imagine that

365
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Aruna-Bohm is

366
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
an electron in the gas.

367
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Then there are some

368
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
non-zero vector potentials in it.

369
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
When the electron propagates,

370
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
it will have

371
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
destructive or

372
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
constructive interference

373
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
because of this vector potential.

374
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Then Aruna-Kesher effect

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
refers to a fluxon.

376
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
When it is tunneling,

377
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
there is a junction on the left or right

378
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
to do tunneling.

379
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In the process of tunneling,

380
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
how many charges

381
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
exist on this island

382
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
will have some impact.

383
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
In the case of

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
a single electron,

385
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
this tunneling will have

386
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
destructive interference

387
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
which suppresses the

388
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
tunneling of a single fluxon.

389
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The specific performance

390
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
in Hamiltonian

391
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
is that

392
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
there are two

393
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
degenerate ground states

394
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
in the optimized point.

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
However,

396
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
these two states

397
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
cannot see each other.

398
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is why

399
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
we call it

400
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
parity protection.

401
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So,

402
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
do you have any

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
questions

404
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
or

405
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
need to explain more clearly?

406
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If not,

407
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
let's move on to the first part.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The superconductor.

409
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The superconductor of quantum mechanics.

410
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OK.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I will continue to explain.

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I just mentioned

413
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
how to

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
realize the circuit.

415
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
A very important element

416
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
is to

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
make the

418
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
superconductor.

419
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
The superconductor

420
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
is made of

421
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
granular aluminum.

422
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Its microscopic structure

423
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
is like this.

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The red one is aluminum,

425
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and the green one is aluminum oxide.

426
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The way to

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
grow it is

428
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
to add some oxygen

429
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to the argon plasma

430
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
during the sputter process.

431
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Then,

432
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
pressurize

433
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
about 1%

434
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to 1%

435
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
of the concentration.

436
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Then,

437
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we can get a structure like this.

438
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The grain size is usually

439
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
about 3 to 4 nanometers.

440
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
This graph shows

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
the experimental data

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
extracted from

443
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
the literature.

444
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This graph shows

445
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the TCE and resistivity.

446
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We can see that

447
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
as the resistivity increases,

448
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
the TCE

449
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
starts to grow.

450
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The pure aluminum

451
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
is about 1.3K.

452
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Then, it will grow to 2K.

453
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
In different degrees,

454
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
we can get different films.

455
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The grain size is different.

456
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The maximum TCE

457
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
can reach 3K.

458
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
However, when we continue

459
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
to increase the resistivity,

460
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
the TCE will not grow.

461
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It will not have

462
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the so-called

463
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
disorderly induced

464
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
SI transition.

465
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Why do we need to increase

466
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
the resistivity?

467
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The reason is that

468
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
kinetic inductance

469
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
can increase

470
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
the resistance.

471
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This is the

472
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
experimental demo

473
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
of a sub-inductor.

474
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We basically made it

475
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
into a resonator structure

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to measure its

477
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
resonant frequency.

478
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Then, we can get

479
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
its inductance.

480
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
We got an impedance

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
of about 30kΩ

482
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and an inductor

483
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
of 1.3uH.

484
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Here are some details

485
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
about the application.

486
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This is the resistivity

487
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
as a function of oxygen flow.

488
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We later found that

489
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
the more accurate method

490
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
is to use a flow meter

491
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
instead of oxygen pressure.

492
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
If you are interested in

493
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the details,

494
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
we can talk about it

495
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in more detail later.

496
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The resistivity we made

497
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
can be controlled

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
by a flow meter.

499
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We just mentioned

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
that we made it

501
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
into a resonator structure.

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The black part is

503
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the granular aluminum.

504
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The white part is the pure aluminum.

505
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We made it

506
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
into a resonator

507
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
of half-wavelength

508
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
called planar waveguide geometry.

509
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Then, we threw it into the fridge

510
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to measure its

511
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
resonant frequency.

512
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We extracted

513
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
the quality factor.

514
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We further

515
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
characterized the quality factor

516
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
as a function of temperature.

517
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We got

518
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
a feature

519
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
of the quality factor

520
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
which is

521
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
a line

522
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
that does not change

523
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
with temperature

524
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
when it is

525
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
below 250kΩ.

526
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We observed

527
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that it is

528
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
an exponentially

529
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
decaying

530
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
quality factor.

531
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It is

532
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
similar to

533
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the superconductor

534
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in many disorders.

535
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We observed

536
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
a two-level system behavior

537
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
at low temperature.

538
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
At high temperature,

539
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
we observed

540
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
a semi-regenerated

541
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
quasi-particle.

542
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What is the difference between

543
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
these two things?

544
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
At low temperature,

545
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
it is a two-level system.

546
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
A two-level system

547
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
usually has

548
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
some non-saturated

549
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
or non-reactive

550
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
oxides or dielectrics

551
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in the dielectric

552
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
when the film

553
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is growing.

554
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
These dielectrics

555
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
will produce

556
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
some local

557
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
electrical dipoles.

558
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
They will have

559
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
some oscillation

560
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
with the

561
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
EM field

562
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
in our

563
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
micro-resonator.

564
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This will

565
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
cause an additional

566
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
loss.

567
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This loss

568
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
will not change

569
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
with the temperature.

570
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
At higher temperature,

571
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
a quasi-particle

572
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
will be produced.

573
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It is similar to

574
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
when you get closer to Tc,

575
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
your couple pair

576
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
will start to break

577
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
due to temperature.

578
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
These normal electrons

579
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
will reduce

580
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
your quality factor.

581
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
These normal electrons

582
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
will produce

583
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
some excitation

584
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
from exponential

585
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
1 over kT

586
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
to produce a model.

587
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
This is the so-called

588
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Martin-Spartan theory.

589
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So basically,

590
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
our work here is to verify...

591
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I have a question.

592
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you have exactly

593
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
the same geometry

594
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
as ordinary aluminum?

595
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We are curious

596
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
about the difference between

597
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
granular aluminum

598
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and ordinary aluminum.

599
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We didn't really

600
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
calibrate the two-level system.

601
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Pure aluminum

602
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
has a

603
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
very low

604
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
kinetic doctrine,

605
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
so

606
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
we didn't really

607
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
calibrate

608
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
the two-level system.

609
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, okay.

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I understand.

611
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I think

612
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
another

613
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
crude comparison

614
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is that if you

615
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
make exactly the same feature

616
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
but ordinary aluminum,

617
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
what is the difference

618
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
between your QI?

619
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If your QI is

620
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
TLS lost at low temperature,

621
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you can compare, right?

622
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think

623
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
the two-level system

624
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I just mentioned

625
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
is highly related to your QI.

626
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
For example, if we make

627
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
granular aluminum,

628
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I also suspect that our aluminum...

629
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Because granular aluminum

630
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
is built-in oxide.

631
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So will the material itself

632
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
have some two-level system loss

633
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
from the structure of the material itself?

634
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
This is also possible.

635
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yes, I'm actually

636
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
worried about this.

637
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Okay, I understand.

638
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay, so...

639
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The details

640
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
need to be more

641
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
detailed.

642
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It does require more detailed

643
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
analysis of the structure.

644
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Because the two-level system is

645
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
the source of

646
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
the NOES of OneOF.

647
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So

648
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
we need to spend more time on it.

649
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
For example, for surface cleaning,

650
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
we need to be more careful

651
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and more detailed.

652
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Right.

653
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay, thank you.

654
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Thank you.

655
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And...

656
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Right, so basically

657
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
what I'm talking about here is

658
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
we are fitting two parameters,

659
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
which are the parameters in practice,

660
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
the results obtained in practice,

661
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
which are my frequency shift and my quality factor.

662
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Then I can get

663
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
a very good match,

664
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that is, the contribution of my loss

665
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
is basically

666
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
temperature-independent.

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
At low temperature,

668
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
it is temperature-independent

669
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
two-level system loss

670
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that dominates.

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
At high temperature,

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
more than 250 mC,

673
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I can see the sum of

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the sum of the generated

675
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
quasiparticle that dominates.

676
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes, this is a simple summary.

677
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

678
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Next is our

679
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
performance QP.

680
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
This time we use

681
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Junction to do super-inductor.

682
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It is closer to

683
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
what Meru and Quarren did.

684
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Then,

685
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
as we just mentioned,

686
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
using quantum mechanics to do super-inductor

687
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
to build this structure

688
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
is still an ongoing process.

689
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In this circuit,

690
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
how can this circuit

691
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
be mapped to this place?

692
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Basically, you turn this 90 degrees,

693
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
then these two junctions,

694
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
these two red cross,

695
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
then this super-inductor,

696
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
half here,

697
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the other half here,

698
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
then the last two sides

699
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
are connected to this.

700
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This thing turns 90 degrees counterclockwise,

701
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
then it will be mapped to this graph.

702
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then connect to a radar resonator.

703
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This radar resonator is coupled

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
to a microwave line.

705
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is a strip-line structure,

706
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
not a coplanar waveguide.

707
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
These are basically

708
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
how we do this device.

709
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Then,

710
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the device parameters,

711
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
what we do on the structure

712
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is that we

713
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
use

714
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
our super-inductor,

715
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
we can't do much in this device.

716
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Basically,

717
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I remember

718
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
this device is

719
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
less than a microherry.

720
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This device

721
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is less than

722
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
a microherry.

723
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's not an ideal device.

724
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
When our super-inductor

725
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is not big enough,

726
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
we still have

727
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
T1 protection,

728
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but our defacient protection

729
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is not too big.

730
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Basically,

731
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
our T2 data

732
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
is about

733
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
1 microsecond.

734
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
T1 can be

735
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
10 to 100 microseconds.

736
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Our device

737
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
is

738
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
basically

739
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
a charge-sensitive device

740
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
because it has a coplanar island.

741
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Then,

742
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
in this device,

743
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
we do

744
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
quasi-particle trap.

745
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The concept is basically

746
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
because we have

747
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
an island structure,

748
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
we have three different

749
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
films,

750
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
three layers of aluminum.

751
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They are all aluminum,

752
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but they are made in different processes.

753
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
These three layers

754
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
can be separated.

755
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
These two are the same layer,

756
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and this is the other layer.

757
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
We can adjust the thickness

758
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
to make the aluminum in the middle

759
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
thinner.

760
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The aluminum will have a bigger

761
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Tc, a bigger bandgap.

762
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This kind of structure

763
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
can make

764
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the middle

765
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
island

766
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
have a bigger bandgap.

767
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So, the quasi-particle

768
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
is not easy to come up,

769
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and suppress

770
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the quasi-particle poisoning.

771
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It is simply controlled

772
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
by the thickness of the film.

773
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Then,

774
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
we observed that

775
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
in 8 hours,

776
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
we only saw a few times

777
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
the quasi-particle

778
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
jump.

779
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The number of times is relatively small,

780
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and each measurement

781
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ends very quickly.

782
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If it is a time domain,

783
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
it ends very quickly,

784
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so we rarely

785
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
encounter it.

786
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Basically, we measure the data

787
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and

788
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
this is a relatively impressive

789
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
place.

790
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If you don't do

791
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
quasi-particle trap,

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the frequency of the jump

793
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is about 10 ms.

794
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
In our system,

795
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the shortest

796
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
is also about

797
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
10 ms.

798
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
This

799
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
is our

800
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
frequency domain

801
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
of spectroscopy.

802
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
These are

803
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
X01 transition,

804
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
which is

805
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
the cubic spectrum.

806
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The blue data

807
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
is the

808
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
unprotected state,

809
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
which is the

810
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
anti-level crossing.

811
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The orange data

812
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
is the

813
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
island bias 1E,

814
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
which is 0.5.

815
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
We see

816
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
degeneracy,

817
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
which is the Arunacheshire effect.

818
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
When we enable

819
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the system's protected state,

820
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
we see

821
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
degenerated ground state.

822
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
When

823
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
we enter

824
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
0E,

825
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
we enter the unprotected state,

826
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and we can do the reading.

827
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
On the other hand,

828
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
the linear fit

829
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
is basically

830
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
the super-inductor.

831
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We can get

832
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the super-inductor

833
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
inductance.

834
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Sorry, the inductance is

835
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
0.1 mH,

836
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
not 1 mH.

837
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
On the other hand,

838
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
we observe

839
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the

840
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
self-resonance

841
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
frequency, which is

842
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
0.1 mH.

843
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
From this frequency,

844
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
we can get the junction-based super-inductor.

845
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Its impedance is

846
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
about 4 kΩ.

847
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The proof-of-concept

848
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
shown here

849
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is how to

850
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
enable

851
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
the protected state

852
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and

853
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
compare

854
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the protected and unprotected state.

855
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This is the

856
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
microwave protocol.

857
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The y-axis

858
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
is the charge,

859
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
which means

860
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I turn on

861
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the protection

862
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
on i.e. bias 1E,

863
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and turn off the protection

864
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
on i.e. remove the gate.

865
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What we do

866
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is to let the system

867
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
be in unprotected state,

868
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and then we

869
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
write the system into 1.

870
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Then we turn on the protection.

871
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
This is a 30-minute

872
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
pause to

873
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
turn on the protection.

874
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The duration is Δt.

875
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
After Δt,

876
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I turn off the pause

877
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and read the system

878
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
to see whether it is in 0 or 1.

879
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
This is the relaxation of the system.

880
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The delta is here.

881
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
If there is no

882
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
gate,

883
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the T1 feed

884
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is about 12 microseconds.

885
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
When I turn on

886
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
the protection,

887
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
the T1 can reach

888
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
100 microseconds,

889
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
which is 10 times

890
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the improvement.

891
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
However,

892
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
the T1 of this device

893
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
is still quite bad,

894
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
which is only 10 microseconds.

895
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We can use

896
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ArrayCatcherEffect

897
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to demonstrate

898
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that ArrayCatcherEffect

899
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
can help us achieve

900
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
a protected effect.

901
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Basically,

902
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
we verify

903
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
this graph

904
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
at different flux-biasing points.

905
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We can see

906
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
about 10 times

907
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the improvement.

908
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The location of 0.3

909
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is PhiExternal

910
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and 6 PiExternal

911
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
are matched to

912
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the read-out resonator.

913
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Therefore, we get

914
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
0.3

915
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
or 6 GHz.

916
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
These 6 GHz

917
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
are the

918
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
read-out resonator

919
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
frequencies.

920
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
This is the

921
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
conclusion.

922
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
We realize

923
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
a prototype circuit.

924
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
This circuit

925
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
can have

926
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
a protective

927
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
mechanism.

928
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We can

929
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
enjoy

930
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
a short gate-time

931
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
while

932
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
enjoying a higher

933
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
improvement of T1.

934
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This is

935
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
the main topic of today.

936
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Thank you to all my collaborators.

937
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Thank you for your

938
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
participation.

939
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm ready to take questions.

940
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Before

941
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the Q&A,

942
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
let's give a round of

943
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
applause to Wen-Cheng

944
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
for his wonderful speech.

945
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Of course,

946
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
if you have any questions,

947
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
you can

948
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
open the microphone to ask.

949
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Is there

950
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
any question?

951
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Actually, I have a question.

952
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Let me ask a question first.

953
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Sorry.

954
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
OK.

955
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Can I

956
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
ask you a question?

957
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Sorry.

958
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
OK.

959
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Very nice talk.

960
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The result is

961
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
very exciting.

962
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I want to ask

963
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
about

964
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
the following

965
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
work.

966
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
T1 is

967
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
102 microseconds

968
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
under the protective state.

969
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I want to ask

970
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
if you have studied

971
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
what limiting factor

972
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
limits it to

973
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
102 microseconds.

974
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yes.

975
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Basically,

976
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
it is...

977
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It is

978
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
junction symmetry.

979
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
In short, it is junction symmetry.

980
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
If the two junctions

981
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
are not symmetric,

982
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
it will affect

983
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
the original T1.

984
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Even unprotected state

985
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
will affect T1.

986
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes.

987
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I don't think

988
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I put it here.

989
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Basically,

990
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
if these two junctions

991
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
have either oxidation

992
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
or size asymmetry,

993
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
it will

994
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
limit T1.

995
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Is it different from

996
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
dielectric loss

997
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
limitation?

998
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Is it?

999
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It is not caused by

1000
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
two-level system.

1001
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
At least,

1002
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
in modeling,

1003
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
they know better.

1004
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
According to their feedback,

1005
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in modeling,

1006
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
asymmetry will have a big impact.

1007
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Asymmetry can be

1008
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
from our...

1009
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We can look at it

1010
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
with a squeegee.

1011
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We can

1012
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
look at

1013
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
asymmetry

1014
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
at the lowest point

1015
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
of the field.

1016
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Our equipment is bad.

1017
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
We make

1018
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
asymmetry,

1019
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
put it in modeling,

1020
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and push it out.

1021
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It tells us

1022
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
our equipment is bad.

1023
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Or

1024
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
maybe not.

1025
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The junction symmetry

1026
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
is more particular.

1027
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We must use two junctions.

1028
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The asymmetry of these two junctions

1029
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
is quite critical.

1030
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I have a question.

1031
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
What is your

1032
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
asymmetry?

1033
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For example,

1034
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
your asymmetry

1035
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
can be parameterized.

1036
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
For example,

1037
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
in Squid,

1038
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
there is a defect.

1039
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
How much

1040
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
difference

1041
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
is there?

1042
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Ideally,

1043
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
what is the difference?

1044
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We use

1045
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
gigahertz.

1046
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
0.6 gigahertz.

1047
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So your

1048
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
delta

1049
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
is about

1050
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
0.4 gigahertz.

1051
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I see.

1052
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
There is no difference.

1053
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Asymmetry

1054
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
is a must

1055
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
for junction.

1056
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Our

1057
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
situation is

1058
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
that

1059
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
our device

1060
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
must have these two junctions.

1061
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You can't just make one.

1062
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You have to have both.

1063
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
If you make one,

1064
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
there will be such a problem.

1065
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The device

1066
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
is particular about delta.

1067
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It takes time to tune.

1068
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
If you don't mind,

1069
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I have a second question.

1070
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Why your

1071
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
super inductor

1072
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
junction

1073
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
is

1074
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
a two-angle junction?

1075
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It looks like

1076
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
a rotating-angle junction,

1077
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
not a

1078
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
stolen-bridge junction.

1079
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Unlike what we did

1080
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in Maryland.

1081
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Our boss doesn't like

1082
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
stolen-bridge junction.

1083
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
He thinks

1084
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
our junction

1085
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
won't be broken.

1086
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So I want to fix it,

1087
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
but my boss says it's too slow.

1088
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Is your

1089
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
blow-dry

1090
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
like a trick?

1091
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
What?

1092
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Do you have a special trick

1093
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
when you blow-dry?

1094
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I remember that

1095
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
top-mask

1096
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
was a PMMA

1097
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
last year.

1098
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It collapsed when I blow-dry it.

1099
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I couldn't finish it in 4 or 5 years.

1100
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
My boss told me not to do it again.

1101
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So I want to ask you.

1102
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
According to

1103
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
normal

1104
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
fab,

1105
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
our yield

1106
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
is quite high.

1107
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
As long as

1108
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
the first step is OK,

1109
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and the next step is OK,

1110
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
it's usually

1111
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
not a problem.

1112
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's usually not a problem.

1113
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
No, we just can't do it.

1114
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I've been doing it for

1115
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
a week, and my boss said

1116
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
there's nothing special

1117
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
to fix.

1118
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Nothing special.

1119
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
OK.

1120
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I see.

1121
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'll let others

1122
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
ask questions.

1123
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Thank you.

1124
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I have a question.

1125
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Can you go back to

1126
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
TC?

1127
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
TC and

1128
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
granularized.

1129
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
My question is

1130
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
for different

1131
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
samples,

1132
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
do you know

1133
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the delta

1134
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
bandgap?

1135
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Is it almost

1136
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
the same?

1137
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Or not?

1138
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I didn't test it.

1139
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
But you feed

1140
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Matisse-Bardini

1141
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and you get the value.

1142
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Oh, no, sorry.

1143
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This TC is independent.

1144
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I just use it

1145
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
to test TC.

1146
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh, I see.

1147
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So each data is

1148
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
transported by TC.

1149
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And there's no microwave.

1150
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Matisse-Bardini uses microwave.

1151
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Right.

1152
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So we don't...

1153
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Suppose

1154
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
there should be

1155
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
a resonator chip.

1156
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Suppose

1157
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
if it's 100% Matisse-Bardini,

1158
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it should be exactly the same.

1159
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
But we're worried

1160
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
because we don't know

1161
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
how much of it is not Matisse-Bardini.

1162
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We're curious.

1163
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah, that's

1164
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
a very good point.

1165
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But in that case,

1166
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
if it's

1167
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
what you want to do,

1168
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
you don't want it to be Matisse-Bardini.

1169
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You want the

1170
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
alpha factor to be high.

1171
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You want it to

1172
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
deviate from Matisse-Bardini.

1173
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Not necessarily.

1174
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But I hope

1175
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
if it really comes from

1176
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the energy deposit,

1177
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
it can still break the pair.

1178
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Then I can test the documenter.

1179
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Otherwise, it reacts a lot

1180
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
but it's useless

1181
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
if it doesn't interact with the particle.

1182
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Interesting.

1183
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
OK.

1184
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
My understanding is

1185
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
if it follows BCS,

1186
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
it's Matisse-Bardini.

1187
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We haven't

1188
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
thought about it.

1189
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
At least the first part,

1190
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
the alpha factor is good.

1191
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We've demonstrated this part.

1192
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
As you can see,

1193
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
we want to test it because of this.

1194
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But we're worried

1195
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
if it doesn't interact

1196
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
with the physical particle

1197
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
in a normal response,

1198
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
it becomes a very powerful

1199
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
but it only reacts with RF.

1200
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's useless.

1201
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
OK.

1202
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Because what I did before

1203
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
is HKID.

1204
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The pair I read before

1205
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
is more HKID.

1206
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I haven't thought about it.

1207
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
OK.

1208
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
OK.

1209
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
OK.

1210
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
As I said last time,

1211
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
in low resistivity,

1212
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
it usually follows

1213
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
strictly

1214
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Matisse-Bardini.

1215
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
If you push it

1216
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
to close to 800

1217
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
or 1000

1218
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Michael-Henry per square,

1219
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
sorry,

1220
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
you'll get

1221
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
a nonlinear phenomenon.

1222
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It makes sense.

1223
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's in line with the prediction.

1224
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's not Matisse-Bardini.

1225
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yes.

1226
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
OK.

1227
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
This is my question.

1228
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Do you have any other questions?

1229
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
If you don't have any questions,

1230
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
please turn on

1231
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
the microphone.

1232
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
OK.

1233
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Now I...
