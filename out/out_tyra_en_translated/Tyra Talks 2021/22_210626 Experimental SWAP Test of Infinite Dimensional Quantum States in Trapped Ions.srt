1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you all for coming to today's Taira Talk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today's speaker is Zeng Kewei, who graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
After that, he did a PhD in quantum computing experiments in Singapore's CQT.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He wanted to do quantum computing because he won the Nobel Prize for quantum computing.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I remember when I won the Nobel Prize in 2012, I was wondering what was going on in this field.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I remember that the story really started like this.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My high school teacher can testify for this, not me.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Today, he will mainly talk about the control beam splitter technology.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Today's topic is Experimental Swap Test in Infinite Dimensional Quantum State.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's start with Kewei.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Before we start, let's turn on the microphone and give a round of applause.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll leave the time to you, Kewei.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No problem.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Can everyone see this laser pen?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Can you see this laser pen?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This laser dot.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you for listening to my talk today.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm Kewei.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What I'm going to talk about today is the Exponential Swap Test of Infinite Dimensional Quantum System.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is an experiment in quantum computing.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Of course, I will talk about the theoretical background of quantum computing.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then talk about quantum computing as a whole.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I will use the infinite dimensional system, which is not a common quantum element.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We use the quantum vibrational mode to do this.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will first talk about the general quantum computer.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then talk about the quantum computer using quantum vibration.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you want to do quantum computing, you have to be able to use those gates and logic to do the calculation.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After talking about some of the standards of quantum computing, we will talk about the pros and cons of our lab.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or our killer key is that we can make control gates.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
After talking about the theoretical part, we will talk about what we do in our lab.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let me talk about this slowly.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The first thing is to start with the scientific part.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What is quantum computing?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If we just look at the general situation, we can say that quantum computing is not just pointing to 0 or 1.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It is not just pointing to the North Pole or the South Pole.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It can point to any place between 0 and 1, including 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In addition to 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1, it can also point to 0 plus i1 or 0 minus i1.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is not just a number, it can become a negative number.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The first concept of quantum computing is that its quantum state is a negative number.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because it is now a negative number, it can be between 0 and 1.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is why we often hear this addition state.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's amazing to hear the addition state.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You see that one quantum element can have two addition states.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
100 quantum elements will have 200 and 100 qubits.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is a big number.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is it because it can be obtained by parallel computing?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course not.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The main reason is that when you actually measure, you randomly find an answer from these addition states.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you can't find the correct answer and select it, the result of your measurement is a random result.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can't just get the effect of quantum computing through addition states.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So parallel is not enough.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you hear the complex number and the superposition, if you are doing quantum computing, you will feel that it sounds very similar to the electromagnetic wave.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because if you use the addition state for the Maxwell equation, if you are in a rectangular or even just using a drum today,

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This drum can also have superposition.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It can have different tones.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It can have different tones, and the tonal mathematical structure can also be expressed in complex numbers.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The answer is whether you have measured this part.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the first thing.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you have an electromagnetic wave in addition state today, you will not be able to measure the electromagnetic wave.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The electromagnetic wave suddenly says that I only have 100 Hz left.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The part of 200 Hz is gone.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the first feature.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The second feature is that quantum is not just one quantum element.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's so interesting.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The point is that it has to be entangled.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It must have this entanglement between this quantum state or its connectivity.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Of course, we are talking about Schrodinger.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me talk a little bit.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But let's start with entanglement.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Entanglement will make the quantum state have a very strong connection, but not a cause and effect relationship.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Although its connection is still in the quantum space, so in the time and space, in our universe, it can be in a very far place.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There is a very strong connection.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But it can't do superlight transmission.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So you won't see this kind of destruction.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It is a correlation, not a causality.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is something that needs to be emphasized.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So quantum computing simply relies on the parallel superposition.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It has to have a strong connection between these states.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This strong connection, you would think that it may not be a problem in a small space.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If there is an electron pointing up, the other electron must point down.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
On the contrary, if it points down, the other point up.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There seems to be nothing.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's just a very strong connection.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But the problem is that if you let this connection run from the small world to the big world today, it feels like a very interesting situation.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's look at the picture on the right.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If the first case is that your element is above or below, it may trigger a whole complex system.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In the end, this cat will be in a state of death and fire.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It is often seen in Schrödinger's cat.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you look at this up, it means that if you go up, the poison gas will not be opened.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So the cat is smiling.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If it is down, the poison gas bottle will be broken.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is the case of crying.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So if you can use some physical mechanisms to slowly extend the interesting situation of small worlds through a bunch of chain reactions to the big world.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You will often see this Schrödinger cat.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The interesting thing about Schrödinger's cat is not just that the cat can be in a state of death and fire, but that you can make the small world of quantum mechanics look very magical.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
These strong connections can be extended to the big world step by step.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because the cat does not suddenly become a death and fire.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It must be through a certain kind of macro situation to slowly make it in a state of entanglement with small things.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's how we see this Schrödinger cat.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Of course, we do not see a human or a cat in a state of death and fire in the real world.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is an interesting situation.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That is to say, when a huge object interacts with the outside world, it produces decoherence.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In other words, maybe overall it is still a quantum type.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:55,000
However, if you have a big system called a cat, the exchange of information between the cat and the outside world will not be able to describe the cat in a pure state.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It seems to have lost the outside information, which is called decoherence.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This decoherence can be said to be the place where we talk about entropy in many places.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can say that the interaction between the system and the outside world produces decoherence from this decoherence.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In fact, it is the measurement mentioned in the front page.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It is a special process.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In fact, it is just an interaction between the system and the outside world.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The result of the interaction is that you only have the information of this system.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It is no longer a pure quantum state.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Because it is not a pure quantum state, it will produce entropy when you describe this quantum state.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Some people may know that a pure quantum state has no entropy.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you take the whole universe as a wave function, it will not have entropy if it is completely evolved according to quantum mechanics.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It will not have decoherence.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But we can see decoherence and entropy locally.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is a place where we can talk about it in a special way.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The last thing I want to say is that quantum mechanics is so interesting.

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It has entanglement and superposition.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Through entanglement, we can solve all the problems faster than the index.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Of course, it is not like this.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We can only solve a few problems and only solve different situations.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The first category is whether we can find a problem.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But it hides some cycle patterns.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
As long as it is a hidden periodic function, you can use show arithmetic or a similar family.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The key point is that you can do this kind of entanglement conversion.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can extract its cycle information.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So if you have a hidden cycle information,

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Show and a similar algorithm can solve this problem faster than the index.

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Of course, this is very important, but it is also a good definition and a definition limit.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It does not solve any problem.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you have a hidden periodic function,

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Of course, this is also directly related to the encryption method of the national defense industry.

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because we often see this kind of elliptic encryption or RSA encryption.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Will be directly attacked by show.

139
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It should be said that show was proposed in 1995 and 1996.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Show arithmetic is also the reason why the whole quantum computing or quantum computer will develop rapidly.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can say that 1995 was the year of quantum computing.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Show can solve this periodic problem.

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Is there anyone else who can find something interesting?

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The answer is yes.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So Grover said that if we want to do it today,

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
For example, if we want to search for the name of a telephone book and its phone number,

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It has nothing to do with any hidden internal relationship.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If you want to search for a search without any structure,

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can use Grover to make your search faster.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The number of times you need to search will be multiplied by the number of times you need to search.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The interesting thing behind it is that you can actually use quantum random walk.

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can use this kind of random walk that you often see in traditional computing.

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because in general, if you add some random to this CS algorithm,

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You will make it perform better.

155
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In fact, Grover's quantum random walk is a one-sided relationship.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But Grover can only be faster than the number of times.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It can't be faster than the number of times.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you have no knowledge of the problem you want to search for,

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Grover has been proven to be quantum optimized.

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It can't do better.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you want to search for some internal structure,

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can use some special algorithms to do better than Grover.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
For example, if you want to find if there is a triangle in a pile of patterns,

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We know that a triangle needs three sides and three corners.

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Because the pattern you are looking for today may have some internal connections.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It can do better than Grover.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But if you don't know if you want to find this data,

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Grover can do the best.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
These two are the algorithms produced by Shor and Grover in 1995 and 1996.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is there anything interesting in the past 1, 2, 10 years?

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The answer is yes.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
HHL algorithm, or matrix inversion,

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It is a big breakthrough in 2009.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In the early days, we thought that HHL algorithm,

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It can be faster than the classical number of times.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Because it is faster than the classical number of times.

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you can calculate the matrix inversion faster than the number of times,

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It means you can calculate linear regression faster than the number of times.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It also means that you can calculate all kinds of interesting quantum mechanics,

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Including PCA, SVM, etc.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So HHL is one of the core of quantum mechanics.

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It was originally estimated to be faster than the number of times.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But unfortunately, in 2019,

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Someone proved that the classical number of times can be faster than the classical number of times.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If some quantum tricks are used in the classical number of times,

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The classical number of times is wider, but the quantum equivalent is not faster than the number of times.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's only ten times faster.

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So we now say that HHL is a bit of a quantum speedup.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Its quantum speedup is not so high.

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Its acceleration from the level of Shor becomes the level of Grover.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's still great, it's still fast, but it's not so fancy.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That is to say, the quantum algorithm can only solve three problems in general.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Find the cycle, find the data search, and find the inverse matrix.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It can't solve the problem of arbitrary,

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There is no such thing.

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But there are currently three major categories.

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then this is probably the part of the background we are talking about today.

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That is to say, if quantum is something interesting,

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It can have additional states.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But one additional state is not fun.

201
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It must have a bunch of entanglement.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Then you can see those interesting things.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What is the specific algorithm of entanglement?

204
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You will see quantum Fourier transform, quantum random walk, and HHL.

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is probably the part of the background introduction.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay, then we'll find this.

207
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This thing sounds very scientific, very mathematical.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We have to find a real physical object.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You can run, for example, what is 0 plus 1 or 0 minus 1.

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This kind of quantum element.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We have to find one.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In fact, we can operate it.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Really let it produce entanglement.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let it produce entanglement.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
These quantum logic operations for us.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So we have to find a physical object.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because this world is that we are not living in the field of HHL.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We live in the world of matter.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So we have to find the material to do this thing.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So now there are two or a few more leading.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are two more famous.

222
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
One is to do it with a quantum well.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Or do it with a super-mass chip.

224
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The quantum well on the left is what I did in CQT.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is the experiment.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We are using a more primitive way of doing this.

227
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So when you hear the chip ion,

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The first thing you want to say is that you want to use one by one.

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You use one by one of the quantum in this vacuum.

230
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
How do you catch the quantum?

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why can I do this thing?

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because it's not like you can clip it with pliers or something.

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You have to think about why you can catch a quantum.

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So the first question is that we can catch it.

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The answer is that we can't take a quantum.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hanging in a space without moving.

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Because this violates Gauss's law.

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If you simply operate it through the power plant,

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It must be in a certain space.

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is Gauss's law.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So you can't let it stop at a point.

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But linear potentiometer,

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
After you let it have an AC current,

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It can have an average confinement time.

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It is called Ponder Multi Potential in the professional field.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But we can use very simple.

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We should do this thing by watching this video.

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This doesn't look very good.

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wait a minute.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay, now you can put it.

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So what we can see at this time is that

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You have a quantum in a vibrating plant.

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can catch the quantum in a certain place without moving.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So the first problem is solved.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We know how to produce quantum.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
After we catch a quantum,

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Remove one of its electrons.

258
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then we go through a vibrating battery plant.

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can catch it in space without moving.

260
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So the first two quantum can be caught.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There is no problem.

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What are the advantages of quantum?

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are the benefits of saying that we caught it?

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The first one is that the quantum lives in a very, very high vacuum.

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's probably 10 to the 12th square.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not a problem.

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
How vacuum is it?

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's more than what we see.

269
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The degree of vacuum is more than the track between the earth and the moon.

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Low-Earth vacuum is still vacuum.

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So if you look at the international space station,

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The degree of vacuum outside is not as good as the vacuum in our lab.

273
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's still vacuum.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So this vacuum is basically

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If the system is stable enough,

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The quantum is able to live for a few months.

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's not a problem.

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We have a quantum.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We caught this quantum once.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's been alive for about half a year.

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
From September last year to March this year.

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Until one time, one accident, it's gone.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So it can live very long in this situation.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It won't interact with the background.

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So it won't have a lot of strange noises.

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Or it won't be affected by the outside environment.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Quantum computing needs these intangibles.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's very fragile.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's best to live in an environment where it doesn't interact with the outside world.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But we can manipulate it.

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How to manipulate it, I'll talk about it later.

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But it doesn't have any background interaction that we don't want.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The second is that when you catch a bunch of quantum,

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Every quantum looks the same.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You won't find that my quantum,

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
For example, after my quantum, my quantum,

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's not the same as the other one.

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because quantum is essentially through nature.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Instead of through artificial production.

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So we don't have to adjust the nature of each quantum.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because if the nature of the quantum is different,

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Then we have a big problem.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's the same for every one you catch.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This also means that if we use this system to catch this quantum,

305
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We can use this system.

306
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If we use this system to catch and operate,

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We can use this whole system to deal with another quantum.

308
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It basically has no problem.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We don't need to adjust each one or measure it.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Basically not necessary.

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Another feature of quantum is that,

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Because it is through the battery factory,

313
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Every one has electricity.

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In the case that every one has electricity,

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Every one can directly auto or connect in the same trap.

316
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That is to say, if you catch 10 quantum today,

317
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can directly let the first quantum and the tenth quantum have an entanglement.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You don't have to say that I have to do this through 1, 2, 2, 3.

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because in theory, they are actually in this trap.

320
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They can all see each other.

321
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This thing can make the complexity of quantum computing much lower.

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
As long as you don't need a bunch of complicated quantum,

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can make your experiment more accurate.

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because we all know that quantum computing is not perfect now.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
As long as you keep doing all kinds of quantum logic,

326
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You just let your error rate rise.

327
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Basically, the quantum computing of the quantum system is in this.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because of these good qualities,

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Its quantum logic is in single qubit rotation.

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
About 99.999 is not a difficult thing.

331
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In the case of 2-qubit, which requires entanglement,

332
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
98 or 99 is not difficult to do in a normal lab.

333
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It can be very easy to do very high quality in a small number of small systems.

334
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This is the characteristic of the quantum system.

335
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How do you do a lot of them?

336
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is not the scope of our discussion today.

337
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We know that it is very good if it is small, there is no problem.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But there are hundreds of kinds of quantum.

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We open the element cycle table and it looks like there are more than 100 kinds.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So why do we choose Eterbium?

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What are the benefits of Eterbium?

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The first one is that if we look at it now,

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There is a hyperfine cube in the lower left corner.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The place where we define 0 and 1 is here.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What are the benefits of it?

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This Eterbium 171,

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Its nucleus is a spin half.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Its nucleus has a 1 in 2 spin.

349
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So the result is that it will produce a hyperfine cube.

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It is very natural, like a straight line or a straight line.

351
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So it is a hyperfine cube.

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The second is that if you kick off one electron,

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What is the layer of the outer chain?

354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So there are not many cases where you kick off the first one and it is full.

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So your first requirement is that if you want to have a hyperfine,

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then you want to kick off one electron,

357
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The outer chain is full.

358
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
At the same time, you also hope that in the process of your experiment,

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Your nucleus will not go to any strange place.

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
For example, if we put the nucleus here,

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Through this experiment,

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It may have a part of the probability to get here.

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
When it gets here, we'll figure out a way to kick it back.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That is, we can kick it back through 935 and 638.

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You have to make sure that you can find your nucleus back to where it wants to be.

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can initialize it to where you want it to be.

367
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This is quite important.

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because you don't want to say that it has all kinds of good qualities,

369
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But after you do the experiment, you don't know what kind of strange state your nucleus has gone to.

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Of course, another important point is that

371
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You hope that the laser you do the experiment can be bought on the market,

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Or at least it's not very exaggerated.

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For example, our laser here is 369 nm.

374
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If your laser is 500 to 1000 nm,

375
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's very, very good.

376
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That is to say, the range of visible light is very good.

377
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Although 369 nm is already very close to the blue light,

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's a little bit of an outline, but it can still be done.

379
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Whether or not you can do the experiment with a sold laser,

380
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It will also affect whether or not you can do a good amount of electricity.

381
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So you can express it in various ways.

382
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It meets a series of good qualities.

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It is a spin-1 in 2.

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
After it kicks off an electricity,

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The outer layer is full of electricity.

386
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Its various complex connections can be easily

387
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We can simplify it to just look at the connection at the bottom left.

388
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
As long as we have those auxiliary lasers,

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It can be regarded as non-existent.

390
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
At the same time, it mainly operates 369 nm.

391
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This frequency can be bought on the market.

392
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So why do we choose to use Ethereum?

393
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Ethereum does not have a very long history.

394
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was probably around the 2010s

395
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It was established by Chris Monore, a professor at the University of Maryland.

396
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It is to use Ethereum to use its 369 nm

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Transition to do all kinds of quantum computing operations.

398
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So why is Ethereum a good reason?

399
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's talk about why the reason system is a good system.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why is Ethereum a good reason?

401
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
After the two-step logic is completed,

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But the reason system can only be a small system.

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If we want to simulate a large

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What should we do if we need a lot of Hewlett-Packard space?

405
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So the first simple way is to say

406
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Each of our particles has a spin-down and a spin-up

407
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
One 0 and one 1

408
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Then we can make it

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's just find a bunch of particles.

410
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We have n particles

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So in this case, our total Hewlett-Packard space is 2n square.

412
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Sounds good

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But can we find a faster way?

414
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Maybe there is

415
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Your particle is

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
In addition to the ability to pick up,

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The particle will vibrate.

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Because we just said

419
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We are using this

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This

421
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We are adding an AC power plant

422
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let this particle be in vacuum

423
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Affected by this power plant

424
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then after the back and forth vibration, the waiting price is restrained there.

425
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This means that the particle will vibrate.

426
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The vibration of this particle is also a quantum.

427
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In theory, you can put a quantum

428
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You can put two

429
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You can put three

430
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You can put n quantum

431
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So you can put a lot of quantum in every quantum

432
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Theoretically, it is infinite.

433
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
In practice, of course, it is limited.

434
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So the reason why my paper is said to be this

435
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The reason for this SWAP test in Infinite Dimension is because

436
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
We are using a quantum

437
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We are not using 0 and 1 as a calculation standard

438
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What does this mean?

439
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Look here

440
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The mainstream approach

441
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We can say that this is more common

442
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We have a lot of 0s and 1s

443
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
A lot of 0s and 1s

444
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You are on the top of this side

445
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Then this kind of vibration

446
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like a bus

447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Responsible for the information from the left to the right

448
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's like it's a

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
After you finish the calculation, you will be forgotten

450
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I want to hope that it is

451
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Not as a

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Support function

453
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But what you have to think about is

454
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Every quantum has only two dimensions

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But it contains this

456
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Continuous Variable

457
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Or its Vibration Normal

458
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Its vibration is an infinite dimension

459
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Can you turn their characters upside down?

460
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That is to say

461
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Let you

462
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This part of the infinite dimension

463
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It becomes a storage and calculation character for quantum computing

464
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let this two-dimensional system

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It becomes a quantum bus character

466
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If you turn it upside down

467
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Maybe we can use the same system

468
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But this can be done

469
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Can manipulate a lot of

470
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's a lot of quantum dimensions

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So this is possible

472
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then there is another point

473
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's special to say

474
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Why do I seem to switch

475
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This infinite dimension

476
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Interact with Continuous Variable

477
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Your infinite dimension

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This matter is seen through its vibration

479
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That is to say, one vibration, two vibrations

480
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It can go to the infinite dimension

481
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The reason for the Continuous Variable

482
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This vibration

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If you look at it with quantum

484
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It is in x and p space

485
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It is in the phase space

486
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Is a continuous situation

487
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So this infinite dimension

488
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
With this continuous variable

489
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This matter is exactly the same

490
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's not that I don't seem to get it

491
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Just

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
People in quantum will prefer to say

493
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It is x, it is infinite dimension

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But if you are from the light system today

495
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You are doing quantum light

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You might be saying

497
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This is a continuous variable

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
OK

499
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So now we know

500
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Can you open it?

501
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
No problem

502
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I want to ask

503
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That one of yours

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Motion state is also

505
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The direction of x is still

506
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Is the direction of radio

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This

508
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We are all using the direction of radio

509
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
OK

510
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We are not using X

511
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
OK

512
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Thank you

513
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The main reason is because

514
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Our experiment is

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Need a few vibrational modes

516
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Interaction between

517
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Then X

518
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
If we pull to the front page

519
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is to say

520
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You each

521
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There will be three vibrations

522
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But his three

523
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
There are two directions

524
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Is radio

525
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Is

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Is

527
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You can say it is horizontal

528
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Then one is horizontal

529
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So you use this

530
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Horizontal vibration

531
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He has more

532
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He has more

533
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He can also choose

534
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We won't choose

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Like here

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The two he drew here

537
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Both are

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
X

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But we don't use these two

540
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
These two are just memories

541
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We use radio

542
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Correct

543
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
OK

544
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So

545
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is it because of radio

546
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
His ability to separate

547
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Probably with his weight

548
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Separate

549
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The range is probably where

550
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Is there

551
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Probably all in

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Kilohertz

553
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Megahertz

554
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Radio

555
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Probably up to

556
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
0.5 or up to 5

557
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It is possible

558
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Then generally speaking

559
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
X will be smaller

560
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Because

561
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
X it is not

562
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
X it is from that

563
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Cap to confine

564
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It is clamped by two electrons

565
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Generally speaking

566
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We

567
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Uh

568
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Our X

569
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
His

570
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
His

571
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Frequency

572
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
His that

573
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
His frequency is smaller

574
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Correct

575
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Of course this is not

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Why don't we choose him

577
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The reason is right

578
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Correct

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Understand

580
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So simply put

581
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Say yes

582
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
OK

583
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So simply put

584
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Just pull it back

585
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Just say good

586
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We now know this

587
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This computer

588
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
To do it with a microscope

589
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Very good

590
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But the speed of ether

591
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Maybe there is no

592
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This kind of vibration

593
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Better

594
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So we decided to use

595
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Vibration of ether

596
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
To do experiments

597
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
After that

598
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We want to say

599
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then we have to make sure

600
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He can do quantum computers

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is the quantum computer

602
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is a series of requirements

603
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
First

604
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You have to make sure you can

605
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Your quantum information

606
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The subset can be more and more

607
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
For example

608
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
If your spin has 2

609
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can find

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
For example, more

611
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Two spins

612
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You can find a very large

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Kilohertz

614
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You can find a very large

615
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
This quantum space

616
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This thing

617
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Can be done in spin

618
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That in quantum information

619
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In this

620
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Of course I can do it too

621
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So theoretically

622
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
We can catch

623
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
A vibration

624
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You can catch two

625
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Vibration of ether

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You can catch

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You can catch a vibration

628
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This quantum

629
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You can catch two

630
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You can catch three

631
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So he

632
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Scalable

633
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The first one is fine

634
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The second

635
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He can last a long time

636
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Coherence time

637
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He must not

638
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He must not be easy

639
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's easy to interact with the outside world

640
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
This thing

641
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
In spin

642
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Can last

643
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Ten minutes

644
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This is a pretty exaggerated world record

645
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What about the vibration

646
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It can only last about

647
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Ten to twenty milliseconds

648
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
One millisecond

649
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Is one thousandth of a second

650
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But it's been a long time

651
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because our experiment

652
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Faster than this

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The rest is more standard

654
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's what we want

655
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Can we go

656
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Effectively go to this

657
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Put it

658
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Initialization in a certain place

659
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I said we hope

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
When we start

661
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We can know where he is

662
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So we do

663
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
All kinds of operations

664
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's how it will be

665
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
To the place we want to go

666
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Of course you

667
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can put it

668
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
To a certain place

669
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let him

670
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
After all kinds of operations

671
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You have to be able to read it

672
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
How can you read it

673
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The answer is also

674
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Is

675
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Initialization skills

676
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And reading skills

677
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Use spin

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
To read

679
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This

680
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
With spin

681
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
With continuous

682
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's the same

683
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This technology

684
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In

685
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This technology

686
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In this

687
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Whether you use this

688
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's the same

689
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The real point is

690
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Is that

691
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Can you find the middle one

692
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Can operate

693
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Vibration

694
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That kind of logic

695
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
How do you make logic

696
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Or the most difficult place

697
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
OK

698
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So let's go to the next place

699
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I want to see

700
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That is to say

701
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
In the case of QB

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We see the logic

703
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You may see it more often

704
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That is to say

705
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We have a single QB

706
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We can turn it

707
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
At the beginning

708
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
QB is like a

709
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
North and south

710
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This

711
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
If the North Pole is 0 and the South Pole is 1

712
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You can see above

713
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Turn around on the surface

714
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The first one is

715
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
If you have only one

716
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Just turn it

717
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That

718
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If you can do it

719
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Any quantum state

720
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You have to be able to do

721
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Any quantum

722
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This

723
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
This

724
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If you need this result

726
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You also need one

727
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Can control two

728
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
quantum

729
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What about our common practice

730
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That is

731
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is the first one

732
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is this controlled

733
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Then the second one

734
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Is controlled

735
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You can do

736
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If the first one is 0

737
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The first one is 0

738
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If the second one is 0

739
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's still 0 0

740
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's his logic

741
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's a simple output

742
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This situation

743
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That

744
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
QB is the quantum

745
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
In the binary system

746
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Can do this

747
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What if we have a

748
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What if we have an infinite system

749
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So we have the situation on the right

750
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like this

751
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Single QB

752
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It corresponds to a series of

753
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
All kinds of different things

754
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What is this

755
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Displacement

756
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Rotation

757
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Squeeze in

758
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Bean splitter

759
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
These

760
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It corresponds to this single QB

761
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This

762
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You can say

763
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Continuous

764
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Continuous

765
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
These basic

766
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
This is the basic tool

767
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But it needs a

768
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Very important point

769
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The most difficult thing is

770
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
If you want to do this

771
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Non-linear

772
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
If you want to do that

773
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Can let

774
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Between the two

775
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
To produce

776
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This is

777
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This is

778
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
This is the trouble

779
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So the next point

780
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
We have to say

781
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, then we

782
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Which one do we choose

783
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
To do this

784
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We have to choose

785
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Control swap gate

786
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What about the control swap gate

787
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
There are three quantum

788
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The first one is spin

789
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Is our

790
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Quantum box

791
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There is a quantum behind

792
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
There is a quantum behind

793
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's called A

794
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
There is a quantum called B

795
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it is good

796
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If you go through this

797
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Control swap

798
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It if this

799
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It if this middle

800
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This quantum

801
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
This spin

802
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
This box

803
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It belongs to

804
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Spin down

805
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It won't

806
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It won't do any action

807
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But if it spins up

808
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It can put two quantum

809
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Exchange

810
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's very simple

811
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
If today

812
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Your indicator

813
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If it's down

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
No action

815
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If the indicator is up

816
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Exchange

817
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It seems to be very specific, right?

818
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Of course what to do

819
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If you today

820
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You have this very simple

821
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
this

822
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Gate is that you can do this

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Howdermann

824
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
this

825
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If you spin the spin

826
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Then you do it at the same time

827
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This is a swap

828
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
gate

829
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You can get

830
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You can get these two

831
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Unknown quantity

832
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
How similar it is

833
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But attention

834
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You don't need to know the quantity

835
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
It doesn't have to know

836
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Quantity B

837
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You go straight to measure

838
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This quantum box

839
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You can find these two

840
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you

841
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You get these two

842
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Quantity

843
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
How similar it is

844
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's right

845
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So this

846
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So this

847
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
This

848
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He can give us this

849
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This circuit

850
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It means

851
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We can

852
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We can now

853
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Unknown two

854
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The details

855
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
In the case of details

856
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But you know

857
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
How similar these two

858
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
How similar it is

859
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
This is actually very good

860
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Because that is to say

861
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Sometimes we are just curious

862
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Our results

863
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
For example, the two of them

864
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Is it

865
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Similar quantum

866
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But we

867
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
For its details

868
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Maybe not so much

869
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But the previous situation was

870
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You might want to know first

871
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What does A look like

872
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What does B look like

873
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
To know how similar A and B are

874
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But you can now

875
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's very simple

876
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Just know how similar it is

877
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And you don't need to know

878
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What are their details

879
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
OK

880
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Ok

881
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then next

882
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then next

883
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This

884
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
In theory, we need

885
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
This is very simple

886
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This

887
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We need this

888
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Complex control swap gate

889
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It involves

890
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
One

891
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Spin and two

892
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Motional mode

893
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Two oscillators

894
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That

895
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
In theory

896
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That's what it was like in 2001

897
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But in practice

898
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's not that simple

899
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because we have something in practice

900
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
It's called the control bin splitter gate

901
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's very similar to the control swap gate

902
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But it's not the same

903
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What's the difference

904
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You'll find out

905
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
If you use the middle one now

906
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
This

907
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
If you use Hamiltonian for evolution

908
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You put X and Y

909
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It will turn into Y and X

910
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's right

911
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But there's one more thing in front of it

912
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Very annoying to us

913
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This

914
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This face

915
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This

916
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This

917
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Uh

918
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This face is here

919
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Because we know

920
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The quantum world

921
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's a negative number

922
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So of course it can produce this

923
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
This kind of virtual

924
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This face is here

925
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
We need to find a way

926
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Get rid of this face

927
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
When it only becomes X and Y

928
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It becomes Y and X

929
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No need Y and X

930
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Plus a very annoying face

931
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
How do you do this

932
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The answer is that we need three gates

933
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We need three modes

934
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
We put what we want

935
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This measurement thing

936
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Ready in mode B and mode C

937
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And then we let mode B and mode A

938
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Interact

939
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let mode A and mode C interact

940
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Its final result will be mode B

941
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Interact with mode C

942
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But its face

943
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This face will be miraculously eliminated

944
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So you only need two

945
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Control beam splitter

946
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And then you have three modes

947
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You can do it

948
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Just now we said

949
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
We really want to see this

950
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We can know

951
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
How similar are the two quantum states

952
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But

953
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Uh

954
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But you don't need to know

955
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The details of these two quantum states

956
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Of course, a very important point

957
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
No matter how complicated these two quantum states are

958
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The measurement process is the same

959
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's the same time

960
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You're not going to say

961
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
My quantum state is bigger

962
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So I'm going to need more steps

963
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
No need

964
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The quantum state may require more steps

965
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But whether the two quantum states are similar

966
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This thing

967
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It is a constant deep circuit

968
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Its length is stable

969
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
OK

970
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This thing is pretty important

971
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because it

972
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This thing is far more than this

973
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
SPIN system

974
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Uh, efficiency

975
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Of course, its

976
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Its fidelity will not be higher

977
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Because this is a relatively new system

978
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It will have all kinds of infidelity

979
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You'll see later

980
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Where is it imperfect

981
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So

982
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's very simple

983
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We only need two control bin splitters

984
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
With three modes

985
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We can get this

986
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We just

987
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hope to get this

988
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The core of this

989
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Control swap gate

990
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
OK

991
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Can I ask a question?

992
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Good question

993
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Because I don't know much about this system

994
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So can you tell me a little bit

995
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Physically

996
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
How did you do it?

997
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Control bin splitter gate

998
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Uh

999
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm going to the next page

1000
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Ok

1001
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Ok, I'm going to the next page

1002
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The next page is physics

1003
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We just said so much

1004
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's like you said

1005
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What can you do with a Hamiltonian

1006
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What kind of result will it have

1007
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What is its physical situation

1008
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Very simple

1009
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We now

1010
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I just

1011
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Uh

1012
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Every

1013
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Every particle is in

1014
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's in

1015
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Every particle is in

1016
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There will be a vibration in the z direction

1017
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There will be two vibrations in the x and y direction

1018
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Then we said we need three vibration states

1019
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So we can only use the x and y direction at this time

1020
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We caught two

1021
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
After the particle

1022
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's in the x and y direction

1023
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
There are four vibrations in total

1024
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We used three of them

1025
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Called Moe ABC respectively

1026
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
What about this Moe ABC

1027
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
What if we go at the same time

1028
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Uh

1029
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you apply this Moe AB and AC

1030
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That is to say

1031
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
If we have this

1032
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If we laser this

1033
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Bichrome

1034
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That is to say

1035
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We applied this laser

1036
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It has

1037
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
We applied the laser

1038
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's not a single frequency

1039
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's two frequencies

1040
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And if it's between the two frequencies

1041
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The interval is this

1042
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
380kHz

1043
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Or 490kHz

1044
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It can

1045
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It can

1046
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It can successfully go

1047
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Drive

1048
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Just what we want

1049
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
This one

1050
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Control beam speed

1051
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What is control beam speed

1052
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That is to say

1053
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I let

1054
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
One more x

1055
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Then let b less than one

1056
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This concept

1057
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So

1058
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You just let your

1059
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This frequency driving is

1060
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Difference

1061
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's

1062
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's the difference between the two modes

1063
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It will automatically become

1064
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Like the one we just had

1065
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This control

1066
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
This situation

1067
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So our physical system

1068
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is that we catch two particles

1069
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Let him use it

1070
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There are four vibration

1071
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Choose three of them

1072
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And then

1073
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Let one of the particles

1074
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's in a special state

1075
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It won't interact with our experiment

1076
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It simply contributes to the vibration

1077
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It won't

1078
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Contribute to its

1079
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This energy level

1080
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's just

1081
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I can't see it going somewhere else

1082
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
What about the last one that I can see

1083
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Let's go

1084
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Let's go

1085
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Use this

1086
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
This post laser to drive it

1087
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Do this

1088
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Control beam speed

1089
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
This thing

1090
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
OK

1091
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Then

1092
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We have this mode

1093
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
ABC

1094
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What about this mode ABC

1095
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We are not going to turn ABC now

1096
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We are going to turn

1097
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The difference between AB and AC

1098
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OK

1099
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So

1100
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If you do this

1101
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Then we can get

1102
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Control beam speed

1103
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Then we stack it up

1104
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Use that logic to put it

1105
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We use that

1106
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Just stack it up

1107
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We will get

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We want this

1109
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The final result

1110
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This is our swap task

1111
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That

1112
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This experiment system

1113
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That is to say

1114
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The gate time we need in total is

1115
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
1.2 milliseconds

1116
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Then we have this

1117
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's 10 to 20

1118
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That is to say

1119
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Theoretically, we can operate

1120
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
10 to 20

1121
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
After the gate

1122
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It will only

1123
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
There are all kinds of problems

1124
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But in fact

1125
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I can't do it for so long

1126
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The reason is because

1127
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Ah

1128
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Our state preparation

1129
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That is, when we are preparing

1130
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Those vibrations

1131
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There will be a lot of

1132
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Error

1133
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How to say

1134
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That is to say

1135
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We are now

1136
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We are now in this 0

1137
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
0 and 0

1138
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Come to this

1139
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
When this stacks up

1140
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
This overlap

1141
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It is 80% of this

1142
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Overlap, that's right

1143
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But if you take 5 and 5 today

1144
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
If you do the overlap

1145
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Its overlap rate is about 50%

1146
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The main reason

1147
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It says here that

1148
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
There is a possibility that our

1149
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
This state

1150
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This preparation

1151
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's hard to do well

1152
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Of course, one reason is because

1153
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
As your time goes up

1154
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Just follow your

1155
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
When this phonon mode increases

1156
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
His

1157
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Ah

1158
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The coherence time will be shorter

1159
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Then his heating rate

1160
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
May be bigger

1161
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That is to say

1162
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
As your mode

1163
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
When going up

1164
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
He has all kinds of imperfections

1165
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So even if your

1166
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Even if your coherence time is long enough

1167
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Coherence time is not now

1168
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The bottleneck of this experiment is right

1169
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
OK

1170
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So that means we are now

1171
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Overlap 0 and 0

1172
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Great, he saw his 80%

1173
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then 1 and 1 overlap

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
2 and 2 overlap

1175
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
3 and 3 overlap

1176
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
4 and 4, 5 and 5 overlap

1177
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
No problem

1178
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But you want to say

1179
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Overlap 0 and 0 and 1 and 1

1180
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This thing

1181
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It doesn't seem to be very quantum

1182
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Can you overlap 0 plus 1

1183
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Or 0 minus 1

1184
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This thing

1185
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The answer is of course

1186
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So our practical approach is

1187
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We have a 0 plus 1

1188
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Then fix it

1189
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Then we prepare another state

1190
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
He can run from 0 minus 1 to 0 plus 1

1191
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Along the

1192
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Along the

1193
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Along the

1194
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Along the

1195
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Along the

1196
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Just follow that 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1, 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1

1197
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Run around

1198
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But what about the situation

1199
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's find this overlap

1200
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It will become very overlap

1201
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Then it becomes very non-overlap

1202
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Then it becomes very overlap

1203
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Then it becomes non-overlap

1204
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So this thing is what we see

1205
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We can

1206
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
We can not only fold

1207
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This

1208
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We can fold

1209
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So we can now put a

1210
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Fold it up

1211
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But you can't fold a simple one

1212
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He also wants to say

1213
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Then we can fold different things

1214
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Of course we can

1215
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We can not

1216
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We are now preparing a coherent state here

1217
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Then we will

1218
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We just sweep it like a radar

1219
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Sweep a circle

1220
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Sweep a circle

1221
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Sweep a circle

1222
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It means that you can imagine

1223
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This one

1224
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Like a

1225
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Like a plane

1226
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Or a submarine

1227
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Then we sweep it like a sonar

1228
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Sweep a circle

1229
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So this sonar picture

1230
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So this sonar picture

1231
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The result is

1232
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Its overlap

1233
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
One circle one circle

1234
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We will see

1235
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Basically your coherent state

1236
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's really here

1237
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Just this

1238
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
There is no problem with this sonar

1239
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yes

1240
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Then at the same time

1241
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If you put this circle in the middle

1242
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Is

1243
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The length is root number 3

1244
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Take out this circle

1245
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If you take out the slices

1246
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You will find

1247
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It overlaps

1248
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's actually not bad

1249
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It overlaps here

1250
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In fact, there are still 80%

1251
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
About 70-80%

1252
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So this is

1253
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We can really see this

1254
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Overlap two coherent states

1255
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This is two

1256
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Two coherent states

1257
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's not bad

1258
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But I want to say

1259
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Can we do more

1260
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The answer is actually yes

1261
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That is, we are now preparing

1262
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Squeeze state

1263
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That is

1264
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This is also in the coherent state

1265
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
A state that is common

1266
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We can put it

1267
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This

1268
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It

1269
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You can imagine

1270
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
We

1271
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
When we go up along R

1272
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It this

1273
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Its squeeze state

1274
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Will become narrower and narrower

1275
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It will be squeezed more and more

1276
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It will be squeezed more and more

1277
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Like a

1278
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's getting more and more elliptical

1279
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So it's at the bottom

1280
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
When this circle

1281
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's very close to the circle

1282
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That two circles

1283
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If the center of the circle is overlapping

1284
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And then you turn it

1285
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's basically a complete overlap

1286
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You see here

1287
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's close to 1, that's right

1288
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But as you do it now

1289
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
It's getting more and more elliptical

1290
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You let the two elliptical

1291
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
When the core is overlapping

1292
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It finally becomes more and more like

1293
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It's just

1294
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's just

1295
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
When overlapping

1296
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It just turned to the right position

1297
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It overlaps

1298
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
In the middle of this place

1299
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Other places

1300
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Other places you will see

1301
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's basically black

1302
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So we can be sure

1303
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We can overlap this

1304
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
0 plus 1, 0 minus 1

1305
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And overlap all kinds of Fox

1306
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We can overlap

1307
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Squeeze and overlap

1308
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This Cohedron

1309
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
it is good

1310
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So this is physically

1311
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We solved this

1312
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We successfully obtained

1313
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Control

1314
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Binslip gate

1315
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Can get a control swap

1316
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Get these interesting things

1317
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's us

1318
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
This is my paper

1319
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The content is that

1320
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We can actually do this

1321
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That

1322
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Of course you want to say

1323
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That this thing sounds like

1324
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There seems to be no quantum calculation

1325
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Or what quantum calculation

1326
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's just more physical

1327
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The practical way is to say

1328
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
If you can overlap

1329
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
If you have two quantum

1330
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You can

1331
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You can think of two quantum

1332
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's two

1333
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Two quantities

1334
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Because we all know that quantum

1335
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's 0

1336
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Quantum plus one

1337
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Quantum minus two

1338
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Quantum

1339
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This plus one third

1340
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
A three-quantum or so

1341
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So

1342
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The next step is to say

1343
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Can you make it

1344
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It becomes like two quantities

1345
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
To overlap

1346
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Overlap two quantities

1347
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This thing is

1348
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This one

1349
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We all know that linear times

1350
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Overlap two quantities

1351
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
The whole computer science

1352
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Is also the beginning of machine learning

1353
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So we

1354
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So our next experiment is

1355
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
We go through

1356
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This one

1357
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We go through

1358
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
This control bin

1359
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
With some other

1360
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
More skills

1361
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
We started to want to do some

1362
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Things about quantum mechanics

1363
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But today

1364
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I stopped at

1365
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Control swap gate

1366
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It is indeed possible

1367
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Overlap two unknown quantum states

1368
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And its complexity

1369
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The complexity of its own experiment

1370
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It won't follow

1371
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You have to prepare

1372
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It will rise

1373
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, that's about it

1374
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah

1375
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
OK, so that's about it

1376
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Uh

1377
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
OK, that's it

1378
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Let's see what the problem is

1379
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Because I know I'm talking

1380
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
More

1381
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It will be faster

1382
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Because I think

1383
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Uh

1384
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Just cover the whole

1385
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
More general background part

1386
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And then cover

1387
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
For example, the part that is more theoretical

1388
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And then at the end

1389
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It really belongs to us

1390
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This part of the experiment

1391
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So the overall content

1392
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
May be more

1393
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So if you are interested in any part

1394
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You can ask me directly

1395
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Thank you all

1396
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Thank you, Kewei

1397
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
OK

1398
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1399
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We can just pull it back

1400
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Let's see what the problem is

1401
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That is

1402
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The front is actually not too special

1403
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Just some

1404
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Background part

1405
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Because I think

1406
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Maybe some people

1407
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Not doing quantum manipulation

1408
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Just take it all out

1409
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
OK

1410
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah

1411
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So this is very physical

1412
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There is basically nothing here

1413
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Part of the quantum information

1414
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Because that's another one

1415
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Right

1416
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I want to ask a question myself

1417
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Just

1418
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That one

1419
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I actually haven't studied this

1420
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Continuous

1421
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What is it called?

1422
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Continuous variable

1423
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Continuous variable

1424
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yes yes

1425
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This thing with

1426
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Just the general

1427
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That kind of quantum gate

1428
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Is there anything different?

1429
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And they can

1430
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Do the same thing

1431
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Or

1432
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Can you explain a little

1433
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Just

1434
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Ok

1435
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That is to say

1436
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We know this

1437
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Dimensional

1438
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That is to say

1439
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
If you enter this quantum computer

1440
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
He can do

1441
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Just

1442
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Do you have a way to use

1443
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We all know that

1444
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Uh

1445
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Two-dimensional system can do anything

1446
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Quantum

1447
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Uh

1448
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
In your two-dimensional system

1449
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You only need single qubit rotation

1450
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
With ckn

1451
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You can do any quantum calculation

1452
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Is this thing

1453
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Continuous variable

1454
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That is to say

1455
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You are today

1456
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For example

1457
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Can he do this thing

1458
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Is

1459
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The fifth point here

1460
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
This

1461
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
This

1462
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
This

1463
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
He proved

1464
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You only need

1465
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You

1466
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You need these things above

1467
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
With one

1468
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
X and P

1469
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Separate

1470
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
He

1471
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You need a bigger than X

1472
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Square or P square

1473
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
This type

1474
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You can do

1475
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Any of this

1476
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You can simulate any of this

1477
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Uh

1478
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Hamiltonian

1479
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You can do any quantum calculation

1480
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That is to say

1481
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What is continuous variable

1482
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That is to say

1483
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Uh

1484
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You can think of continuous variable

1485
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Is

1486
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Light

1487
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
In the phase space

1488
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
X and P

1489
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That is

1490
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's what I mentioned later

1491
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This

1492
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This is here

1493
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
He is an X and P

1494
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Then why is he a continuous variable

1495
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because you can put this quantum

1496
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Put it in this

1497
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Anywhere in the space

1498
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That is

1499
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Uh

1500
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can put this thing in the space

1501
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Anywhere

1502
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
He is a continuous variable

1503
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You can prepare this vibration today

1504
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
To this side

1505
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This side

1506
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This side

1507
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
This side

1508
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He is here

1509
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But you can also think of it

1510
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
This space

1511
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He is

1512
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Uh

1513
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
These vibrations

1514
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Or these coherent states

1515
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It can become

1516
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Zero phonon

1517
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
One phonon

1518
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Two phonons

1519
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Three phonons

1520
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So these two symbols are equal

1521
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You can express it as

1522
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The distribution inside the phase space

1523
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You can also express it as

1524
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
He is a variety of phonons

1525
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Superposition of phonons

1526
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
These two are equal

1527
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Oh

1528
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Comparison value

1529
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
In fact, it is the quantum optics

1530
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Put the photon into the phonon

1531
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That's right

1532
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes, that's right

1533
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's two

1534
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The mathematical structure is exactly the same

1535
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Just quantum optics

1536
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
People will love to say

1537
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
X and P

1538
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But like this

1539
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But people who do quantum mechanics

1540
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Say we see one

1541
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
One by one

1542
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That is

1543
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So we like to say

1544
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Infinite dimension

1545
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So

1546
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This page

1547
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I think the point is

1548
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Uh

1549
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Wait a minute

1550
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Here

1551
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So here

1552
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I will say

1553
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It is continuous

1554
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Variable quantum information

1555
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
But you look at the picture

1556
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's actually not continuous

1557
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's obvious in the picture

1558
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It is

1559
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's infinite dimension

1560
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's right

1561
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So these two are equal

1562
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Just

1563
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Because the tool is different from the system

1564
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So the language used is not the same

1565
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yes

1566
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So continuous variable

1567
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
This word must have appeared earlier

1568
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Because quantum mechanics

1569
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Maybe there was in the 1980s

1570
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But infinite dimension

1571
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So we do quantum mechanics

1572
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Will use

1573
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Because it is

1574
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
More fancy

1575
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Theoretically, the vibration of infinite dimension

1576
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because

1577
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It's like your x and p in theory

1578
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Like a vacuum

1579
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Can be pulled to infinity

1580
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
In practice, of course, it can't be pulled that far

1581
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But it is theoretically infinite

1582
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
OK

1583
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
understand

1584
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yes

1585
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Then

1586
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Sorry

1587
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
OK

1588
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I understand now

1589
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What I want to do

1590
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But I want to understand again

1591
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That

1592
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That

1593
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
What is this

1594
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Con

1595
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
What is this

1596
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Control beam

1597
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Control beam splitter

1598
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yes

1599
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That is to say

1600
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
When you just said

1601
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Our

1602
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
OK

1603
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Our purpose is simple

1604
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That is to say

1605
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Our purpose is to get control beam splitter

1606
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But our physical system

1607
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Can you give us control beam splitter directly

1608
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It can't give us control beam splitter directly

1609
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It also gives us a very close

1610
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Control beam splitter

1611
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It can give us

1612
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That is to say

1613
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh

1614
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But one point is that

1615
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
The picture we drew here is in z-basis

1616
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That is

1617
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
G and E

1618
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But we can get it in practice

1619
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Is in x-basis

1620
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But this is a small detail in practice

1621
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We ignore it first

1622
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That is to say

1623
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Here is x-basis

1624
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But the point is

1625
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
After you get this Hamiltonian today

1626
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You throw it down

1627
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The result of it running is

1628
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In addition to being able to swap

1629
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It will get a

1630
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
In the process of swapping

1631
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Like

1632
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Why do you say that

1633
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You imagine

1634
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You see your light

1635
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
After the reflection on the glass

1636
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's beam splitter

1637
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
After the reflection on the glass

1638
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It will get a fragrance

1639
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You put a light on the glass today

1640
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It will get a fragrance

1641
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So this thing is completely reasonable

1642
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That is to say

1643
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because

1644
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
This Hamiltonian

1645
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
In fact, it is the Hamiltonian of beam splitter

1646
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It will naturally get the feature of beam splitter

1647
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That is to say

1648
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You hit this

1649
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You hit this

1650
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
On the beam splitter

1651
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It will get a fragrance

1652
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
We have to kill this fragrance

1653
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Otherwise

1654
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
We can't get this

1655
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Swap gate

1656
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's right

1657
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So we kill this fragrance

1658
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The approach is

1659
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Let's put things in B first

1660
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Then B and C do something first

1661
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Then put

1662
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
B and A do an action first

1663
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Let A and C do an action

1664
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We can wait

1665
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Kill it

1666
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
As for why this thing

1667
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It will be like this

1668
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Anyway

1669
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This thing is

1670
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
In 2020

1671
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's been a long time since someone discovered this thing in math

1672
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I want to ask

1673
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
How is it done physically?

1674
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That is physically

1675
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Why

1676
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Beam splitter gate

1677
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You mean

1678
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Why this

1679
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Or why

1680
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You use two lasers

1681
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
After hitting

1682
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Why is it

1683
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Will be a very similar

1684
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Very similar to swap gate

1685
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
What I'm asking is the experiment

1686
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OK

1687
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Why in practice

1688
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
In fact, the obvious reason is because

1689
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Can you go to the next page

1690
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
OK

1691
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Is it in this page?

1692
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yes

1693
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That is

1694
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's pretty obvious

1695
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That is to say

1696
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
If you know what is blue sideband and red sideband

1697
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Blue sideband

1698
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Hit it

1699
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It's sigma plus and A

1700
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You know this

1701
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That is

1702
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That is

1703
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Let me see if I can draw it here

1704
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I should be able to draw a picture

1705
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Let me see

1706
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
OK

1707
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So

1708
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If we are in this today

1709
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This thing

1710
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We

1711
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
If you just hit one

1712
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It will become sigma plus

1713
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And

1714
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
A

1715
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
OK

1716
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That is to say

1717
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So if we are now

1718
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
OK

1719
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Then add cc

1720
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Anyway, I don't draw cc

1721
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That

1722
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You want to say

1723
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Can we reach a higher level

1724
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Is the second order sideband

1725
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That is

1726
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We know we can do sigma plus A

1727
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Sigma plus B

1728
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Sigma plus C

1729
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But if we do it today

1730
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Sigma plus

1731
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
A

1732
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
B plus

1733
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Then we add

1734
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Sigma

1735
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Minus

1736
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
A

1737
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
B

1738
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Plus

1739
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Then add cc

1740
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Just add that complex conjugate

1741
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Ignore it

1742
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That is

1743
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Then there is cc

1744
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
In this case

1745
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
When you combine these two items

1746
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Sigma plus plus sigma minus is sigma x

1747
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So it will automatically become

1748
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Sigma x

1749
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
A plus B

1750
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That is

1751
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
You drive two second-order sidebands

1752
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It will become

1753
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Control beam speaker

1754
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That is

1755
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That is to say

1756
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Because

1757
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
We know that in terms of food

1758
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You are going through this

1759
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That is

1760
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You are you are

1761
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
When you expand that

1762
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Lanadaiki parameter

1763
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Can allow all kinds of

1764
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
All kinds of interactions

1765
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You don't just open carrier

1766
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Just

1767
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's not just a sideband

1768
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You can go all the way up

1769
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Right

1770
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Which day is this thing

1771
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Paper

1772
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It is

1773
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
This is it

1774
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I think this is still

1775
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Oh that's it

1776
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
This one

1777
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This is the theoretical basis of the experiment

1778
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It should be said that it is the experimental

1779
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Toolbox

1780
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I think the theoretical basis is how to say

1781
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
What is the theoretical basis of the experiment

1782
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The theoretical basis of the experiment is

1783
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You can say that the theoretical basis

1784
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The point is this

1785
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
That is to say we

1786
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
If we want to measure

1787
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
If this is the case

1788
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
That's 2001

1789
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Some people say

1790
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Hey

1791
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
In theory, if you have this gate

1792
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
We can do this

1793
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Then this is great

1794
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Correct

1795
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Then we can do this

1796
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Right

1797
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That

1798
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
The reason why this thing is done

1799
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I

1800
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I think the reason why this thing is done

1801
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It can be said that the one just now is right

1802
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But

1803
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Oh

1804
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
This one

1805
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
This should be 2017

1806
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
2016

1807
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Right

1808
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
But the problem is coming

1809
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You get it through that one

1810
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's called control

1811
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It's called control

1812
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's called control

1813
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
How to integrate

1814
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's called control

1815
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It's called control

1816
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's called control

1817
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's called control

1818
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
This one

1819
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
2001

1820
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Or in 2002

1821
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
2001

1822
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It is said that someone

1823
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
In theory

1824
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Do this thing

1825
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But in practice

1826
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
By 2016

1827
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
17 years

1828
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Just come out

1829
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
This is what it is

1830
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Right

1831
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Really

1832
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So

1833
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It is how to integrate

1834
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,000


1835
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This is reasonably early

1836
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Someone picked it up

1837
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Of course

1838
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't know where it is

1839
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I didn't find out until I found this

1840
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Otherwise

1841
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Then I thought

1842
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Because

1843
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Our time is

1844
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Paper of 2018

1845
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Is to do control

1846
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But then I thought

1847
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
How to do the next step

1848
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I don't want to say

1849
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
We should do cswap

1850
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But how to do

1851
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I don't know

1852
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Because I want to say

1853
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
That waste time

1854
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Can't be eliminated

1855
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Then I thought

1856
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Someone said he already thought

1857
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
How to eliminate

1858
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That is to do it on the experiment

1859
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Then write a model

1860
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It proves that it works

1861
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Then do it

1862
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Right

1863
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It is a

1864
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Quite a lot

1865
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Background process

1866
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
That's right

1867
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So

1868
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It's just that you simply say

1869
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
How to do control

1870
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Hit two lasers

1871
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The frequency difference between it

1872
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
490 respectively

1873
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
380 or 490 respectively

1874
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It will become a

1875
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Control

1876
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Control

1877
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But

1878
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
why

1879
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Two

1880
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Control

1881
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Combine

1882
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Can become a cswap

1883
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
This thing

1884
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It's not that obvious

1885
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Right

1886
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Need a little math

1887
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Right

1888
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Right

1889
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Then

1890
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Let's

1891
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Right

1892
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Right

1893
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
The omega ab

1894
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Is

1895
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Above

1896
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Omega b

1897
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Omega c

1898
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Omega a

1899
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Right

1900
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Right

1901
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Then omega

1902
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
ac

1903
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Omega c

1904
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Omega a

1905
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Right

1906
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That's right

1907
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I want to ask

1908
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Just like

1909
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We look at this

1910
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Mode

1911
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
abc

1912
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Obviously

1913
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
b and c

1914
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Feel like

1915
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Orthogonal

1916
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But

1917
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Your side

1918
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
a and b

1919
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
a and c

1920
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Is it orthogonal to each other?

1921
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
These are all normal mode

1922
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
All normal mode

1923
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
He is

1924
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Orthogonal

1925
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
One

1926
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Orthogonal

1927
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
OK

1928
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Because normal mode

1929
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's you

1930
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You solve it

1931
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Between them

1932
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
There is no linear

1933
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Dependent relationship

1934
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Right

1935
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Understand

1936
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Then you said before

1937
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You choose

1938
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
ab

1939
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
With ac

1940
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
The two

1941
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Interaction

1942
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Hey

1943
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
What is it

1944
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Special reasons

1945
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Like

1946
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
In

1947
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
You are in the front page

1948
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
The first slide

1949
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
There

1950
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You can choose

1951
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
a b a c

1952
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Right

1953
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You ask

1954
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
OK

1955
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This is the reason for choosing

1956
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That is to say

1957
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Mode c is coherent

1958
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
We look

1959
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Let's look at it from this page

1960
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That is to say

1961
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You will find mode a and mode b

1962
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Is a

1963
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's all face

1964
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The two of them

1965
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Vibration direction is opposite

1966
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That is

1967
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You will find

1968
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Although they are both

1969
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
One vibrates in the y-direction

1970
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
One vibrates in the x-direction

1971
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
They are both anti-vibration

1972
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Only mode c is the same vibration

1973
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What will happen

1974
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
The problem is

1975
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
The coherence time of mode c

1976
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Is the shortest

1977
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The shortest

1978
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Because you vibrate in the same direction

1979
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Easy to get noise

1980
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
With all kinds of strange effects

1981
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So the coherence time of mode c

1982
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The shortest

1983
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So compare it

1984
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We have to

1985
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Let a and b interact first

1986
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Then let

1987
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Then let c come up at the end

1988
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
This is what we found

1989
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This kind of performance is better

1990
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That is

1991
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
A mode and b mode

1992
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Is a better mode

1993
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So we let it do

1994
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
After the thing

1995
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Then let c come up at the end

1996
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Right

1997
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
This is

1998
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Why

1999
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Because he

2000
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
He

2001
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
He

2002
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
He

2003
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
He

2004
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Because he

2005
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
These modes

2006
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The

2007
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Coherence time

2008
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Is determined by what

2009
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Not the same

2010
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He

2011
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
A big part

2012
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
A big part

2013
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Is either out of phase

2014
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Or in-phase

2015
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Is

2016
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Tonight

2017
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The

2018
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,500
Vibration

2019
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,000
K2 rotation

2020
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Is a vertical vibration

2021
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
K2 rotation

2022
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Is an inront vibration

2023
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Now this mode c

2024
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Is an index vibration

2025
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's so vibrant

2026
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Is

2027
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
When this particle

2028
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Moves to this side

2029
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
This one would move there

2030
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But if we use mode b and mode a

2031
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So

2032
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Compared to

2033
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
If you have a noise outside

2034
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
When it comes

2035
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
A and b basically

2036
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Will not be affected

2037
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But c will be affected

2038
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So c coherence time

2039
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The shortest

2040
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This is why we

2041
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Of course there is a d

2042
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But we later chose

2043
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Just choose to use a b c

2044
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Just ignore it

2045
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
We use a b and a c

2046
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
To do this action

2047
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So

2048
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So we

2049
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You say sorry first

2050
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We are in our time

2051
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That is to say

2052
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Our a

2053
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
b this

2054
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Bitter

2055
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
The particle is better than a c

2056
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Because a and b are all good modes

2057
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
a c has a mode

2058
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So

2059
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It's better

2060
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That's right

2061
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Assuming another d

2062
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's a bit like

2063
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Mode a

2064
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
But it's the same vibration

2065
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Yes that's right

2066
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's it

2067
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
OK OK

2068
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Then that one

2069
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
The coherence is also very bad

2070
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's not good

2071
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The reason it's worse

2072
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's the same as what you just explained

2073
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yes

2074
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So it's the same

2075
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It's the same

2076
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Understand

2077
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's the same

2078
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
If it is in phase vibration

2079
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's easier to pick up all kinds of noise

2080
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Then it's easy to pick up noise

2081
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Because

2082
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's hard for us to find a source

2083
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Is

2084
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
In such a small space

2085
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It actually kicked in two directions

2086
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So you assume

2087
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You suddenly have a burst coming today

2088
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Or you have one today

2089
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Your this

2090
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Your this

2091
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
If source has a noise

2092
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
When it comes

2093
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It

2094
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Maybe

2095
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Oh

2096
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Understand

2097
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's just

2098
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's just

2099
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It has a negative effect on mode c

2100
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But it doesn't affect a and b

2101
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Basically

2102
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because a and b are opposite

2103
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's impossible to be in this direction

2104
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Give you two opposite kicks

2105
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's not possible

2106
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's not possible

2107
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So

2108
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So

2109
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
This noise source

2110
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's with his special

2111
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Because he's in

2112
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
His mode

2113
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
This one

2114
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Is it related

2115
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Is

2116
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Because of his

2117
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
On the space

2118
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Really in position

2119
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And really

2120
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Cause his

2121
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is the source of this noise

2122
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You can think of it as

2123
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
He is today

2124
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
He is in

2125
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Uh

2126
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
He's in

2127
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He's like a swing

2128
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Such a positive direction

2129
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And then if you have one today

2130
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
If the wave of Sinusoid comes

2131
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It will be kicked

2132
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It will be accelerated or decelerated

2133
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
But

2134
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
If you compare today

2135
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You suddenly have a Sinusoid in your space

2136
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
This one

2137
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
EM wave

2138
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
But it doesn't affect mode a and mode b

2139
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because

2140
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
He can't drive him

2141
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He can't

2142
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
He can't

2143
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
He can't increase his phonon

2144
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah yeah yeah

2145
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Really

2146
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
OK

2147
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh

2148
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
His energy won't be like this

2149
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
OK

2150
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh

2151
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So interesting

2152
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh

2153
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah

2154
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This is

2155
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
This is the details of the experiment

2156
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's in this place

2157
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That's right

2158
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Why do we

2159
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Don't choose ABC

2160
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Because this is the best choice

2161
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Yeah

2162
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah

2163
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I can ask a little bit

2164
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That's what you didn't mention

2165
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That's the readout part

2166
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Is there

2167
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
OK

2168
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Our readout part is

2169
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Uh

2170
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Our

2171
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
The real readout in the experiment

2172
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Is that we actually

2173
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's just a spin

2174
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You see here

2175
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
The readout is only on this side

2176
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
We can do it

2177
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
We

2178
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
We can do it

2179
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This

2180
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Readout b and c

2181
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
but

2182
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Our

2183
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
The selling point of this experiment is that

2184
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
We are constant dips

2185
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Then we don't need

2186
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Measure b and c

2187
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But in fact

2188
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If you really prepared a state

2189
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
How do you measure it

2190
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You go

2191
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You just go straight to drive

2192
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
This

2193
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Read the sideband

2194
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Then look at his fit

2195
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Just

2196
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You just go straight to drive

2197
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
His sideband

2198
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Then look at him

2199
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
0, 1, 2, 3

2200
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
This thing can be done directly

2201
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But we don't want to do this either

2202
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We just want to go straight

2203
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Look at the spin

2204
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You can see how similar b and c are

2205
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
This is the goal of our experiment

2206
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
In fact

2207
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
In fact, here

2208
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Say this

2209
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Measurement

2210
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That is to say

2211
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's very standard

2212
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Uh

2213
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
This is the same as the general

2214
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's the same as the general

2215
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Just

2216
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Just use this

2217
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
State detection

2218
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Then

2219
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You can use the sideband to see how much he has

2220
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Phonon in

2221
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
In

2222
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
In each number ratio

2223
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Right

2224
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Um

2225
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Understand

2226
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh, there's another one

2227
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I just mentioned this

2228
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So

2229
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I said this is 1.2 seconds, right?

2230
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But

2231
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
If you find out

2232
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You'll find this

2233
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
The first one here is how long his gay time is

2234
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
His whole paten's gay time

2235
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
The paten here is his

2236
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
His paten is only half paten

2237
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But his face is different

2238
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Let's ignore the face now

2239
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Don't look

2240
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You'll find that he's longer here

2241
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It's shorter here

2242
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Because we know this

2243
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
A and B are all good

2244
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So A and B

2245
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It takes a longer time

2246
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He's less likely to happen

2247
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There's a problem with A and C

2248
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So he

2249
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
We only gave him half the time

2250
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That is

2251
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
We know we have to

2252
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
One control

2253
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Is running full paten

2254
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
The other one is running half paten

2255
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Then we put

2256
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
The better one is running full paten

2257
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So this part here

2258
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It takes 0.8 milliseconds

2259
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
This is 0.4

2260
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So 0.8

2261
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Divided by 0.4

2262
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
0.8 plus 0.4

2263
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So 0.8 is here

2264
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
This is the number

2265
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That's right

2266
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Does anyone else have any questions?

2267
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I think

2268
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Like you

2269
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Sorry

2270
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Ted, please ask

2271
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Sorry

2272
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I have a lot of questions

2273
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This

2274
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
This

2275
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You

2276
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'm just going to ask this picture

2277
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You just stopped here

2278
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
He

2279
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Stay here

2280
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
His this

2281
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
M12345

2282
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
His this

2283
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You

2284
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You have a picture later

2285
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
He is

2286
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Is he a coherent state?

2287
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
In Fonin's

2288
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Spectrum

2289
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
He's a coherent state

2290
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
This

2291
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Here we are

2292
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Prepare

2293
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Fog

2294
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Fog

2295
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Then let it overlap

2296
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But because of our

2297
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Fog

2298
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I can't prepare well

2299
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
In a very high Fonin

2300
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So

2301
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The difference in performance here

2302
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's not our

2303
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Control

2304
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
The difference in performance

2305
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's because we can't

2306
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
A very good one

2307
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Fog

2308
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Five

2309
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
The state is right

2310
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
OK

2311
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So he's not a state preparation

2312
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The problem

2313
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He is

2314
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
He is

2315
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
He is

2316
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The problem

2317
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I see

2318
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We did it later

2319
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
We did all kinds of simulations

2320
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What does it include

2321
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
We found

2322
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
In

2323
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
When n is equal to 5

2324
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
If the state preparation is perfect

2325
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Plus all kinds of noise

2326
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
With all kinds of problems

2327
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
His Fog

2328
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It should be 90%

2329
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Even if n is equal to 5

2330
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But we see here

2331
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In fact, his Fog

2332
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's about 50%

2333
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The middle

2334
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Most of the problems are in

2335
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
State preparation

2336
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That's right

2337
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I see

2338
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Thank you

2339
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
This is where you can do

2340
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Overlap

2341
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And then this is where you can do

2342
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
This

2343
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Coherent state

2344
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's right

2345
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I think the radar map is still

2346
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It looks pretty interesting

2347
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
This radar map

2348
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
It's actually a circle

2349
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That's what we

2350
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Every experiment is to draw a circle

2351
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And then draw it

2352
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
The place of the circle

2353
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
In

2354
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It's a beautiful radar map

2355
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And then he

2356
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That's it

2357
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Here

2358
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And then

2359
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You'll always see

2360
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
There's a

2361
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's not a beautiful place

2362
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
This is what we found

2363
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
That's right

2364
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
You think you only drive

2365
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
One direction

2366
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Coherent state

2367
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's not

2368
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
The experiment is not so perfect

2369
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
He's going in the opposite direction

2370
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
A little bit of stuff

2371
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That's right

2372
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So here's a little bit

2373
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
It looks like that

2374
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
The dirty stuff is here

2375
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That's

2376
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That's existence

2377
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That's right

2378
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And then here

2379
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
We don't draw radar maps

2380
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Because this thing

2381
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Its

2382
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
The form of expression

2383
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
This is better

2384
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So

2385
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
How did you generate that

2386
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
That's Omega A and Omega B

2387
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Omega AB and Omega

2388
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
AC

2389
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I remember you said

2390
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You use Pulse Laser

2391
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
That's right

2392
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
You

2393
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Pulse Laser, for example, is

2394
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
After a frequency

2395
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
How do we operate it

2396
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
That is, we let it pass through AOM

2397
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
After you pass through AOM

2398
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You can

2399
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You can operate the frequency of AOM

2400
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It will

2401
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It will shift to different places

2402
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's right

2403
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
That is, we use AOM to

2404
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
To control the frequency of the laser

2405
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That is

2406
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The whole laser

2407
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It might be

2408
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
For example, 369.58

2409
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Something like that

2410
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Assuming this number

2411
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Then you want it to become

2412
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
369.58 plus 380kHz

2413
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Then you let your AOM

2414
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Have

2415
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You just let your AOM shift it

2416
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It will

2417
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It will shift away

2418
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
OK

2419
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
In fact, this

2420
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Of course it's a whole

2421
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
A whole laser thing

2422
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But we're talking about it now

2423
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's all

2424
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's all good

2425
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's okay

2426
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
That's right

2427
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Let me confirm it again

2428
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
This thing is

2429
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Your Pulse Laser

2430
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Your Pulse Laser

2431
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
How long is it

2432
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Three hundred

2433
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Three hundred and sixty something

2434
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Three hundred

2435
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Three hundred

2436
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Or 370

2437
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It should be 375 times

2438
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
This number

2439
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm going to check it out

2440
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Because

2441
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I remember more

2442
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's 369

2443
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Because that is

2444
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Static connection will be needed

2445
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
No, no

2446
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That is

2447
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
We

2448
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
What do you think

2449
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
He asked

2450
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
He may

2451
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Jason may be asking you

2452
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
That Pulse Laser

2453
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Pulse Width

2454
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
How much

2455
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes, yes, yes, Pulse Width

2456
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
What is it

2457
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You mean

2458
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh, we're Pico Second

2459
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I forgot how many Pico Seconds

2460
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
OK

2461
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You mean

2462
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You mean time is right

2463
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
OK

2464
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yes, yes, yes

2465
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We're pretty standard

2466
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But I forgot

2467
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I forgot how many Pico Seconds

2468
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I remember his time scale

2469
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's right there

2470
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Uh-huh

2471
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Right

2472
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Uh-huh

2473
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Right

2474
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Uh-huh

2475
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I don't really understand this

2476
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You are a

2477
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You are a

2478
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Pico Second Laser

2479
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Pico Second Laser

2480
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Then its bandwidth

2481
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Then its bandwidth

2482
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
There may be

2483
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
About one nanometer

2484
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
About one nanometer

2485
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But your

2486
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But your

2487
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
OK

2488
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But your

2489
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But your

2490
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Atomic Transition

2491
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Isn't it all

2492
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Atomic Transition

2493
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
We are

2494
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
We are

2495
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
We are

2496
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But we are

2497
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Because

2498
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
This is the feature of Frequency Com

2499
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Frequency Com means

2500
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You have today

2501
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
You have today

2502
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Uh, wait a minute

2503
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I'll take a pen

2504
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'll take a pen

2505
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Frequency Com features

2506
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You're here today

2507
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And then you have a middle

2508
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And then you have a middle

2509
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But because you're running out of time

2510
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But because you're running out of time

2511
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
A bunch of

2512
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
A bunch of

2513
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Right

2514
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
But

2515
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But

2516
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
The advantage of this experiment is

2517
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
The advantage of this experiment is

2518
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You don't have to care

2519
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Because you use another

2520
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Because you use another

2521
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You split this laser

2522
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So it's

2523
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Because it is

2524
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So you share it

2525
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Because it is

2526
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
He's gon na grow up like this

2527
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Because it is

2528
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Frequency Com

2529
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Then two Frequency Com

2530
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Then two Frequency Com

2531
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
For example, if I lost one

2532
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And this one is

2533
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Then this one is

2534
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Then this one

2535
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
You can risk it

2536
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So

2537
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
The point is that

2538
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Although it is a pile of

2539
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But the point is

2540
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But the point is

2541
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
His

2542
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
His relative

2543
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Whether it's fixed

2544
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side

2545
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side

2546
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's the

2547
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
His

2548
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
His

2549
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
The point is that

2550
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Your

2551
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Your

2552
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
AOM

2553
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Shift it to the point

2554
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Is it because

2555
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because it is

2556
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Equal spacing

2557
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That is to say, the middle of it is

2558
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Equal spacing

2559
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
You just let the first one

2560
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
For example, with

2561
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
We actually let the first one

2562
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
With the 166th

2563
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Will

2564
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Resonance

2565
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
OK

2566
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That is

2567
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yes, we actually do it

2568
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
166 is right

2569
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But in fact, you think

2570
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The tenth one should be fine

2571
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But we choose the 166th

2572
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So

2573
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
In fact, this one

2574
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Will be with a very far

2575
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Here

2576
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So this one

2577
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Will be with the first

2578
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
For example, 165

2579
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Resonance

2580
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But

2581
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Because they are from the same laser

2582
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So

2583
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
If this frequency

2584
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
When the left shift

2585
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
The one below will be left shift

2586
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It doesn't matter

2587
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
As long as they are relative

2588
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Just lock it

2589
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
They

2590
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It doesn't matter if it shifts

2591
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That's right

2592
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
His

2593
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
His

2594
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
His absolute shift

2595
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It doesn't matter

2596
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So why do you hear me

2597
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I don't seem to remember

2598
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
His absolute wavelength

2599
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
His absolute wavelength is about the same

2600
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
The result you came out today is

2601
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Your central frequency today

2602
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Is 369

2603
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Or 369.5

2604
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
369.5

2605
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Anyway, what he came out of

2606
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Is stable

2607
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Then

2608
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Our focus is on whether I can

2609
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
His ALM

2610
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
His two

2611
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Relative is not stable

2612
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
This is more important

2613
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Understand

2614
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
OK

2615
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
OK

2616
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
If you don't have any questions for the time being

2617
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Thank you first

2618
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Then I will finish this video first
