00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to share my screen first.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
You can share your screen at the same time, no problem.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay, cool.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Thank you.

00:11.000 --> 00:23.000
We are really happy to have Yichi as our speaker today.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Yichi Hong is currently a second-year PhD student at Boston University.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Coincidentally, she studied psychology at Taiwan University.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
She studied psychology at Taiwan University.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
She has worked in two different research institutes.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
One is a research institute run by Dr. Reagan Lin.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
The other is a research institute run by Dr. Wu Wen-Chi.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
She mainly studies behavioral coding and research methods related to FMRI.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Yichi is amazing.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
She graduated three years in advance.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
After graduation, she became a research assistant for two years.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Now, she has applied to Boston University for research.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Her research focuses on the characteristics of adult anti-social behavior that can be observed in childhood.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
She studies these characteristics through the method of quantitative behavior inheritance.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Today, we will hear some research related to FMRI, behavioral inheritance, and so on.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I will introduce Yichi to you.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Let's give Yichi the floor.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Welcome, Yichi.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Please start.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Behavioral inheritance is a difficult topic.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
I will not talk about the research related to FMRI today.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I will start.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I am Yichi Hong.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I am a postgraduate student at Boston University.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
My research focuses on the development of children before puberty.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
We can estimate the impact of genes and the environment on behavior.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
In a group, we can see the difference in individual behavior.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
How many percentages can be explained by genes or the environment?

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I will talk about behavioral inheritance and how to do it.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
I will talk about the assumption and basic model of FMRI.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I will talk about the changes we have collected and the analysis we are doing.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We did not control or manipulate any of the changes.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
We did not secretly send twins to different families.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
We did not secretly send twins to different families.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
Behavioral inheritance aims to answer a big question in psychology or philosophy.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
The question is whether human behavior is decided by God or God.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Plato and Aristotle had different opinions on this question.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Plato thought that human behavior was decided by God.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Everyone was born with different abilities.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Aristotle thought that human behavior was created by God.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Everyone was born with a white paper.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
The structure of society or education is the most important factor in our behavior.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
We also saw this in the time of Simon.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
We also saw this in the time of Simon.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Testamentarians often prioritized diversity and the experience.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Testamentians felt that human beings should have some talents.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
They felt that human beings should have some talents.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
It's Universalism.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
But what is the current psychology on these issues?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
But what is the current psychology on these issues?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
We have been walking along a middle path quite sufficiently.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
We felt that genes and environment

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
We felt that genes and environment

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
and others are responsible for human behavior.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.880
We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.000
We found that there are other researches on the relationship between environment and genes.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Through personalities in different religions

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
through personalities in different religions

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.040
we studies on to analyze genetic mutations.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.040
Human is a sediment different environment

04:31.080 --> 04:33.200
There are some unfavorable examples that we find on sexual environment,

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
The first thing is family study

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
people in Taiwan has monogamy books

04:36.200 --> 04:38.200
We have now standardized this information

04:38.200 --> 04:40.200
We have now standardized this information

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
we have now standardized this information

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
family study looks like

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
family study looks like

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
Although it is shown by numbers

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

04:50.200 --> 04:52.200
Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

04:52.200 --> 04:54.200
The ratio of genes divided by family is high

04:54.200 --> 04:56.700
Children are more likely to be sexually transmitted

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
the environment of each generation will be different

05:29.040 --> 05:31.040
the environment of each generation will be different

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
The information on different generations, as mentioned before, varies from generation to generation

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
However, DNA definition should only be applied in children

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
However, DNA definition should only be applied in children

05:37.040 --> 05:41.620
The ideal condition is to find тур

05:41.620 --> 05:43.620
The task of double third-party studies is a good source of the teacher

05:43.620 --> 05:45.140
the task of double third-party studies is a good source of the feeder

05:45.140 --> 05:47.140
they are born almost the same time

05:47.140 --> 05:49.140
you can see the picture

05:49.140 --> 05:51.140
They are the same sex

05:51.140 --> 05:53.140
they are the same sex

05:53.140 --> 05:55.140
genes are 100% connected

05:56.040 --> 05:57.920
10% of twins, mother and childω

05:57.920 --> 05:59.920
10% of twins, mother and childω

05:59.920 --> 06:01.920
10% of twins, mother and childω

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
10% of twins, mother and childω

06:03.920 --> 06:05.920
10% of twins, mother and childω

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
they often havesoft egg

06:07.920 --> 06:09.920
they often have soft egg

06:09.920 --> 06:11.920
they can be more close in relationship

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
they can be more close in relationship

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
they can be more close in relationship

06:15.920 --> 06:17.920
when they share the 100%

06:17.920 --> 06:19.860
thus 50%

06:19.860 --> 06:20.060
he can then estimate the influence with document

06:20.060 --> 06:22.060
thus 50%

06:22.060 --> 06:24.060
hence 50%

06:24.060 --> 06:24.920
and the impact will be still small

06:25.600 --> 06:27.360
that is a limitation of the research

06:27.360 --> 06:30.900
even they have good genetic analysis

06:30.900 --> 06:32.260
but it is hard to control the enviornment

06:32.260 --> 06:33.900
then collectively

06:33.900 --> 06:35.300
the research of pig breeding

06:35.300 --> 06:36.700
has better analysis of the envientos

06:36.700 --> 06:38.280
as you can see in this diagram

06:38.280 --> 06:39.780
the research of children breeding

06:39.780 --> 06:41.760
and the parents who breed

06:41.760 --> 06:42.900
the similarities between them

06:42.900 --> 06:43.860
can be explain in Template 0

06:43.860 --> 06:44.860
can be explain in Template 0

06:44.860 --> 06:46.480
they share the enviornment

06:47.140 --> 06:49.180
the relationship between childrens and parents

06:49.180 --> 06:50.580
the relationship between children and parents

06:50.580 --> 06:53.160
that is related with their genes

06:53.760 --> 06:55.280
but the influence of the same generation

06:55.280 --> 06:57.640
can be seen in the design of the research

06:58.520 --> 07:00.560
so the most perfect state

07:00.560 --> 07:03.200
should be when we study the twins who are adopted

07:03.200 --> 07:05.240
but the limitation of the research

07:05.240 --> 07:07.160
is that it is hard to collect such data

07:07.160 --> 07:09.040
the database I know in the world

07:09.040 --> 07:10.120
should be one in Sweden

07:10.120 --> 07:11.200
and one in Minnesota

07:11.200 --> 07:13.360
so the limitation is that it is hard to collect the data

07:14.600 --> 07:17.040
the above is the method of measurement

07:17.040 --> 07:18.800
that is we can't directly see

07:18.800 --> 07:19.880
which DNA

07:19.880 --> 07:21.920
has influence on the behavior

07:22.840 --> 07:24.480
but with the development of biotechnology

07:24.480 --> 07:26.920
we can directly see the information in DNA

07:26.920 --> 07:28.240
but I am not familiar with this

07:28.240 --> 07:29.920
so I will simply divide it into

07:29.920 --> 07:31.920
theoretical and atheoretical

07:31.920 --> 07:33.080
to introduce to you

07:33.080 --> 07:34.360
the former is like

07:34.360 --> 07:36.480
candidate genes

07:36.480 --> 07:37.320
for example

07:37.320 --> 07:39.640
today I want to see the behavior of adulteration

07:39.640 --> 07:40.680
then I will study

07:40.680 --> 07:42.040
the genes related to the多巴胺

07:42.040 --> 07:42.600
because we know that

07:42.600 --> 07:43.960
the rejuvenation mechanism and adulteration

07:43.960 --> 07:45.600
are closely related

07:45.960 --> 07:47.640
so we will first select some genes

07:47.640 --> 07:49.720
then put the focus on these genes

07:49.720 --> 07:51.480
to see the variances of these genes

07:51.480 --> 07:52.960
and the variances of the behavior

07:52.960 --> 07:53.880
are they related

07:54.800 --> 07:56.000
but now this method

07:56.000 --> 07:56.640
is a little bit

07:57.520 --> 07:58.360
unknown

07:58.360 --> 07:59.080
because

07:59.080 --> 07:59.800
human behavior

07:59.800 --> 08:00.600
doesn't look like

08:00.600 --> 08:02.360
there is a small part of genes

08:02.360 --> 08:04.120
and then there is a huge amount of effect

08:04.120 --> 08:05.480
to explain those behaviors

08:05.480 --> 08:06.000
but

08:06.000 --> 08:07.600
more like there are many many genes

08:07.600 --> 08:08.880
and then their effect is very small

08:08.880 --> 08:09.960
and then pile up

08:10.440 --> 08:11.240
so

08:11.240 --> 08:12.880
through the method of candidate genes

08:12.880 --> 08:14.000
we can currently

08:14.000 --> 08:15.440
explain

08:15.440 --> 08:17.480
the behavior variation is about 1% to 5%

08:17.480 --> 08:18.280
that kind of variation

08:18.280 --> 08:19.400
and we use the previous

08:19.440 --> 08:20.160
mentioned

08:20.160 --> 08:22.160
quantitative behavioral genetics

08:22.160 --> 08:23.040
to get the

08:23.040 --> 08:24.160
estimate value

08:24.160 --> 08:25.360
there is a big gap

08:26.240 --> 08:27.240
so later

08:27.240 --> 08:28.200
molecular biologists

08:28.200 --> 08:30.200
or molecular bio-hereditary behaviorists

08:30.200 --> 08:32.000
they use a more violent method

08:32.000 --> 08:33.360
that is not to assume

08:33.360 --> 08:34.520
and then go to GWAS

08:34.520 --> 08:36.640
directly analyze all the DNA sequences

08:36.640 --> 08:38.200
that can see a lot of nucleotides

08:38.200 --> 08:38.720
that is

08:38.720 --> 08:40.120
the ACTG in DNA

08:40.120 --> 08:40.840
these sequences

08:41.480 --> 08:42.760
and then we will go to see

08:43.400 --> 08:44.320
these nucleotides

08:44.800 --> 08:46.440
we will go through their

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
variance

08:48.480 --> 08:50.040
and then go to some numbers

08:50.040 --> 08:51.360
and then stack it up

08:51.360 --> 08:52.360
and then go to see this

08:52.360 --> 08:52.760
number

08:52.760 --> 08:54.760
is it related to the behavior we are interested in

08:54.760 --> 08:55.960
that this is the current

08:56.640 --> 08:59.520
method of molecular bio-hereditary behavior

08:59.520 --> 09:00.400
but the difficulties encountered

09:00.400 --> 09:01.880
is that there are quite a few

09:01.880 --> 09:03.680
that is, it takes about a few million

09:03.680 --> 09:04.360
to be able to

09:04.360 --> 09:06.280
estimate some more effective results

09:06.760 --> 09:07.200
that

09:07.200 --> 09:08.680
another question

09:08.680 --> 09:09.360
is

09:09.360 --> 09:10.080
just talked about

09:10.080 --> 09:10.800
they are through

09:10.800 --> 09:11.720
the effect of nucleotides

09:11.720 --> 09:12.840
stacked up

09:12.840 --> 09:13.640
so

09:13.640 --> 09:14.280
this paper

09:14.280 --> 09:15.160
they are looking at

09:15.160 --> 09:16.040
intelligence

09:16.040 --> 09:16.920
is intelligence

09:16.920 --> 09:17.440
this

09:17.960 --> 09:18.720
feature

09:18.720 --> 09:19.200
that

09:19.200 --> 09:19.960
assume that

09:19.960 --> 09:22.040
the variance between the groups

09:22.040 --> 09:23.080
is 100%

09:23.080 --> 09:23.840
and then go through

09:23.840 --> 09:24.360
nucleotides

09:24.360 --> 09:25.400
to estimate out of the value

09:25.400 --> 09:26.200
is probably

09:26.200 --> 09:27.160
genes can probably explain

09:27.160 --> 09:28.200
50% of the mutations

09:29.120 --> 09:30.480
but by stacking this method

09:30.480 --> 09:31.160
we can calculate

09:31.160 --> 09:31.800
it can explain

09:31.800 --> 09:33.240
about only 25%

09:33.240 --> 09:33.600
that

09:33.600 --> 09:34.440
the difference in the middle

09:34.440 --> 09:35.200
represents what

09:35.200 --> 09:35.680
it means

09:35.680 --> 09:36.840
these genes may not be

09:36.840 --> 09:38.440
a linear effect that can be stacked up

09:38.440 --> 09:39.360
but

09:39.360 --> 09:40.600
they will be related

09:40.600 --> 09:41.440
or interaction

09:41.440 --> 09:41.960
and so on

09:41.960 --> 09:42.360
so

09:42.360 --> 09:43.800
how to calculate

09:43.800 --> 09:44.800
those genome score

09:44.800 --> 09:45.240
that is

09:46.160 --> 09:47.120
the direction of future efforts

09:49.800 --> 09:50.120
yes

09:51.400 --> 09:52.560
the above is a brief introduction

09:52.560 --> 09:53.640
I want to stop

09:53.640 --> 09:55.400
to see if you have any questions

09:55.400 --> 09:55.760
and then

09:55.760 --> 09:56.400
if you have any questions

09:56.400 --> 09:58.080
you can directly turn on the microphone

10:00.080 --> 10:00.760
then welcome everyone

10:00.760 --> 10:02.080
directly turn on the microphone

10:02.080 --> 10:02.800
to ask questions

10:02.800 --> 10:04.120
or if everyone

10:04.560 --> 10:05.000
is

10:05.000 --> 10:06.520
you can also use chat

10:06.520 --> 10:07.080
that I can

10:07.080 --> 10:07.680
is to help you

10:08.360 --> 10:09.480
help you with the speaker

10:09.480 --> 10:10.640
is to ask

10:10.640 --> 10:11.080
the other

10:11.080 --> 10:12.920
if you have any questions

10:12.920 --> 10:13.640
also welcome everyone

10:13.640 --> 10:14.200
is a little

10:14.200 --> 10:14.720
one sentence

10:14.720 --> 10:16.360
can simply introduce yourself

10:16.360 --> 10:17.680
you can get to know each other

10:17.680 --> 10:18.160
thank you

10:22.160 --> 10:23.360
that if there is no problem

10:23.360 --> 10:23.960
is here

10:23.960 --> 10:24.800
want to emphasize

10:24.800 --> 10:25.400
is that every method

10:25.400 --> 10:26.640
of some restrictions

10:26.640 --> 10:27.320
but did not have

10:27.320 --> 10:28.440
a perfect research design

10:28.440 --> 10:29.280
so behavioral genetics

10:29.280 --> 10:31.000
can be integrated through different methods

10:31.000 --> 10:32.160
and then go to see a

10:32.160 --> 10:32.800
more stable

10:32.800 --> 10:33.600
can be found

10:33.600 --> 10:34.080
trend

10:34.080 --> 10:34.560
like this

10:38.360 --> 10:39.040
then we look at

10:39.040 --> 10:40.080
behavioral genetics

10:40.080 --> 10:40.600
I will be here

10:40.600 --> 10:42.040
with the example of biopsy research

10:42.040 --> 10:42.400
that he

10:42.400 --> 10:42.640
in the end

10:42.640 --> 10:43.320
how to study

10:43.320 --> 10:45.040
the impact of genes and the environment

10:45.040 --> 10:46.040
on the concept

10:46.040 --> 10:46.440
is the same

10:46.440 --> 10:47.480
we look at

10:47.480 --> 10:49.120
the relationship between individual genes

10:49.120 --> 10:50.320
with the relationship on the behavior

10:50.320 --> 10:51.160
that if this relationship

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
is significant, then

10:52.160 --> 10:53.080
we will say

10:53.080 --> 10:53.920
genes for us

10:53.920 --> 10:55.000
are interested in this behavior

10:55.000 --> 10:56.520
has a certain degree of impact

10:56.520 --> 10:57.080
and then we

10:57.080 --> 10:58.400
here to measure a biological term

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
called heritability

10:59.400 --> 11:00.160
it refers to

11:00.160 --> 11:02.280
how many degrees

11:02.280 --> 11:03.080
in the observed behavioral mutation

11:03.080 --> 11:04.680
can be explained by genes

11:04.680 --> 11:06.240
but because this is a method of measurement

11:06.240 --> 11:06.880
so specific

11:06.880 --> 11:07.720
in the end what is the gene

11:07.720 --> 11:08.880
we have no way to know

11:10.160 --> 11:11.680
that part of the environment

11:11.680 --> 11:12.960
we can further

11:12.960 --> 11:14.080
divide into shared

11:14.080 --> 11:15.720
and non-shared environment

11:15.720 --> 11:16.640
that first talk about

11:16.640 --> 11:17.720
the shared environment

11:17.720 --> 11:19.320
it refers to the environment

11:19.320 --> 11:19.960
those individuals

11:19.960 --> 11:21.840
they experience the same factors

11:21.840 --> 11:22.680
and these factors

11:22.680 --> 11:24.120
will make the individual

11:24.120 --> 11:24.960
for example, like

11:24.960 --> 11:25.480
twins

11:25.480 --> 11:27.560
their social status in the family

11:27.560 --> 11:28.480
living in the community

11:28.480 --> 11:30.440
or culture, etc.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.880
on the other hand,

11:31.880 --> 11:32.880
non-shared environment

11:32.880 --> 11:33.600
as the name implies

11:33.600 --> 11:34.760
is the environment

11:34.760 --> 11:35.320
each individual

11:35.320 --> 11:36.840
unique experience

11:36.840 --> 11:37.960
and these unique experiences

11:37.960 --> 11:38.640
in theory

11:38.640 --> 11:40.160
will cause differences between individuals

11:40.160 --> 11:40.560
such as

11:41.080 --> 11:41.600
accidents

11:41.600 --> 11:43.720
or miscalculations, etc.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.640
so just like today

11:44.640 --> 11:45.360
a pair of twins

11:45.360 --> 11:46.040
if there is a person

11:46.040 --> 11:46.880
with COVID

11:46.880 --> 11:47.480
cough

11:47.480 --> 11:48.320
the other person does not

11:48.320 --> 11:49.560
then they sleep in different rooms

11:49.560 --> 11:50.360
one person will be sick

11:50.360 --> 11:51.320
one person will not

11:51.320 --> 11:52.120
so although they are

11:52.120 --> 11:52.920
twins

11:52.920 --> 11:53.960
but their life experience

11:53.960 --> 11:55.480
will not be exactly the same

11:55.480 --> 11:56.480
or say

11:56.480 --> 11:58.560
they are in the uterus

11:58.560 --> 11:59.920
the position of the left bed is different

11:59.920 --> 12:00.920
maybe one is above

12:00.920 --> 12:01.800
one is below

12:01.800 --> 12:02.520
so

12:02.520 --> 12:03.440
the difference in the environment

12:03.440 --> 12:04.480
will not be born to them

12:04.480 --> 12:05.120
early birth

12:05.120 --> 12:07.120
that physical development

12:07.120 --> 12:07.920
is there any impact

12:07.920 --> 12:08.400
that

12:08.400 --> 12:09.880
this is also possible to cause

12:09.880 --> 12:11.080
different factors

12:11.080 --> 12:12.440
of same-egg twins

12:15.040 --> 12:15.480
specifically

12:15.480 --> 12:17.040
how do we calculate it

12:17.040 --> 12:18.000
is that we are through

12:18.000 --> 12:19.080
the similarity between individual

12:19.080 --> 12:20.600
and behavior

12:20.600 --> 12:22.160
that is to collect some

12:22.160 --> 12:23.280
correlation

12:23.280 --> 12:24.040
so we will collect

12:24.040 --> 12:25.040
their behavioral data

12:25.040 --> 12:26.680
and then in the model

12:26.680 --> 12:27.160
we will have

12:27.160 --> 12:28.840
twin 1 and twin 2

12:28.840 --> 12:29.600
in this order

12:29.600 --> 12:30.320
we will try to

12:30.320 --> 12:31.600
we will randomize

12:31.600 --> 12:33.160
to reduce some errors

12:34.240 --> 12:34.760
ok

12:35.800 --> 12:36.960
and then in the model

12:36.960 --> 12:38.400
we will put three factors

12:38.400 --> 12:39.400
that is

12:39.400 --> 12:40.040
gene

12:40.040 --> 12:41.360
and then the shared environment

12:41.360 --> 12:42.800
and the non-shared environment

12:42.800 --> 12:43.520
and then we will try

12:43.520 --> 12:44.480
to use these three factors

12:44.480 --> 12:45.120
to predict

12:45.120 --> 12:46.560
their behavioral mutations

12:46.560 --> 12:47.360
like this

12:47.360 --> 12:47.520
ok

12:47.520 --> 12:48.120
that

12:48.120 --> 12:49.080
part of the parameters

12:49.080 --> 12:50.720
is our assumption

12:50.720 --> 12:50.920
ok

12:50.920 --> 12:52.880
then we start from the gene

12:52.880 --> 12:54.200
for same-egg twins

12:54.200 --> 12:54.720
that is

12:54.720 --> 12:56.040
monozygotic twins

12:56.040 --> 12:57.240
so they are mz

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
that because they share

12:58.240 --> 12:59.360
100% of the gene

12:59.360 --> 13:00.200
so we will

13:00.200 --> 13:01.520
put the correlation here

13:01.520 --> 13:01.960
is 1

13:01.960 --> 13:02.800
assume

13:02.800 --> 13:04.120
the two genes

13:04.120 --> 13:04.560
um

13:04.560 --> 13:05.160
the impression

13:05.160 --> 13:06.360
is exactly the same

13:07.240 --> 13:07.720
ok

13:07.720 --> 13:09.160
what about monozygotic twins

13:09.160 --> 13:09.600
that is

13:09.600 --> 13:10.840
dizygotic twins

13:10.840 --> 13:12.200
they share

13:12.200 --> 13:14.040
50% of the gene on average

13:14.040 --> 13:14.200
oh

13:14.200 --> 13:15.240
the gene here refers to

13:15.240 --> 13:17.480
the 1.3% gene unique to humans

13:17.480 --> 13:18.200
because we share with

13:18.200 --> 13:19.280
black stars

13:19.280 --> 13:20.880
98.7%

13:20.880 --> 13:21.240
ok

13:21.240 --> 13:21.720
so

13:21.720 --> 13:22.120
that is

13:22.120 --> 13:23.200
for monozygotic twins

13:23.200 --> 13:23.800
this factor

13:23.800 --> 13:25.040
we will put 0.5

13:25.040 --> 13:25.440
as

13:25.440 --> 13:27.240
the parameter in our model

13:27.240 --> 13:27.920
ok

13:27.920 --> 13:28.320
that

13:28.320 --> 13:29.440
shared environment

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
because they will all

13:30.440 --> 13:31.880
grow up in the same family

13:31.880 --> 13:32.360
so

13:32.360 --> 13:32.920
for

13:32.920 --> 13:34.120
same-egg and monozygotic twins

13:34.120 --> 13:34.800
we assume

13:34.800 --> 13:35.680
this shared environment

13:35.680 --> 13:37.320
has the same impact on them

13:37.320 --> 13:38.360
so we will

13:38.360 --> 13:39.520
put 1

13:39.520 --> 13:41.120
as their correlation

13:41.120 --> 13:41.680
and

13:41.680 --> 13:42.160
in addition

13:42.160 --> 13:43.840
in the non-shared environment

13:43.840 --> 13:45.240
there is no assumption

13:45.240 --> 13:45.880
because

13:45.880 --> 13:46.160
um

13:46.160 --> 13:47.280
for each individual

13:47.280 --> 13:48.480
logically

13:48.480 --> 13:49.360
it is unique

13:49.360 --> 13:49.800
so we will

13:49.800 --> 13:50.840
make it an independent event

13:51.920 --> 13:52.200
and

13:52.200 --> 13:53.120
put it here

13:53.120 --> 13:53.960
if you have studied

13:53.960 --> 13:55.160
psychology-related courses

13:55.160 --> 13:56.320
you may have a little impression

13:56.320 --> 13:57.080
formula

13:57.080 --> 13:57.560
so

13:57.560 --> 13:58.360
we just talked about

13:58.360 --> 13:58.920
our analysis

13:58.920 --> 13:59.360
is to analyze

13:59.360 --> 14:01.080
the correlation between twins

14:01.080 --> 14:01.920
so we will say

14:01.920 --> 14:02.520
that

14:02.520 --> 14:04.440
usually the correlation between twins

14:04.440 --> 14:04.920
cause

14:04.920 --> 14:05.880
the reason for this correlation

14:05.880 --> 14:06.360
is because

14:06.360 --> 14:07.200
they have 100%

14:07.200 --> 14:08.160
the same genes

14:08.160 --> 14:08.800
and 100%

14:08.800 --> 14:10.080
the same environment

14:10.080 --> 14:10.320
so

14:10.320 --> 14:11.040
the correlation between

14:11.040 --> 14:11.960
the same-egg and monozygotic twins

14:11.960 --> 14:12.800
will be

14:12.800 --> 14:14.400
half of the same genes

14:14.400 --> 14:15.000
plus

14:15.000 --> 14:15.440
their

14:15.440 --> 14:15.960
100%

14:15.960 --> 14:16.760
the same environment

14:16.760 --> 14:17.840
to explain

14:17.840 --> 14:18.160
and

14:18.160 --> 14:18.840
it should be quite obvious

14:18.840 --> 14:19.520
that

14:19.520 --> 14:19.840
for

14:19.840 --> 14:21.440
the prediction of the non-shared environment

14:21.440 --> 14:22.080
we will

14:22.080 --> 14:23.040
subtract the correlation between

14:23.040 --> 14:23.840
the same-egg and monozygotic twins

14:23.840 --> 14:24.600
by 1

14:28.720 --> 14:28.960
so

14:28.960 --> 14:29.280
next

14:29.280 --> 14:30.320
I want to share

14:30.320 --> 14:31.520
this paper

14:31.520 --> 14:31.880
um

14:31.880 --> 14:32.560
this paper

14:32.560 --> 14:32.800
is written by

14:32.800 --> 14:34.040
Robin Pullman

14:34.040 --> 14:34.320
and

14:34.320 --> 14:34.920
he should be

14:34.920 --> 14:35.960
the most famous

14:35.960 --> 14:37.120
behavioral geneticist

14:37.120 --> 14:37.600
at least

14:37.600 --> 14:38.240
in psychology

14:38.240 --> 14:39.200
it's like this

14:39.200 --> 14:39.400
so

14:39.400 --> 14:40.120
if you are interested

14:40.120 --> 14:41.000
you can look it up

14:41.000 --> 14:42.040
he listed 10 points

14:42.040 --> 14:42.640
that can be stabilized

14:42.640 --> 14:43.320
by replicating

14:43.320 --> 14:43.840
some

14:43.840 --> 14:44.600
results

14:44.600 --> 14:44.800
so

14:44.800 --> 14:46.080
I will talk about two

14:46.080 --> 14:46.480
um

14:46.480 --> 14:47.160
the first one

14:47.160 --> 14:49.320
I want you to guess

14:49.320 --> 14:51.080
how much of human intelligence

14:51.080 --> 14:52.800
can be determined by genes

14:52.800 --> 14:53.520
and

14:53.520 --> 14:53.800
um

14:53.800 --> 14:55.200
in the process of growth

14:55.200 --> 14:56.480
the part that genes can explain

14:56.480 --> 14:57.800
will change over time

14:57.800 --> 14:58.680
or less

14:58.680 --> 14:59.080
and

14:59.080 --> 14:59.720
I'll give you

14:59.720 --> 15:00.480
10 seconds

15:00.480 --> 15:01.640
to guess

15:01.640 --> 15:02.520
in your heart

15:05.960 --> 15:06.480
ok

15:06.480 --> 15:06.760
so

15:06.760 --> 15:07.000
um

15:07.000 --> 15:07.680
this result

15:07.680 --> 15:08.200
is a

15:08.200 --> 15:09.080
meta-analysis

15:09.080 --> 15:09.560
so

15:09.560 --> 15:10.160
they

15:10.160 --> 15:11.000
compared

15:11.000 --> 15:11.400
in

15:11.400 --> 15:12.080
childhood

15:12.080 --> 15:12.800
adolescence

15:12.800 --> 15:13.200
and

15:13.200 --> 15:13.960
early adulthood

15:13.960 --> 15:14.600
and

15:14.600 --> 15:15.160
um

15:15.160 --> 15:15.960
behavioral genetics

15:15.960 --> 15:16.600
they saw

15:16.600 --> 15:17.320
how much of the genes

15:17.320 --> 15:17.800
can explain

15:17.800 --> 15:18.600
the proportion of intelligence

15:18.600 --> 15:19.000
and

15:19.000 --> 15:20.040
what they found

15:20.040 --> 15:20.600
is that

15:20.600 --> 15:21.800
in childhood

15:21.800 --> 15:22.200
um

15:22.200 --> 15:23.160
genes can explain

15:23.160 --> 15:24.720
about 40% of the changes

15:24.720 --> 15:25.160
but

15:25.160 --> 15:26.080
in adulthood

15:26.080 --> 15:27.000
genes can explain

15:27.000 --> 15:28.320
up to 70%

15:28.320 --> 15:28.760
and

15:28.760 --> 15:29.360
we see

15:29.360 --> 15:29.600
in the

15:29.600 --> 15:30.360
early childhood

15:30.360 --> 15:31.080
we can see

15:31.080 --> 15:31.400
that

15:31.400 --> 15:31.760
um

15:31.760 --> 15:32.200
the genes

15:32.200 --> 15:32.760
can explain

15:32.760 --> 15:33.200
about

15:33.200 --> 15:34.040
50% of the changes

15:34.040 --> 15:34.560
and

15:34.560 --> 15:35.160
in the

15:35.160 --> 15:36.720
early adulthood

15:36.720 --> 15:37.360
we see

15:37.360 --> 15:38.600
the effect of sharing the environment

15:38.600 --> 15:39.360
is less

15:40.280 --> 15:40.560
yes

15:40.560 --> 15:41.240
I don't know if this is

15:41.240 --> 15:42.360
a surprising discovery

15:42.360 --> 15:42.960
because

15:42.960 --> 15:43.800
maybe someone will think

15:43.800 --> 15:44.720
after we are born

15:44.720 --> 15:45.320
we are constantly

15:45.320 --> 15:46.480
disturbed by the environment

15:46.480 --> 15:47.120
and

15:47.120 --> 15:47.680
the environment

15:47.680 --> 15:49.080
may have a

15:49.080 --> 15:50.520
positive effect on our body

15:50.520 --> 15:50.840
but

15:50.840 --> 15:51.640
at least in intelligence

15:51.640 --> 15:52.280
we see

15:52.280 --> 15:52.560
a

15:52.560 --> 15:53.880
opposite result

15:53.880 --> 15:54.240
um

15:54.240 --> 15:54.720
so

15:54.720 --> 15:54.960
um

15:54.960 --> 15:55.760
how did behavioral genetics

15:55.760 --> 15:56.440
explain

15:56.440 --> 15:57.680
this phenomenon

15:57.680 --> 15:58.280
we think

15:58.280 --> 15:58.760
it's because

15:58.760 --> 15:59.480
as a person

15:59.480 --> 16:00.040
develops

16:00.040 --> 16:01.160
he has a better

16:01.160 --> 16:03.400
control of his environment

16:03.400 --> 16:04.280
so

16:04.400 --> 16:04.560
yes

16:04.560 --> 16:05.160
how does a person

16:05.160 --> 16:06.200
decide his environment

16:06.200 --> 16:06.960
most of the time

16:06.960 --> 16:07.720
we will choose

16:07.720 --> 16:08.280
those that meet

16:08.280 --> 16:08.960
our

16:08.960 --> 16:10.000
conditions

16:10.000 --> 16:10.720
we feel comfortable

16:10.720 --> 16:11.960
we stay there

16:11.960 --> 16:12.680
so

16:12.680 --> 16:14.280
it should be through this logic

16:14.280 --> 16:14.480
but

16:14.480 --> 16:15.160
you can imagine

16:15.160 --> 16:15.960
when you were a child

16:15.960 --> 16:16.560
a lot of things

16:16.560 --> 16:18.280
are decided by parents

16:18.280 --> 16:18.600
and

16:18.600 --> 16:19.160
after growing up

16:19.160 --> 16:19.720
we can

16:19.720 --> 16:20.560
control more and more

16:20.560 --> 16:22.040
details in our lives

16:22.040 --> 16:22.480
like

16:22.480 --> 16:23.160
we are not

16:23.160 --> 16:23.960
after growing up

16:23.960 --> 16:24.280
more and more

16:24.280 --> 16:24.960
indecisive

16:24.960 --> 16:25.120
but

16:25.120 --> 16:25.880
we won't

16:25.880 --> 16:26.920
let things we don't like

16:26.920 --> 16:27.520
appear on

16:27.520 --> 16:29.120
our table

16:29.120 --> 16:30.680
yes

16:30.680 --> 16:31.200
oh

16:31.200 --> 16:31.560
what about

16:31.560 --> 16:32.600
the second study

16:32.600 --> 16:34.640
they looked at

16:34.640 --> 16:36.280
the negative attitude of

16:36.280 --> 16:37.960
teenagers' antisocial behavior and mothers

16:37.960 --> 16:39.080
they studied

16:39.080 --> 16:40.560
teenagers' twins

16:40.560 --> 16:41.720
so

16:41.720 --> 16:42.760
teenagers' mothers

16:42.760 --> 16:43.240
are like

16:43.240 --> 16:44.600
an environmental factor

16:47.040 --> 16:47.520
so

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
what did they find

16:48.520 --> 16:49.480
they found

16:49.480 --> 16:49.720
ok

16:49.720 --> 16:51.000
the negative attitude of mothers

16:51.000 --> 16:51.880
sounds like

16:51.880 --> 16:53.400
a shared environmental factor

16:53.400 --> 16:53.680
but

16:53.680 --> 16:54.440
when they ran

16:54.440 --> 16:55.200
that model

16:55.200 --> 16:56.080
they found

16:56.080 --> 16:56.760
genes

16:56.760 --> 16:57.520
shared environment

16:57.520 --> 16:58.720
and non-shared environment

16:58.720 --> 17:00.040
can significantly explain

17:00.040 --> 17:02.000
the relationship between these two concepts

17:02.080 --> 17:02.640
so

17:03.040 --> 17:03.800
there are a few

17:03.800 --> 17:04.640
interesting

17:04.640 --> 17:04.960
results

17:04.960 --> 17:05.920
we can discuss

17:05.920 --> 17:06.320
like

17:06.320 --> 17:06.960
the first one

17:06.960 --> 17:07.520
we found

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
individuals in the environment

17:08.520 --> 17:09.040
are not

17:09.040 --> 17:10.640
passively affected by the environment

17:10.640 --> 17:11.000
but

17:11.000 --> 17:12.640
those seem to be environmental factors

17:12.640 --> 17:13.320
to some extent

17:13.320 --> 17:14.040
reflect some of their

17:14.040 --> 17:15.320
genetic characteristics

17:16.280 --> 17:17.080
you can imagine

17:17.080 --> 17:19.000
when interacting with people

17:19.000 --> 17:19.840
we are not

17:19.840 --> 17:20.920
interacting with them

17:20.920 --> 17:21.960
in the same way

17:21.960 --> 17:22.240
like

17:22.240 --> 17:23.040
if you meet someone

17:23.040 --> 17:24.280
who smiles more often today

17:24.280 --> 17:25.320
you will

17:25.320 --> 17:26.400
respond

17:26.400 --> 17:28.160
smile more often

17:28.160 --> 17:28.600
so I think

17:28.600 --> 17:30.280
this result is quite interesting

17:30.280 --> 17:30.680
like

17:30.680 --> 17:34.080
some of the conditions of parents

17:34.080 --> 17:34.760
are often thought to be

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
a shared environment

17:35.760 --> 17:36.120
but

17:36.120 --> 17:36.680
they may also be

17:36.680 --> 17:38.120
affected by the genes of their children

17:38.120 --> 17:38.440
so

17:38.440 --> 17:39.080
parents may

17:39.080 --> 17:40.600
interact with their children

17:40.600 --> 17:41.680
in the same way

17:41.680 --> 17:42.400
it is a bit like

17:42.400 --> 17:43.480
the parent-to-parent relationship

17:43.480 --> 17:44.960
shared by the high-level intelligence

17:44.960 --> 17:45.480
maybe

17:45.480 --> 17:47.280
the parents have too high requirements

17:47.280 --> 17:47.440
so

17:47.440 --> 17:47.760
I think

17:47.760 --> 17:48.240
this result

17:48.240 --> 17:49.840
can comfort some parents

17:49.840 --> 17:50.360
like

17:50.360 --> 17:50.560
oh

17:50.560 --> 17:51.120
no

17:51.120 --> 17:51.880
like

17:51.880 --> 17:52.720
you may do something

17:52.720 --> 17:53.800
and the child will not respond

17:53.800 --> 17:55.200
or

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
what you do

17:56.200 --> 17:57.200
is because the child

17:57.200 --> 17:58.720
makes you do this

17:58.720 --> 17:59.840
and so on

18:00.280 --> 18:01.520
then

18:01.520 --> 18:04.400
some environmental factors of parents

18:04.400 --> 18:04.760
such as

18:04.760 --> 18:05.920
this negative attitude

18:05.920 --> 18:06.560
it can also

18:06.560 --> 18:08.600
cause individual differences

18:08.600 --> 18:09.960
if everyone has brothers and sisters

18:09.960 --> 18:10.880
it may be easier to imagine

18:10.880 --> 18:11.080
that

18:11.080 --> 18:11.560
there will always be

18:11.560 --> 18:13.200
when parents are biased

18:13.200 --> 18:13.840
although

18:13.840 --> 18:14.400
this mother

18:14.400 --> 18:16.360
may have a negative attitude

18:16.360 --> 18:17.880
is higher than average

18:17.880 --> 18:18.040
but

18:18.040 --> 18:18.880
her negative attitude

18:18.880 --> 18:20.560
may only target a certain child

18:20.560 --> 18:20.880
so

18:20.880 --> 18:22.160
such a relationship

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
will cause

18:23.160 --> 18:24.120
differences between individuals

18:26.640 --> 18:26.800
yes

18:26.800 --> 18:27.040
so

18:27.040 --> 18:28.080
let's stop here

18:28.080 --> 18:30.280
do you have any questions?

18:30.280 --> 18:30.920
hello

18:30.920 --> 18:32.040
I would like to ask

18:32.640 --> 18:33.560
my name is Shi Qinghua

18:33.560 --> 18:36.080
Shi Toushi

18:36.080 --> 18:37.800
Tsinghua University

18:37.800 --> 18:38.680
I would like to ask

18:38.680 --> 18:39.640
about

18:39.640 --> 18:40.800
the paper

18:40.800 --> 18:41.440
on self-discipline

18:41.440 --> 18:43.040
about self-discipline

18:43.040 --> 18:44.960
their explanation is that

18:44.960 --> 18:45.640
after adulthood

18:45.640 --> 18:48.280
it is better to master the environment

18:48.280 --> 18:48.960
then

18:48.960 --> 18:50.960
such a component

18:50.960 --> 18:52.120
if like us

18:52.120 --> 18:55.040
international students

18:55.040 --> 18:55.920
will there be any changes

18:55.920 --> 18:56.840
did they discuss it?

18:56.840 --> 18:58.080
because we are

18:58.080 --> 18:58.600
in an environment

18:58.600 --> 18:59.800
that we are not familiar with

18:59.800 --> 19:01.560
and do not have a good grasp of

19:02.840 --> 19:03.120
oh

19:03.120 --> 19:03.840
understand

19:03.840 --> 19:04.240
but I think

19:04.240 --> 19:05.360
their paper on self-discipline

19:05.360 --> 19:07.280
may be more like

19:07.280 --> 19:08.440
the kind of self-discipline

19:08.440 --> 19:10.920
that will not be affected by language

19:10.920 --> 19:12.120
so

19:12.120 --> 19:12.800
I was thinking

19:12.800 --> 19:13.720
that

19:13.720 --> 19:14.880
the part about international students

19:14.880 --> 19:15.920
is that

19:15.920 --> 19:16.600
the way of measuring

19:16.600 --> 19:17.920
will it be more unfavorable for us

19:17.920 --> 19:19.360
this kind of miscalculation?

19:20.600 --> 19:21.040
not entirely

19:21.040 --> 19:22.360
because like us

19:22.360 --> 19:23.480
to a new environment

19:23.480 --> 19:23.920
especially

19:23.920 --> 19:25.520
when it is a very unfamiliar environment

19:26.520 --> 19:27.200
many times

19:27.200 --> 19:28.040
our performance

19:28.040 --> 19:29.280
is actually

19:29.280 --> 19:30.680
likely to be

19:30.680 --> 19:32.160
worse at the beginning

19:32.160 --> 19:32.520
of course

19:32.520 --> 19:33.280
it is also

19:33.280 --> 19:34.320
more in line with what they said

19:34.320 --> 19:35.360
because we are in an environment

19:35.360 --> 19:36.720
after getting used to

19:36.720 --> 19:38.480
will perform better

19:38.480 --> 19:40.280
but we

19:40.280 --> 19:41.040
in fact, I just want to say

19:41.040 --> 19:41.560
that we will not

19:41.560 --> 19:42.280
because of the environment

19:42.280 --> 19:43.080
to become a little stupid

19:43.080 --> 19:44.120
like this

19:44.120 --> 19:46.080
I think it will

19:46.080 --> 19:47.120
there is a

19:47.120 --> 19:48.480
more related

19:48.480 --> 19:48.960
but they are

19:48.960 --> 19:50.840
discussing the social economic status

19:50.840 --> 19:52.040
is the parents

19:52.040 --> 19:52.840
is the family

19:52.840 --> 19:53.920
those social status

19:53.920 --> 19:54.640
and so on

19:54.680 --> 19:55.960
and then they found

19:55.960 --> 19:57.360
that there is an interaction

19:57.360 --> 19:57.680
that is

19:57.680 --> 19:58.280
if you are

19:58.280 --> 19:59.680
social economic status

19:59.680 --> 20:01.160
family resources more

20:01.160 --> 20:03.400
your genes can be better

20:03.400 --> 20:04.560
but if your resources

20:04.560 --> 20:05.280
less

20:05.280 --> 20:06.640
most of the environment is oppressive

20:06.640 --> 20:07.440
and then the environment

20:07.440 --> 20:08.080
to explain

20:08.080 --> 20:08.440
you that

20:08.440 --> 20:10.000
the bad performance of the intelligence

20:11.800 --> 20:12.400
yes

20:12.400 --> 20:12.840
understand

20:12.840 --> 20:13.600
thank you

20:13.600 --> 20:15.000
hope to answer the question

20:15.000 --> 20:15.600
but they do

20:15.600 --> 20:16.880
is the social economic status

20:16.880 --> 20:17.480
but I think

20:17.480 --> 20:18.000
that is

20:18.000 --> 20:18.880
discussing

20:18.880 --> 20:19.680
that

20:19.680 --> 20:20.880
the whole environmental change

20:20.880 --> 20:21.960
is also quite interesting

20:23.760 --> 20:24.480
Hi

20:24.480 --> 20:25.520
I have a question

20:26.040 --> 20:26.920
Hi

20:26.920 --> 20:27.160
Hi

20:27.160 --> 20:27.560
I am

20:27.560 --> 20:29.320
my name is Qiao En

20:29.320 --> 20:30.280
I want to follow

20:30.280 --> 20:31.000
just that

20:31.000 --> 20:32.160
the question of Tsinghua

20:32.160 --> 20:33.680
want to ask is that

20:33.680 --> 20:34.560
that

20:34.560 --> 20:35.120
is because

20:35.120 --> 20:36.920
after a long time

20:36.920 --> 20:37.680
you see it

20:37.680 --> 20:38.560
seems

20:38.560 --> 20:41.600
the amount of gene explanation is rising

20:41.600 --> 20:42.120
that

20:42.120 --> 20:43.880
this means that

20:43.880 --> 20:44.560
it will come to us

20:44.560 --> 20:45.160
when we are adults

20:45.160 --> 20:45.800
we choose

20:45.800 --> 20:47.240
to have

20:47.240 --> 20:47.720
should be like this

20:47.720 --> 20:47.920
oh

20:47.920 --> 20:49.480
I have to ask the question

20:49.480 --> 20:50.240
should say that

20:50.240 --> 20:51.520
how is it

20:51.520 --> 20:52.600
the real state

20:52.600 --> 20:54.360
is that after we are adults

20:54.440 --> 20:55.520
see that

20:55.520 --> 20:56.040
the performance

20:56.040 --> 20:57.400
is in line with

20:57.400 --> 20:58.480
the real gene explanation

20:58.480 --> 20:59.560
or our childhood

20:59.560 --> 21:00.440
that is

21:02.440 --> 21:03.480
I think this question

21:03.480 --> 21:04.200
is very interesting

21:04.200 --> 21:05.520
I personally will be more inclined

21:05.520 --> 21:06.120
I think

21:06.120 --> 21:06.880
during adulthood

21:06.880 --> 21:07.600
we really have

21:07.600 --> 21:08.720
complete autonomy

21:08.720 --> 21:09.440
measured things

21:09.440 --> 21:10.320
is true

21:10.320 --> 21:10.840
but I think it

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
behind the reaction is quite a lot

21:11.840 --> 21:13.080
is that you want to see

21:13.080 --> 21:13.880
development

21:14.640 --> 21:17.280
is the concept of the human development process

21:17.280 --> 21:18.160
I am more inclined

21:18.160 --> 21:18.640
to adulthood

21:18.640 --> 21:19.400
this result

21:19.760 --> 21:20.400
is good

21:20.960 --> 21:21.320
thank you

21:21.320 --> 21:21.920
I also think so

21:21.920 --> 21:23.080
I just want to know

21:23.080 --> 21:24.120
what do you think

21:25.000 --> 21:25.560
thank you

21:27.000 --> 21:27.680
that means

21:27.680 --> 21:29.000
there is a question here

21:29.000 --> 21:29.960
Gao Xian, do you want to ask yourself

21:29.960 --> 21:31.280
ask yourself

21:32.600 --> 21:33.200
ok

21:33.200 --> 21:33.840
I also posted it

21:33.840 --> 21:34.920
on the chat room

21:34.920 --> 21:36.320
I am quite curious

21:36.320 --> 21:36.760
that

21:37.320 --> 21:37.520
ok

21:37.520 --> 21:38.200
I ask directly

21:38.200 --> 21:38.800
that is

21:38.800 --> 21:39.440
twins

21:39.440 --> 21:40.000
they may

21:40.000 --> 21:41.080
have different

21:41.080 --> 21:43.120
interactions with the environment

21:43.120 --> 21:43.920
their genes

21:43.920 --> 21:45.040
may have some disappearance

21:45.040 --> 21:46.000
for example, the fake plan

21:46.000 --> 21:46.440
and so on

21:46.440 --> 21:47.880
as a chemistry

21:47.880 --> 21:48.360
assistant

21:48.360 --> 21:49.520
I ask this question

21:49.520 --> 21:50.400
if this matter

21:50.400 --> 21:51.840
is also considered

21:51.840 --> 21:52.760
then we

21:52.760 --> 21:53.800
you just

21:53.800 --> 21:55.080
mentioned in the last page

21:55.080 --> 21:56.200
we assume

21:56.200 --> 21:58.120
when talking about the parameter

21:58.120 --> 21:59.000
you said

21:59.000 --> 21:59.720
twin genes

21:59.720 --> 22:01.200
we assume it is related to 1

22:01.200 --> 22:02.120
but if we

22:02.120 --> 22:02.600
consider

22:02.600 --> 22:03.160
these

22:03.160 --> 22:04.400
modified

22:04.400 --> 22:05.520
issues

22:05.520 --> 22:05.920
that obviously

22:05.920 --> 22:07.360
should not be 1

22:07.360 --> 22:07.960
that is

22:07.960 --> 22:08.560
I do not know

22:08.560 --> 22:09.240
this matter

22:09.240 --> 22:10.440
on behavioral genetics

22:10.440 --> 22:11.720
how to consider

22:13.680 --> 22:14.720
I think

22:15.960 --> 22:16.960
I think they

22:16.960 --> 22:17.240
oh

22:17.240 --> 22:18.440
behavioral genetics

22:18.440 --> 22:19.960
it will explain the method

22:19.960 --> 22:21.720
because you are in the process of the process of

22:21.920 --> 22:23.280
gene is exactly the same

22:23.280 --> 22:24.000
so that causes you

22:24.000 --> 22:25.320
behind the fake plan process

22:25.320 --> 22:26.200
will be classified as

22:26.200 --> 22:27.280
non-shared environment

22:27.280 --> 22:28.040
is the environment

22:28.040 --> 22:29.800
stimulate the performance of your fake plan

22:29.800 --> 22:30.360
like this

22:31.840 --> 22:33.240
but indeed we can go to see

22:33.240 --> 22:34.520
the environment and gene

22:34.520 --> 22:35.720
some of the interaction

22:37.000 --> 22:37.760
so that

22:37.760 --> 22:38.920
it feels like

22:38.920 --> 22:39.880
I do not know

22:39.880 --> 22:40.400
in

22:40.400 --> 22:41.480
statistics on this matter

22:41.480 --> 22:43.440
how you will go to run this analysis

22:43.440 --> 22:44.360
but it feels like

22:44.360 --> 22:46.280
genes and the following

22:47.400 --> 22:48.280
environment

22:48.280 --> 22:48.960
these two variables

22:48.960 --> 22:49.800
may be related to

22:49.800 --> 22:50.440
is not it

22:52.240 --> 22:53.400
in the model

22:53.400 --> 22:54.880
is not related

22:55.720 --> 22:57.080
to the assumption is not related

22:57.080 --> 22:57.920
but in statistics

22:57.920 --> 22:58.200
is not it

22:58.200 --> 22:59.040
may be related

22:59.040 --> 22:59.960
to the statistics

22:59.960 --> 23:00.680
I do not know how you

23:00.680 --> 23:01.200
run analysis

23:01.200 --> 23:02.320
but I think in statistics

23:02.320 --> 23:03.400
is not it

23:03.400 --> 23:04.240
that is between the variables

23:04.240 --> 23:05.840
there is a relationship

23:05.840 --> 23:06.560
but may not have

23:06.560 --> 23:07.360
a contributory problem

23:07.360 --> 23:07.880
but

23:07.880 --> 23:09.000
I understand

23:09.000 --> 23:10.120
your assumption

23:10.800 --> 23:12.400
I can comment on a small

23:13.040 --> 23:13.640
good

23:13.640 --> 23:14.400
is

23:14.400 --> 23:15.720
epigenetics

23:15.720 --> 23:17.280
side of the impact

23:17.280 --> 23:18.600
in fact, a large part

23:18.600 --> 23:20.560
is from the environment

23:20.560 --> 23:22.560
so in fact it can

23:22.560 --> 23:24.040
even if its epigenetic mutations

23:24.040 --> 23:26.680
or mutations of histone modification

23:26.680 --> 23:27.920
or other

23:27.920 --> 23:29.280
modifications of the difference

23:29.280 --> 23:30.920
in fact, a lot from the

23:30.920 --> 23:32.680
impact of the environment

23:32.680 --> 23:34.440
so in fact it should be

23:34.440 --> 23:35.440
if I were

23:35.440 --> 23:36.640
I would tend to put it

23:36.640 --> 23:39.080
on the effect of the environment

23:39.080 --> 23:40.640
like before there is a

23:40.640 --> 23:41.080
study

23:41.080 --> 23:41.960
it is a

23:41.960 --> 23:44.040
identical twin

23:44.040 --> 23:45.000
one up in space

23:45.000 --> 23:46.280
one did not go to space

23:46.280 --> 23:48.480
and then under the influence of neutrality

23:48.480 --> 23:50.040
their genetics

23:50.040 --> 23:50.840
part of the same

23:50.840 --> 23:51.960
but epigenetic

23:51.960 --> 23:52.680
modification

23:52.680 --> 23:55.080
is very, very large

23:55.080 --> 23:56.240
so it should still

23:56.240 --> 23:58.040
count on the impact of the environment

24:01.240 --> 24:01.840
thank you

24:01.840 --> 24:03.960
I just tried to

24:03.960 --> 24:05.040
express this thing

24:05.040 --> 24:06.200
but I am actually a little

24:06.200 --> 24:07.000
hesitant

24:07.000 --> 24:07.560
about

24:07.560 --> 24:08.720
if it is epigenetic

24:08.720 --> 24:09.600
it seems to be through

24:09.600 --> 24:10.640
the gene pathway

24:10.640 --> 24:11.840
but conceptually we will put it

24:11.840 --> 24:13.720
on the non-shared environment

24:13.720 --> 24:14.880
this factor

24:18.480 --> 24:19.240
thank you

24:19.240 --> 24:20.000
understand

24:20.000 --> 24:20.800
you are welcome

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
that

24:21.800 --> 24:23.680
we still have other questions

24:26.680 --> 24:28.160
that I will continue

24:28.160 --> 24:28.720
that

24:28.720 --> 24:31.640
will move to the next part of our laboratory

24:32.320 --> 24:33.840
that we are called

24:33.840 --> 24:34.320
the laboratory

24:34.320 --> 24:35.040
PhD

24:35.040 --> 24:36.160
Twin Project

24:36.160 --> 24:37.560
and then my boss is PI

24:37.560 --> 24:38.560
that we have done two

24:38.560 --> 24:40.120
long-term tracking

24:40.120 --> 24:40.840
first plan is to see

24:40.840 --> 24:42.160
two to three years old

24:42.160 --> 24:42.880
and then the second

24:42.880 --> 24:44.200
is another set of children

24:44.200 --> 24:46.080
and then from three years old to five years old

24:46.080 --> 24:47.240
that my research is mainly

24:47.240 --> 24:48.480
for the second database

24:48.480 --> 24:50.080
is three to five years old before school

24:50.080 --> 24:50.800
this stage

24:51.800 --> 24:52.960
that our database

24:52.960 --> 24:54.240
there are 310

24:54.240 --> 24:55.760
twins of the same gender

24:55.760 --> 24:57.720
and then a little bit less than

24:57.720 --> 24:58.320
here

24:58.320 --> 24:59.160
it is worth noting that

24:59.160 --> 25:00.520
we are talking about the same gender

25:00.520 --> 25:01.680
because the same gender twins

25:01.680 --> 25:02.680
must be the same gender

25:02.680 --> 25:03.520
but the same gender

25:03.520 --> 25:04.400
may be the same gender

25:04.400 --> 25:05.480
may be the same gender

25:05.480 --> 25:06.600
that we want to reduce

25:06.600 --> 25:08.120
some of the gender-caused

25:08.120 --> 25:08.800
measurement errors

25:08.800 --> 25:09.520
so we agreed to

25:09.520 --> 25:11.080
receive twins of the same gender

25:11.760 --> 25:12.360
and then

25:12.360 --> 25:13.440
I have a little story here

25:13.440 --> 25:14.160
on the first year

25:14.160 --> 25:15.360
when I still have a chance to talk to the boss

25:15.360 --> 25:16.720
face to face

25:16.720 --> 25:17.400
I asked him

25:17.400 --> 25:19.200
where to find so many twins

25:19.200 --> 25:19.840
and then said

25:19.840 --> 25:21.040
oh, we are in Boston

25:21.040 --> 25:22.440
the progress of reproductive medicine

25:22.440 --> 25:24.400
is suddenly a big mistake

25:24.400 --> 25:25.080
that these twins

25:25.080 --> 25:26.880
some of the artificial

25:26.880 --> 25:28.080
results

25:28.080 --> 25:29.160
and then

25:29.160 --> 25:30.360
so our search

25:30.360 --> 25:32.200
is to be in the twins

25:32.200 --> 25:33.400
three years old, four years old, five years old

25:33.400 --> 25:34.240
before and after the birthday

25:34.240 --> 25:35.440
and then invite them to the lab

25:35.440 --> 25:36.480
to do the experiment

25:36.480 --> 25:37.320
that the experiment process

25:37.320 --> 25:39.120
about three to four hours

25:39.120 --> 25:40.800
and then we collect a lot of data

25:40.800 --> 25:42.560
that is, including behavioral observation

25:42.560 --> 25:44.320
to some tasks

25:44.320 --> 25:45.400
and then or questionnaire

25:45.440 --> 25:46.520
that questionnaire will ask

25:46.520 --> 25:47.160
parents

25:47.160 --> 25:49.160
that is, the main caretaker fill out

25:49.160 --> 25:50.120
and then the test taker

25:50.120 --> 25:50.680
will follow

25:50.680 --> 25:52.120
the process of interacting with children

25:52.120 --> 25:53.360
to do some evaluation

25:54.280 --> 25:55.480
that measurement of the phenomenon

25:55.480 --> 25:56.320
we collect

25:56.320 --> 25:58.120
the cognitive function of the child's temperament

25:58.120 --> 25:59.480
learning performance

25:59.480 --> 26:00.560
cognitive function and learning performance

26:00.560 --> 26:03.240
there will be more detailed examples

26:03.240 --> 26:04.120
and then there are some

26:04.120 --> 26:05.280
behavioral problems

26:05.280 --> 26:06.800
such as internalizing problem

26:06.800 --> 26:08.600
or externalizing problem

26:08.600 --> 26:09.560
that it is a more

26:09.560 --> 26:11.280
psychopathology classification

26:11.280 --> 26:12.360
internalizing problem

26:12.360 --> 26:14.400
is more emotional

26:15.360 --> 26:16.000
you can imagine

26:16.000 --> 26:18.200
those problems that are deeper in the heart

26:18.200 --> 26:20.360
such as depression, anxiety, etc.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.760
externalizing problem

26:21.760 --> 26:22.880
is more on behavior

26:22.880 --> 26:23.720
can be observed

26:23.720 --> 26:24.240
such as

26:25.640 --> 26:26.400
antisocial behavior

26:26.400 --> 26:28.040
or attack behavior, etc.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.160
so we have this kind of data

26:30.160 --> 26:31.040
and then we also have

26:31.040 --> 26:31.840
the process of collecting parents

26:31.840 --> 26:33.920
interacting with children, etc.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.960
there are more than 300 variables in a year

26:35.960 --> 26:36.760
so my first year

26:36.760 --> 26:37.560
is probably to understand

26:37.560 --> 26:38.680
what is in the database

26:38.680 --> 26:39.960
but I think I have not yet

26:39.960 --> 26:40.680
fully understand

26:40.680 --> 26:42.600
what kind of data

26:42.600 --> 26:43.960
and then show you some

26:43.960 --> 26:44.920
photos of cute children

26:44.920 --> 26:46.520
when we collect the case

26:46.520 --> 26:47.440
when they are tested

26:47.440 --> 26:48.520
are separately tested

26:48.520 --> 26:49.720
so these are taken at the same time

26:49.720 --> 26:52.200
is the behind the scenes

26:52.200 --> 26:55.400
experiment outside the experiment

26:55.400 --> 26:57.240
and then the computer

26:57.240 --> 26:58.240
is to show you

26:58.240 --> 26:59.400
we have some tests

26:59.400 --> 27:01.440
are carried out on the computer

27:01.440 --> 27:02.480
and then if the child

27:02.480 --> 27:04.160
for sitting in the laboratory

27:04.160 --> 27:05.040
if you feel uncomfortable

27:05.040 --> 27:06.640
we will invite their parents

27:06.640 --> 27:08.000
is to sit in the room

27:08.000 --> 27:09.200
but is not to interfere with

27:09.200 --> 27:10.960
the child's task

27:10.960 --> 27:12.320
that is quite interesting

27:12.320 --> 27:13.480
here is the pool

27:13.480 --> 27:14.280
it is an observation

27:14.280 --> 27:15.880
of the child's temperament

27:15.880 --> 27:17.520
and then there is a story

27:17.520 --> 27:18.840
that is when I applied

27:18.840 --> 27:19.560
my boss told me

27:19.560 --> 27:21.400
I do not have to collect the case

27:21.400 --> 27:22.680
is to collect

27:22.680 --> 27:24.240
the analysis of the data

27:24.240 --> 27:25.480
and then want to see if I can accept

27:25.480 --> 27:26.320
because someone is

27:26.320 --> 27:27.920
must play with their own children

27:27.920 --> 27:29.080
and then I feel a little pity

27:29.080 --> 27:30.560
but I am not very persistent

27:30.560 --> 27:31.760
and then I went to the laboratory

27:31.760 --> 27:33.520
I saw the recording screen

27:33.520 --> 27:34.440
because we will first record

27:34.440 --> 27:35.960
and then the coding

27:35.960 --> 27:37.560
and then see a lot of children

27:37.560 --> 27:38.400
once put in the pool

27:38.400 --> 27:39.960
began to cry and scream

27:39.960 --> 27:40.720
I originally imagined

27:40.720 --> 27:42.320
the pool is a very happy

27:42.360 --> 27:42.840
environment

27:42.840 --> 27:44.120
children should be very happy

27:44.120 --> 27:44.880
but it seems that a lot of people

27:44.880 --> 27:47.160
is to be put into a unique space

27:47.160 --> 27:48.520
and then they feel very afraid

27:48.520 --> 27:49.840
so like this task

27:49.840 --> 27:50.720
we can observe

27:50.720 --> 27:51.960
the child's fearfulness

27:51.960 --> 27:53.560
or activity level

27:53.560 --> 27:54.280
like fearfulness

27:54.280 --> 27:55.720
is to cry and scream

27:55.720 --> 27:56.920
or not

27:56.920 --> 27:58.600
that activity level is also very interesting

27:58.600 --> 28:00.000
is their activity

28:00.000 --> 28:01.280
that we see some children

28:01.280 --> 28:02.480
is standing crying

28:02.480 --> 28:03.440
some will only play

28:03.440 --> 28:04.560
the ball on their feet

28:04.560 --> 28:05.840
some will run and jump

28:05.840 --> 28:06.600
and then fall

28:06.600 --> 28:07.120
and then stand up

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
continue to run and jump

28:08.120 --> 28:09.880
some will throw all the balls out

28:09.880 --> 28:11.720
and then the whole laboratory

28:11.720 --> 28:13.160
is full of their fearfulness

28:13.160 --> 28:14.200
so you can really see

28:14.200 --> 28:15.640
a lot of different changes

28:15.640 --> 28:16.640
children have different reactions

28:19.640 --> 28:20.400
so

28:20.400 --> 28:21.280
that is

28:21.280 --> 28:22.040
during the experiment

28:22.040 --> 28:24.000
we will not interfere with children

28:24.000 --> 28:25.280
how to play

28:25.280 --> 28:26.960
so they can even cry

28:26.960 --> 28:28.520
the experimenter can only endure

28:28.520 --> 28:29.560
and then scream

28:29.560 --> 28:31.280
endure that scream for three minutes

28:31.280 --> 28:32.360
so I feel

28:32.360 --> 28:33.160
too fortunate

28:33.160 --> 28:34.400
do not have to play by yourself

28:34.400 --> 28:35.080
but this child

28:35.080 --> 28:36.240
looks pretty happy

28:36.240 --> 28:37.520
it's great

28:37.520 --> 28:38.480
and then in the upper right corner

28:38.480 --> 28:39.400
this is our collection

28:39.400 --> 28:42.000
a task of parent-child interaction

28:42.000 --> 28:42.800
this toy is called

28:42.800 --> 28:43.640
Etch-a-Sketch

28:43.640 --> 28:44.320
and then I do not know

28:44.320 --> 28:45.440
if everyone has seen it in Taiwan

28:45.440 --> 28:47.320
I do not seem to have played

28:47.320 --> 28:48.640
it is a board

28:48.640 --> 28:49.920
and then there are two whirls

28:49.920 --> 28:51.280
and then one can be controlled up and down

28:51.280 --> 28:52.760
one can be controlled left and right

28:52.760 --> 28:53.200
and then

28:53.200 --> 28:54.480
we will give the children

28:54.480 --> 28:55.920
a few pictures with the parents

28:55.920 --> 28:56.800
and then they have to

28:56.800 --> 28:57.600
within five minutes

28:57.600 --> 28:59.040
the more pictures the better

28:59.040 --> 29:00.160
that in the process

29:00.160 --> 29:01.640
we can observe a lot of aspects

29:01.640 --> 29:02.480
like parents

29:02.480 --> 29:03.360
will be more authoritative

29:03.360 --> 29:04.320
to give instructions

29:04.320 --> 29:05.760
or more like a cooperation

29:05.760 --> 29:07.040
in helping children

29:07.040 --> 29:07.960
and then we can also see

29:07.960 --> 29:09.520
some of their physical interaction

29:09.520 --> 29:10.760
language communication

29:10.760 --> 29:11.920
or if the child

29:11.920 --> 29:12.520
today is not

29:12.520 --> 29:13.520
want to do this task

29:13.520 --> 29:14.680
parents will give what reaction

29:14.680 --> 29:15.760
and so on

29:15.760 --> 29:16.000
yes

29:16.000 --> 29:16.560
and then we

29:16.560 --> 29:17.320
the recipient is

29:17.320 --> 29:17.720
will be like this

29:17.720 --> 29:19.200
one by one to the lab

29:19.200 --> 29:20.640
is very cute

29:20.640 --> 29:21.520
do not have to collect their own people

29:21.520 --> 29:23.800
can say this kind of sarcastic

29:23.800 --> 29:24.440
and then

29:24.440 --> 29:25.320
then I will share

29:25.320 --> 29:27.360
my two analysis

29:27.360 --> 29:28.760
that the first one

29:28.760 --> 29:29.480
we looked at

29:29.480 --> 29:30.920
at the age of three

29:30.920 --> 29:32.760
the relationship between

29:32.760 --> 29:34.040
the child's temperament and school readiness

29:34.040 --> 29:35.160
how to be explained by

29:35.160 --> 29:36.960
genes and the environment

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
that we first talk about

29:39.000 --> 29:40.360
what is temperament

29:40.360 --> 29:40.800
temperament

29:40.800 --> 29:41.920
it is a child's temperament

29:41.920 --> 29:42.840
that it can be understood

29:42.840 --> 29:43.600
on the concept of

29:43.600 --> 29:45.360
the basis of personality

29:45.360 --> 29:46.560
the most widely known theory

29:46.560 --> 29:47.080
should be

29:47.080 --> 29:47.880
Chase and Thomas

29:47.880 --> 29:49.560
they divide the baby into

29:49.560 --> 29:50.240
easy baby

29:50.240 --> 29:51.000
difficult baby

29:51.000 --> 29:52.760
and slow to warm up

29:52.760 --> 29:53.880
and other

29:53.880 --> 29:54.880
and then they have

29:54.880 --> 29:56.640
developed more detailed

29:56.640 --> 29:57.240
classification

29:57.240 --> 29:57.960
such as

29:57.960 --> 29:59.480
the ability of the baby's self-adjustment

29:59.480 --> 30:00.920
the activity of the baby

30:00.920 --> 30:01.880
their emotional performance

30:01.880 --> 30:02.560
is high

30:02.560 --> 30:03.880
or relatively plain

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
or positive emotions

30:04.880 --> 30:05.240
more

30:05.240 --> 30:06.040
or negative emotions

30:06.040 --> 30:06.440
more

30:06.440 --> 30:06.640
like this

30:07.640 --> 30:08.120
in addition to

30:08.120 --> 30:08.800
Chase and Thomas

30:08.800 --> 30:09.560
theory

30:09.560 --> 30:10.680
there are other theories

30:10.680 --> 30:11.080
but

30:11.080 --> 30:11.880
behavioral genetics

30:11.880 --> 30:12.520
the interesting thing is

30:12.520 --> 30:12.880
found that

30:12.880 --> 30:14.440
no matter what classification

30:14.440 --> 30:15.040
we see

30:15.040 --> 30:15.680
the child's temperament

30:15.680 --> 30:16.480
has a very high

30:16.480 --> 30:17.520
heritability

30:17.520 --> 30:17.960
that is to say

30:17.960 --> 30:18.320
this thing

30:18.320 --> 30:18.760
is a bit like a

30:18.760 --> 30:19.400
metaphor

30:19.400 --> 30:20.160
genes can explain

30:20.160 --> 30:21.840
a lot of

30:21.840 --> 30:22.120
that

30:22.120 --> 30:23.000
in this study

30:23.000 --> 30:23.560
we use

30:23.560 --> 30:24.920
Methody's classification

30:24.920 --> 30:25.560
it looks at

30:25.560 --> 30:26.200
activity

30:26.200 --> 30:26.680
emotion

30:26.680 --> 30:28.320
and concentration

30:28.320 --> 30:28.720
and then

30:28.720 --> 30:29.240
in

30:29.240 --> 30:30.560
school readiness

30:30.560 --> 30:31.480
its concept

30:31.480 --> 30:31.760
is

30:31.760 --> 30:32.360
children

30:32.360 --> 30:33.000
how well prepared for

30:33.000 --> 30:34.520
going to school

30:34.520 --> 30:35.040
so it's actually

30:35.040 --> 30:36.080
a pretty broad concept

30:36.080 --> 30:36.320
like

30:36.320 --> 30:37.160
children's

30:37.160 --> 30:38.040
physical development

30:38.040 --> 30:38.280
because

30:38.280 --> 30:39.200
like some kindergartens

30:39.200 --> 30:39.760
they ask

30:39.760 --> 30:40.640
children to walk

30:40.640 --> 30:41.440
or eat by themselves

30:41.440 --> 30:42.480
to go

30:42.480 --> 30:42.680
then

30:42.680 --> 30:43.040
or

30:43.040 --> 30:44.360
children's emotional control

30:44.360 --> 30:45.160
this kind of

30:45.160 --> 30:46.280
development of ability

30:46.280 --> 30:46.640
that

30:46.640 --> 30:47.440
our study

30:47.440 --> 30:47.960
focus

30:47.960 --> 30:48.400
is more like

30:48.400 --> 30:49.440
academic performance

30:49.440 --> 30:49.640
then

30:49.640 --> 30:49.920
we use

30:49.920 --> 30:50.640
Bracken

30:50.640 --> 30:51.800
this measurement method

30:51.800 --> 30:52.360
includes

30:52.360 --> 30:52.960
them for

30:52.960 --> 30:53.640
shape

30:53.640 --> 30:54.240
number

30:54.240 --> 30:55.640
English alphabets

30:55.640 --> 30:56.320
color

30:56.320 --> 30:57.000
size

30:57.000 --> 30:57.240
this

30:57.240 --> 30:57.840
in kindergarten

30:57.840 --> 30:58.440
knowledge

30:58.440 --> 30:59.640
will be used in the environment

30:59.640 --> 31:00.600
look at their

31:00.600 --> 31:01.360
in such a test

31:01.360 --> 31:02.960
how high the score can be

31:02.960 --> 31:03.800
such

31:03.800 --> 31:04.280
good

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
Why do we want to

31:05.600 --> 31:06.520
put these two concepts

31:06.520 --> 31:07.720
connected together

31:07.720 --> 31:08.240
mainly because

31:08.240 --> 31:09.360
past research

31:09.360 --> 31:10.000
they found

31:10.000 --> 31:11.520
children's temperament when they were one year old

31:11.520 --> 31:12.400
can be predicted

31:12.400 --> 31:13.280
three or five years later

31:13.280 --> 31:14.320
school readiness

31:14.320 --> 31:14.560
so

31:14.560 --> 31:15.560
represent these two concepts

31:15.560 --> 31:17.280
there is some kind of relationship

31:17.280 --> 31:17.640
but

31:17.640 --> 31:18.600
this is not a

31:18.600 --> 31:19.840
behavioral genetics research

31:19.840 --> 31:20.240
so

31:20.240 --> 31:21.000
what exactly is

31:21.000 --> 31:21.840
what

31:21.840 --> 31:22.280
in

31:22.280 --> 31:22.800
control

31:22.800 --> 31:22.960
is

31:22.960 --> 31:23.240
genes

31:23.240 --> 31:23.800
or the environment

31:23.800 --> 31:24.120
control

31:24.120 --> 31:25.880
the relationship between these two concepts

31:25.880 --> 31:27.440
we are not very clear

31:27.440 --> 31:28.480
behavioral genetics

31:28.480 --> 31:29.000
we

31:29.000 --> 31:30.160
less research in this area

31:30.160 --> 31:30.400
then

31:30.400 --> 31:31.040
I found a

31:31.040 --> 31:31.720
closest

31:31.720 --> 31:32.200
is

31:32.200 --> 31:32.800
they look at

31:32.800 --> 31:33.480
concentration

31:33.480 --> 31:34.800
and academic performance

31:34.800 --> 31:35.040
in

31:35.040 --> 31:36.600
three or four years old

31:36.600 --> 31:37.200
and then they found

31:37.200 --> 31:37.720
mainly

31:37.720 --> 31:38.600
by genes

31:38.600 --> 31:40.040
to explain

31:40.040 --> 31:40.520
so

31:40.520 --> 31:40.880
this

31:40.880 --> 31:41.520
analysis of

31:41.520 --> 31:41.960
novelty

31:41.960 --> 31:42.680
is that we want to

31:42.680 --> 31:43.320
consider at the same time

31:43.320 --> 31:43.720
different

31:43.720 --> 31:44.400
child temperament

31:44.400 --> 31:45.360
and then see if

31:45.360 --> 31:46.280
this child temperament

31:46.280 --> 31:46.800
they

31:46.800 --> 31:47.640
with school readiness

31:47.640 --> 31:48.200
have

31:48.200 --> 31:48.960
the same genes

31:48.960 --> 31:49.640
in control

31:49.640 --> 31:50.360
or say

31:50.360 --> 31:50.880
is only

31:50.880 --> 31:51.480
concentration

31:51.480 --> 31:52.040
especially this

31:52.040 --> 31:53.160
child temperament

31:53.160 --> 31:53.560
is with

31:53.560 --> 31:54.200
school readiness

31:54.200 --> 31:55.080
related

31:55.080 --> 31:55.800
because everyone can imagine

31:55.800 --> 31:56.920
in the educational scene

31:56.920 --> 31:57.800
in the field

31:57.800 --> 31:58.560
does not seem to be

31:58.560 --> 31:59.240
you very focused

31:59.240 --> 31:59.760
sitting there

31:59.760 --> 32:01.200
you can learn a lot

32:01.200 --> 32:01.640
but

32:01.640 --> 32:02.000
your

32:02.000 --> 32:03.040
emotional connection

32:03.040 --> 32:03.640
to some

32:03.640 --> 32:05.040
other social cognitive functions

32:05.040 --> 32:06.080
may be affected

32:06.080 --> 32:06.600
or your

32:06.600 --> 32:07.240
intellectual development

32:07.240 --> 32:08.000
if today's children

32:08.000 --> 32:08.680
are surrounded together

32:08.680 --> 32:09.440
run around

32:09.440 --> 32:10.160
some things

32:10.160 --> 32:10.680
and then they can

32:10.680 --> 32:12.080
learn from the process

32:12.080 --> 32:12.880
but you just

32:12.880 --> 32:13.400
sit there

32:13.400 --> 32:14.320
very focused

32:14.320 --> 32:14.560
so

32:14.560 --> 32:15.160
it seems

32:15.160 --> 32:16.040
to learn from you

32:16.040 --> 32:16.920
is not necessarily

32:16.920 --> 32:18.200
a very stable

32:18.200 --> 32:18.960
truth

32:18.960 --> 32:19.360
development

32:19.360 --> 32:19.680
so

32:20.280 --> 32:20.840
good

32:20.840 --> 32:21.360
that

32:21.360 --> 32:22.200
before we put

32:22.200 --> 32:22.600
the data

32:22.600 --> 32:24.000
into the model

32:24.000 --> 32:24.280
just like

32:24.280 --> 32:25.200
just to talk about

32:25.200 --> 32:26.000
our analysis

32:26.000 --> 32:26.320
is

32:26.320 --> 32:28.040
the relationship between twins

32:28.040 --> 32:29.000
so we have to make sure

32:29.000 --> 32:30.240
the relationship is established

32:30.240 --> 32:30.800
and

32:30.800 --> 32:31.280
on the one hand

32:31.280 --> 32:32.000
is that we are discussing

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
individual differences

32:33.000 --> 32:33.880
we have to make sure

32:33.880 --> 32:34.680
there are enough

32:34.680 --> 32:35.680
individual differences

32:35.680 --> 32:36.240
we go to

32:36.240 --> 32:36.760
analyze that

32:36.760 --> 32:37.520
these individual differences

32:37.520 --> 32:38.400
because of the environment

32:38.400 --> 32:39.040
or genes

32:39.040 --> 32:39.640
more meaningful

32:40.640 --> 32:40.920
that

32:40.920 --> 32:41.560
picture

32:41.560 --> 32:42.280
you can see

32:42.280 --> 32:42.880
purple is

32:42.880 --> 32:43.800
same-sex twins

32:43.800 --> 32:44.800
and pink is

32:44.800 --> 32:45.960
same-sex twins

32:45.960 --> 32:46.680
that

32:46.680 --> 32:47.360
the picture on the left

32:47.360 --> 32:48.040
is talking about

32:48.040 --> 32:49.160
in each phenomenon

32:49.160 --> 32:50.640
the relationship between twins

32:50.640 --> 32:51.960
that is to say

32:51.960 --> 32:53.520
in the emotional aspect

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
same-sex twins

32:54.520 --> 32:55.280
their correlation

32:55.280 --> 32:55.840
and same-sex twins

32:55.840 --> 32:57.040
their correlation

32:57.040 --> 32:57.400
and

32:57.400 --> 32:58.040
task orientation

32:58.040 --> 32:59.200
refers to focus

32:59.200 --> 32:59.520
and

32:59.520 --> 33:00.120
score readiness

33:00.120 --> 33:00.400
that

33:00.400 --> 33:01.200
score readiness

33:02.080 --> 33:02.360
that

33:02.360 --> 33:03.000
picture on the right

33:03.000 --> 33:03.960
may be more interesting

33:03.960 --> 33:04.240
it

33:04.240 --> 33:05.160
we call it

33:05.160 --> 33:05.640
cross-chain

33:05.640 --> 33:07.080
cross-chain correlation

33:07.080 --> 33:07.880
it refers to

33:07.880 --> 33:08.280
we use

33:08.280 --> 33:08.840
twins

33:08.840 --> 33:10.160
one of the A-phenomenon

33:10.160 --> 33:10.920
to correlate

33:10.920 --> 33:11.880
another twin

33:11.880 --> 33:12.760
B-phenomenon

33:12.760 --> 33:13.440
then we go

33:13.440 --> 33:13.920
is to run

33:13.920 --> 33:15.200
related analysis

33:15.200 --> 33:15.840
that

33:15.840 --> 33:16.200
flesh and blood

33:16.200 --> 33:17.200
we can see

33:17.200 --> 33:18.000
same-sex twins

33:18.000 --> 33:18.560
compared to

33:18.560 --> 33:19.280
same-sex twins

33:19.280 --> 33:20.120
have a higher

33:20.120 --> 33:20.960
correlation

33:20.960 --> 33:21.200
so

33:21.200 --> 33:21.720
this can

33:21.720 --> 33:23.160
tell us very roughly

33:23.160 --> 33:23.640
genes

33:23.640 --> 33:24.160
in explaining

33:24.160 --> 33:25.080
these two concepts

33:25.080 --> 33:26.360
is a certain degree of

33:26.360 --> 33:26.800
impact

33:27.880 --> 33:28.080
that

33:28.080 --> 33:28.800
how much is specific

33:28.800 --> 33:29.480
we have to

33:29.680 --> 33:30.120
run a

33:30.120 --> 33:30.480
model

33:30.480 --> 33:31.160
to know

33:31.720 --> 33:32.080
then

33:32.720 --> 33:33.080
this

33:33.400 --> 33:33.720
then

33:33.720 --> 33:33.960
we

33:33.960 --> 33:34.280
fit

33:34.280 --> 33:34.640
is a

33:34.640 --> 33:35.400
biometric

33:35.400 --> 33:36.600
cholesky model

33:36.600 --> 33:36.840
then

33:36.840 --> 33:37.200
it is

33:37.200 --> 33:37.720
the general

33:37.720 --> 33:38.200
cholesky

33:38.200 --> 33:38.600
model

33:38.600 --> 33:39.320
inside the factor

33:39.320 --> 33:39.600
in

33:39.600 --> 33:40.200
further

33:40.200 --> 33:40.880
cut into

33:40.880 --> 33:41.640
genes

33:41.640 --> 33:42.400
shared environment

33:42.400 --> 33:42.680
and

33:42.680 --> 33:43.920
non-shared environment

33:43.920 --> 33:44.360
then

33:44.360 --> 33:45.240
it's a bit messy

33:45.240 --> 33:45.560
so I

33:45.560 --> 33:46.000
step by step

33:46.000 --> 33:46.600
to look at

33:46.600 --> 33:47.160
this model

33:47.960 --> 33:48.280
that

33:48.280 --> 33:48.600
is

33:48.600 --> 33:49.160
we have three

33:49.160 --> 33:49.640
phenomena

33:50.400 --> 33:51.000
then

33:51.000 --> 33:51.440
we use

33:51.440 --> 33:51.840
genes

33:51.840 --> 33:52.000
to

33:52.000 --> 33:52.600
explain

33:52.600 --> 33:53.120
this model

33:54.000 --> 33:54.720
first

33:54.720 --> 33:55.200
we first

33:55.200 --> 33:55.600
see

33:55.600 --> 33:55.880
here

33:55.880 --> 33:56.120
there is a

33:56.120 --> 33:56.560
A3

33:56.560 --> 33:57.320
factor

33:57.320 --> 33:57.680
it

33:57.680 --> 33:58.280
represents

33:58.280 --> 33:59.160
is to explain

33:59.200 --> 33:59.640
task

33:59.640 --> 34:00.320
orientation

34:00.320 --> 34:00.680
that is

34:00.680 --> 34:01.280
the focus

34:01.280 --> 34:01.520
of the

34:01.520 --> 34:01.800
child's

34:01.800 --> 34:02.240
temperament

34:02.240 --> 34:02.760
gene

34:03.280 --> 34:03.520
then

34:03.520 --> 34:03.760
we

34:03.760 --> 34:04.360
at the same time

34:04.360 --> 34:04.840
allow

34:04.840 --> 34:05.160
this

34:05.160 --> 34:05.560
change

34:05.560 --> 34:05.880
this

34:05.880 --> 34:06.560
factor

34:06.560 --> 34:07.440
to predict

34:07.440 --> 34:07.960
affect

34:07.960 --> 34:08.280
that is

34:08.280 --> 34:08.680
emotional

34:08.680 --> 34:08.800
this

34:08.800 --> 34:09.440
phenomenon

34:09.440 --> 34:09.680
with

34:09.680 --> 34:10.560
score readiness

34:11.600 --> 34:11.760
good

34:11.760 --> 34:12.200
that is to say

34:12.200 --> 34:12.560
if

34:12.560 --> 34:13.120
these three

34:13.120 --> 34:13.440
paths

34:13.440 --> 34:14.680
are shown

34:14.680 --> 34:15.120
A3

34:15.120 --> 34:15.320
this

34:15.320 --> 34:15.800
factor

34:15.800 --> 34:16.400
refers to

34:16.400 --> 34:16.880
these three

34:16.880 --> 34:17.520
phenomena

34:17.520 --> 34:18.280
underlying

34:18.280 --> 34:18.760
that

34:18.760 --> 34:19.160
common

34:19.160 --> 34:19.640
gene

34:19.640 --> 34:20.120
factor

want to change

36:35.680 --> 36:36.160
children's

no way

you want them

36:38.520 --> 36:39.160
to be the same

36:39.160 --> 36:39.440
is very

36:39.440 --> 36:40.000
difficult

36:40.240 --> 36:40.600
if you

36:40.600 --> 36:40.800
today

36:40.800 --> 36:41.240
to make children

36:41.240 --> 36:41.880
very focused

36:42.080 --> 36:42.480
that

36:42.480 --> 36:42.840

quite

36:43.120 --> 36:43.640
difficult

36:43.920 --> 36:44.360
but

36:44.360 --> 36:44.880
we can

family

36:46.480 --> 36:47.360
some factors

to children

36:50.080 --> 36:50.520
listen

they

36:50.920 --> 36:51.320
look

36:51.320 --> 36:51.600
look

36:51.600 --> 36:52.120

look

36:52.600 --> 36:53.240
Tienxianbaobao

36:53.240 --> 36:53.760

36:59.080 --> 36:59.720
let children's

36:59.720 --> 37:00.440
school readiness

37:00.440 --> 37:02.000
to move in the same direction

37:02.000 --> 37:02.640
may be able to

37:02.640 --> 37:03.400
improve their

37:03.400 --> 37:04.040
school readiness

37:04.040 --> 37:04.560
ability

37:05.000 --> 37:05.280
and

37:05.400 --> 37:06.120
this factor can

37:06.120 --> 37:06.600
explain the

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
variation is probably

37:07.600 --> 37:09.320
about 40%

37:09.840 --> 37:10.880
I want to square it

37:10.960 --> 37:11.920
about

37:12.840 --> 37:13.200
the rest of the

37:13.200 --> 37:14.000
good part

37:14.000 --> 37:14.320
is that

37:14.320 --> 37:15.120
can be shared

37:15.120 --> 37:15.560
environment

37:15.560 --> 37:16.400
so

37:16.480 --> 37:16.760
that is

37:16.760 --> 37:17.320
including some of

37:17.320 --> 37:17.520
us

37:17.520 --> 37:18.280
do not want to face

37:18.280 --> 37:18.640
the measurement

37:18.640 --> 37:19.080
error

37:19.240 --> 37:20.040
or say

37:20.200 --> 37:20.960
this may be

37:20.960 --> 37:21.400
because

37:21.760 --> 37:22.320
the same

37:22.320 --> 37:22.840
rater

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
in the evaluation

37:23.840 --> 37:24.280
of children's

37:24.280 --> 37:25.000
children's temperament

37:25.000 --> 37:25.680
so we see

37:25.680 --> 37:26.560
non-shared environment

37:26.560 --> 37:27.560
can explain

37:27.560 --> 37:28.080
the two

37:28.080 --> 37:29.640
covariance between the two

37:31.400 --> 37:31.680
good

37:32.680 --> 37:33.080
and then

37:33.080 --> 37:33.800
summarize

37:34.000 --> 37:34.760
so this analysis

37:34.760 --> 37:35.360
tells us

37:35.360 --> 37:35.800
we are in

37:35.800 --> 37:36.520
three years old

37:36.520 --> 37:37.160
to see

37:37.280 --> 37:37.960
child temperament

37:37.960 --> 37:38.920
with school readiness

37:38.920 --> 37:39.720
between the relevant

37:39.880 --> 37:40.400
are because

37:40.400 --> 37:41.600
the same gene

37:41.840 --> 37:43.080
behind the child

37:43.080 --> 37:43.560
temperament

37:43.560 --> 37:44.120
in the emotion

37:44.120 --> 37:44.760
this aspect

37:44.760 --> 37:45.480
is independent

37:45.480 --> 37:46.000
focus

37:46.000 --> 37:46.560
this aspect

37:46.560 --> 37:46.920
of the gene

37:47.200 --> 37:48.400
and the shared environment

37:48.680 --> 37:49.360
is only

37:49.360 --> 37:49.920
in

37:49.920 --> 37:50.560
school readiness

37:50.560 --> 37:50.840
above

37:50.840 --> 37:51.480
there is a significant

37:51.720 --> 37:52.160
impact

37:52.320 --> 37:52.840
so

37:53.480 --> 37:54.040
that we have to

37:54.040 --> 37:54.600
this analysis

37:54.600 --> 37:55.040
there is no

37:55.040 --> 37:55.320
what

37:55.320 --> 37:56.440
you want to ask

38:04.800 --> 38:05.800
the question

38:05.800 --> 38:06.240
of the host

38:06.240 --> 38:06.640
think

38:07.000 --> 38:07.240
OK

38:07.240 --> 38:08.240
very clear

38:08.240 --> 38:08.880
thank you

38:10.040 --> 38:10.320
good

38:10.320 --> 38:11.000
that I will

38:11.000 --> 38:11.920
move to

38:11.920 --> 38:12.760
the second analysis

38:12.760 --> 38:13.240
so

38:13.520 --> 38:13.800
that

38:14.160 --> 38:15.120
just a little bit about

38:15.120 --> 38:15.880
academic performance

38:15.880 --> 38:16.720
and cognitive functions

38:16.720 --> 38:17.520
are not the same

38:17.680 --> 38:18.080
so

38:18.080 --> 38:19.000
now this story

38:19.000 --> 38:19.480
will be more

38:19.480 --> 38:19.840
around

38:19.840 --> 38:21.200
the development of cognitive functions

38:21.320 --> 38:22.000
that we look at

38:22.000 --> 38:22.800
is three to five years old

38:22.800 --> 38:23.600
impulse control

38:24.560 --> 38:24.800
so

38:24.800 --> 38:25.360
impulse control

38:25.360 --> 38:25.880
is

38:25.880 --> 38:27.120
one of the cognitive functions

38:27.120 --> 38:27.360
so

38:27.640 --> 38:28.440
there is a background

38:28.440 --> 38:28.880
introduction

38:29.320 --> 38:29.920
impulse control

38:29.920 --> 38:30.680
he is talking about

38:30.680 --> 38:31.400
to adjust

38:31.400 --> 38:31.920
impulse

38:31.920 --> 38:32.200
with

38:32.200 --> 38:32.800
inhibits

38:32.800 --> 38:33.120
is also

38:33.120 --> 38:33.720
to suppress

38:33.720 --> 38:34.360
with the goal

38:34.360 --> 38:35.080
unrelated

38:35.080 --> 38:35.840
interference ability

38:36.160 --> 38:37.640
that in early childhood

38:37.920 --> 38:38.240
genes

38:38.240 --> 38:38.760
and the environment

38:38.760 --> 38:39.520
is how to explain

38:39.520 --> 38:40.400
impulse control

38:40.400 --> 38:40.920
we currently

38:40.920 --> 38:41.760
find the result

38:41.760 --> 38:42.040
a bit

38:42.040 --> 38:42.600
diverse

38:43.040 --> 38:43.520
such as

38:43.520 --> 38:44.280
our lab

38:44.280 --> 38:44.720
before

38:44.720 --> 38:45.120
for

38:45.400 --> 38:46.080
two or three years old

38:46.080 --> 38:46.880
child information

38:47.080 --> 38:47.480
with

38:47.480 --> 38:47.920
UW

38:47.920 --> 38:48.400
medicine

38:48.400 --> 38:48.800
there

38:48.800 --> 38:49.560
biopsy research

38:49.800 --> 38:50.640
have found

38:50.640 --> 38:51.280
the same

38:51.760 --> 38:52.280
result

38:52.280 --> 38:52.520
is

38:52.520 --> 38:53.200
quite strange

38:53.400 --> 38:54.200
when we use

38:54.200 --> 38:54.600
parents

38:54.600 --> 38:55.080
to assess

38:55.080 --> 38:55.720
impulse control

38:55.720 --> 38:56.760
to analyze

38:56.960 --> 38:57.280
in

38:57.280 --> 38:57.680
two years old

38:57.680 --> 38:58.280
and three years old

38:58.280 --> 38:59.120
we all see

38:59.760 --> 39:00.240
inhibits

39:00.240 --> 39:00.640
control

39:00.640 --> 39:01.320
can be

39:01.320 --> 39:02.360
explained by genes

39:03.160 --> 39:03.440
but

39:03.440 --> 39:04.000
when we use

39:04.000 --> 39:04.960
behavioral observation

39:04.960 --> 39:05.360
is

39:05.360 --> 39:05.680
there is a

39:05.680 --> 39:05.840
called

39:05.840 --> 39:06.080
lab

39:06.080 --> 39:06.400
tap

39:06.400 --> 39:07.520
this way

39:07.680 --> 39:08.760
we only see

39:08.760 --> 39:09.160
genes

39:09.160 --> 39:09.760
can explain

39:09.760 --> 39:10.920
impulse control at two years old

39:10.920 --> 39:11.760
he has no way to explain

39:11.760 --> 39:13.000
impulse control at three years old

39:13.800 --> 39:14.080
yes

39:14.200 --> 39:14.440
that

39:14.440 --> 39:15.160
more strange

39:15.160 --> 39:15.680
is to say

39:17.200 --> 39:17.400
in

39:17.400 --> 39:17.840
nine years old

39:17.840 --> 39:18.600
child

39:18.600 --> 39:19.240
when we use

39:19.240 --> 39:19.920
another method

39:19.920 --> 39:20.600
is cognitive

39:20.600 --> 39:21.040
phase

39:21.040 --> 39:21.720
may be through some

39:21.720 --> 39:22.080
cognitive

39:22.080 --> 39:22.440
test

39:22.440 --> 39:23.320
cognitive task

39:23.320 --> 39:24.080
or computerized

39:24.080 --> 39:24.440
test

39:24.640 --> 39:25.240
to measure

39:25.240 --> 39:25.520
their

39:25.520 --> 39:25.960
inhibits

39:25.960 --> 39:26.360
control

39:26.560 --> 39:27.120
we found

39:27.240 --> 39:28.120
it can be

39:28.120 --> 39:29.160
explained by genes

39:29.360 --> 39:29.680
so

39:30.400 --> 39:31.520
this makes us feel

39:31.640 --> 39:32.000
with

39:32.000 --> 39:32.600
behavioral

39:32.960 --> 39:33.960
observation

39:33.960 --> 39:34.480
see

39:34.480 --> 39:35.040
no genes

39:35.040 --> 39:35.640
can explain

39:35.640 --> 39:36.520
impulse control at three years old

39:36.520 --> 39:37.200
a bit strange

39:37.200 --> 39:37.520
because

39:37.760 --> 39:38.360
although

39:38.360 --> 39:38.880
development

39:39.040 --> 39:39.440
is a

39:39.440 --> 39:40.400
dynamic process

39:40.400 --> 39:41.200
but you can not imagine

39:41.200 --> 39:41.520
genes

39:41.520 --> 39:42.400
will be open

39:42.400 --> 39:42.760
so he

39:42.760 --> 39:43.240
in the end is

39:43.480 --> 39:44.000
can explain

39:44.000 --> 39:44.800
or can not explain

39:45.120 --> 39:45.800
that our

39:45.800 --> 39:46.320
idea

39:46.320 --> 39:46.800
may be

39:46.800 --> 39:47.400
our idea

39:47.400 --> 39:47.840
is to say

39:48.160 --> 39:48.760
may be

39:48.760 --> 39:49.320
behavior

39:49.320 --> 39:50.000
observation

39:50.000 --> 39:50.320
a bit

39:50.480 --> 39:50.960
a bit

39:50.960 --> 39:51.520
limited

39:51.520 --> 39:52.000
like

39:52.480 --> 39:53.520
our

39:53.760 --> 39:54.560
test process

39:54.560 --> 39:55.080
is to measure

39:55.080 --> 39:55.640
children's

39:55.640 --> 39:56.000
delay

39:56.000 --> 39:56.840
gratification

39:57.160 --> 39:57.760
that

39:57.760 --> 39:58.080
task

39:58.080 --> 39:58.760
like we

39:58.760 --> 39:59.440
give children

39:59.880 --> 40:00.160
to see

40:00.160 --> 40:00.600
chocolate

40:00.600 --> 40:01.400
but they have to wait

40:01.400 --> 40:01.680
a certain

40:01.680 --> 40:02.160
second

40:02.160 --> 40:02.600
can eat

40:02.600 --> 40:03.080
chocolate

40:03.280 --> 40:03.600
so

40:03.720 --> 40:03.920
yes

40:03.920 --> 40:04.600
in the process of

40:04.600 --> 40:04.680
experiment

40:04.680 --> 40:05.040
we will feed

40:05.040 --> 40:05.280
children

40:05.280 --> 40:05.400
eat

40:05.400 --> 40:05.880
chocolate

40:06.120 --> 40:06.320
that

40:06.480 --> 40:07.120
this ability

40:07.120 --> 40:07.480
may be

40:07.480 --> 40:08.120
at three years old

40:08.120 --> 40:08.480
children

40:08.480 --> 40:08.920
have

40:08.920 --> 40:09.880
learned all

40:10.040 --> 40:10.320
that

40:10.440 --> 40:10.800
is

40:10.800 --> 40:11.200
this is a

40:11.200 --> 40:11.880
socialized

40:11.880 --> 40:12.360
process

40:12.360 --> 40:12.600
so

40:12.600 --> 40:13.120
the environment

40:13.120 --> 40:13.760
suppressed

40:13.760 --> 40:14.120
their

40:14.120 --> 40:14.560
inhibits

40:14.560 --> 40:15.000
control

40:15.440 --> 40:15.840
and then

40:15.840 --> 40:16.280
put them

40:16.280 --> 40:16.840
all

40:17.120 --> 40:17.600
described

40:17.600 --> 40:18.480
in the same way

40:18.760 --> 40:18.960
that

40:18.960 --> 40:19.400
this

40:19.600 --> 40:20.160
environment

40:20.400 --> 40:20.760
force

40:20.760 --> 40:21.160
will let

40:21.160 --> 40:21.520
genes

40:21.520 --> 40:21.960
no place

40:21.960 --> 40:22.520
to show

40:23.360 --> 40:23.680
so we

40:23.680 --> 40:24.080
want to say

40:24.080 --> 40:24.200
oh

40:24.200 --> 40:24.400
that

40:24.400 --> 40:24.720
or we

40:24.720 --> 40:25.160
use another

40:25.160 --> 40:25.520
way

40:25.520 --> 40:25.760
to measure

40:25.760 --> 40:26.160
children's

40:26.160 --> 40:26.480
impulse

40:26.480 --> 40:26.880
control

40:26.880 --> 40:27.200
good

40:27.760 --> 40:28.200
so

40:28.320 --> 40:28.800
in this

40:28.800 --> 40:29.200
analysis

40:29.200 --> 40:29.400
inside

40:29.400 --> 40:29.920
we use

40:29.920 --> 40:30.120
is

40:30.120 --> 40:30.520
Flanker

40:30.520 --> 40:30.920
task

40:30.920 --> 40:31.120
then

40:31.120 --> 40:31.440
it is

40:31.440 --> 40:31.640
from

40:31.640 --> 40:32.000
NIH

40:32.000 --> 40:32.440
toolbox

40:32.440 --> 40:32.720
inside

40:32.720 --> 40:33.040
a

40:33.040 --> 40:33.360
test

40:33.720 --> 40:33.920
that

40:33.920 --> 40:34.080
everyone

40:34.080 --> 40:34.680
may have done

40:34.680 --> 40:35.240
the adult version

40:35.240 --> 40:35.320
of

40:35.320 --> 40:35.680
Flanker

40:35.680 --> 40:36.000
task

40:36.160 --> 40:36.520
it is

40:36.520 --> 40:36.920
there will be

40:37.200 --> 40:37.600
different

40:37.600 --> 40:38.000
arrows

40:38.000 --> 40:38.280
pointing

40:38.280 --> 40:38.560
different

40:38.560 --> 40:38.960
ways

40:39.400 --> 40:39.680
different

40:39.680 --> 40:40.040
directions

40:40.320 --> 40:40.560
and then

40:40.560 --> 40:40.760
you have to

40:40.760 --> 40:41.160
observe

40:41.160 --> 40:41.960
the arrow in the middle

40:42.360 --> 40:42.560
that

40:42.560 --> 40:43.080
arrow in the middle

40:43.080 --> 40:43.320
sometimes

40:43.320 --> 40:43.600
will be with

40:43.600 --> 40:44.240
the direction

40:44.240 --> 40:45.520
of the opposite

40:45.520 --> 40:46.040
that you can not

40:46.040 --> 40:46.880
be next to the arrow

40:46.880 --> 40:47.400
confused

40:47.400 --> 40:47.880
like this

40:48.520 --> 40:48.800
good

40:48.800 --> 40:49.200
it is a

40:49.200 --> 40:49.680
quite classic

40:49.680 --> 40:50.080
measure

40:50.080 --> 40:50.720
executive

40:50.720 --> 40:51.200
function

40:51.200 --> 40:51.920
task

40:52.280 --> 40:52.680
that

40:52.680 --> 40:53.040
for

40:53.040 --> 40:53.560
children's

40:53.560 --> 40:53.840
task

40:53.840 --> 40:54.240
child's

40:54.240 --> 40:54.800
experiment

40:54.800 --> 40:55.040
we

40:55.040 --> 40:55.360
in order to

40:55.360 --> 40:56.160
let them focus

40:56.160 --> 40:56.520
we will

40:56.520 --> 40:57.200
the story

40:57.200 --> 40:57.560
package

40:57.560 --> 40:58.360
a little fun

40:58.360 --> 40:58.760
then we

40:58.760 --> 40:59.120
package

40:59.120 --> 40:59.640
the story is

40:59.880 --> 41:00.160
that we

41:00.160 --> 41:01.160
today to feed the fish

41:01.160 --> 41:01.600
so you have to

41:01.600 --> 41:01.840
look at

41:01.840 --> 41:02.360
the middle

41:02.360 --> 41:02.960
of this fish

41:02.960 --> 41:03.200
it is

41:03.200 --> 41:03.600
facing

41:03.600 --> 41:03.960
this

41:03.960 --> 41:04.200
or

41:04.200 --> 41:04.640
this

41:05.120 --> 41:05.320
that

41:05.320 --> 41:05.720
because they

41:05.720 --> 41:06.000
answer

41:06.000 --> 41:06.240
the way

41:06.240 --> 41:06.440
is to

41:06.440 --> 41:06.640
point

41:06.640 --> 41:06.960
screen

41:06.960 --> 41:07.280
is good

41:07.280 --> 41:07.720
so even

41:07.720 --> 41:08.240
the main part

41:08.240 --> 41:08.680
can still

41:08.680 --> 41:09.000
carry out

41:09.000 --> 41:09.680
this experiment

41:11.240 --> 41:11.760
and then

41:11.760 --> 41:11.960
we

41:11.960 --> 41:12.680
also look at

41:12.680 --> 41:13.360
related

41:13.480 --> 41:13.880
that everyone

41:13.880 --> 41:14.240
may be

41:14.240 --> 41:14.800
notice

41:15.040 --> 41:15.720
this analysis

41:15.720 --> 41:16.200
related

41:16.200 --> 41:16.800
with the previous

41:16.800 --> 41:17.160
analysis

41:17.160 --> 41:17.520
relative

41:17.520 --> 41:17.960
is

41:17.960 --> 41:18.360
compared to

41:18.520 --> 41:19.360
a lot of difference

41:19.720 --> 41:20.000
but

41:20.000 --> 41:20.520
they are still

41:20.520 --> 41:21.040
obvious

41:21.040 --> 41:21.840
so we can still

41:21.840 --> 41:22.920
follow-up analysis

41:24.000 --> 41:24.240
and then

41:24.240 --> 41:24.720
another point

41:24.720 --> 41:25.200
want to add

41:25.200 --> 41:25.560
is that we

41:25.560 --> 41:25.960
look here

41:25.960 --> 41:26.120
is the

41:26.120 --> 41:26.920
cross-age

41:26.920 --> 41:27.600
relationship

41:27.920 --> 41:28.240
is

41:28.520 --> 41:29.160
every age

41:29.640 --> 41:30.360
related

41:30.360 --> 41:30.560
with

41:30.560 --> 41:31.160
cross-age

41:31.160 --> 41:31.880
related

41:32.200 --> 41:32.400
that

41:32.400 --> 41:32.960
we use

41:32.960 --> 41:33.200
is

41:33.200 --> 41:33.440
rank

41:33.440 --> 41:33.880
order

41:33.880 --> 41:34.600
that ability

41:35.080 --> 41:35.360
multiply

41:35.360 --> 41:35.720
multiply

41:35.720 --> 41:36.040
is

41:36.040 --> 41:36.760
PR value

41:36.760 --> 41:37.320
so if

41:37.320 --> 41:38.000
three years old

41:38.000 --> 41:38.440
child's

41:38.440 --> 41:38.880
PR value

41:38.880 --> 41:39.480
is 95

41:39.760 --> 41:40.160
four years old

41:40.160 --> 41:40.760
is 95

41:40.960 --> 41:41.120
that

41:41.120 --> 41:41.440
the relationship

41:41.440 --> 41:42.120
will be very high

41:42.360 --> 41:42.680
and not

41:42.680 --> 41:43.520
use the original result

41:43.520 --> 41:43.840
because

41:44.160 --> 41:44.640
in theory

41:44.640 --> 41:45.080
this time

41:45.080 --> 41:45.720
their cognitive

41:45.720 --> 41:45.960
function

41:45.960 --> 41:46.560
should develop

41:46.560 --> 41:47.120
quickly

41:47.120 --> 41:47.480
so you

41:47.480 --> 41:47.960
three or four years old

41:47.960 --> 41:48.800
get the same score

41:48.800 --> 41:49.240
is not a

41:49.240 --> 41:49.560
very good

41:49.560 --> 41:49.880
phenomenon

41:51.080 --> 41:51.240
that

41:51.440 --> 41:52.120
here is not very

41:52.120 --> 41:52.360
high

41:52.360 --> 41:52.760
related

41:52.760 --> 41:53.720
to tell us that

41:53.920 --> 41:54.920
in this period of time

41:54.920 --> 41:55.240
they

41:55.240 --> 41:55.960
impulse control

41:55.960 --> 41:56.680
ability to develop

41:56.680 --> 41:57.520
in fact, there are many

41:57.520 --> 41:58.200
changes

41:58.440 --> 41:58.960
that may be

41:58.960 --> 41:59.400
at any time

41:59.400 --> 42:00.120
children suddenly

42:00.120 --> 42:00.880
become black horse

42:00.880 --> 42:01.400
and then become

42:01.400 --> 42:02.200
super focused

42:02.200 --> 42:02.640
and super

42:02.640 --> 42:02.920
can

42:02.920 --> 42:03.600
self-control

42:03.600 --> 42:03.920
like this

42:05.920 --> 42:06.280
and then

42:06.280 --> 42:07.040
we put the same

42:07.040 --> 42:07.440
data

42:07.440 --> 42:07.840
fit to

42:07.840 --> 42:08.240
model

42:08.640 --> 42:08.920
although

42:08.920 --> 42:09.440
here is also

42:09.440 --> 42:09.880
fit a

42:09.880 --> 42:10.360
Cholesky

42:10.360 --> 42:10.720
model

42:10.720 --> 42:11.120
but

42:11.120 --> 42:11.880
behavioral genetics

42:11.880 --> 42:12.120
or

42:12.120 --> 42:12.840
twin research

42:12.840 --> 42:13.360
is not only

42:13.360 --> 42:13.920
this model

42:13.920 --> 42:14.360
can be used

42:14.360 --> 42:15.040
this is more like

42:15.040 --> 42:16.000
the process of my practice

42:16.200 --> 42:16.480
but

42:16.480 --> 42:17.160
you can see

42:17.160 --> 42:17.880
that this model

42:17.880 --> 42:18.280
is actually in

42:18.280 --> 42:19.120
the development of research

42:19.120 --> 42:19.720
is quite

42:19.720 --> 42:21.280
a good model

42:21.280 --> 42:21.800
because

42:21.800 --> 42:22.240
like

42:22.240 --> 42:23.040
in the previous example

42:23.040 --> 42:23.720
it tells us

42:23.720 --> 42:25.000
how many factors

42:25.000 --> 42:26.400
between different concepts

42:26.400 --> 42:27.000
can be

42:27.320 --> 42:27.960
how many factors

42:27.960 --> 42:28.600
are overlapped

42:28.840 --> 42:29.080
that

42:29.080 --> 42:29.560
here, then

42:29.560 --> 42:30.320
it can tell us

42:30.320 --> 42:30.680
in

42:30.680 --> 42:32.280
different periods of development

42:32.640 --> 42:32.960
those

42:32.960 --> 42:33.880
stable

42:33.880 --> 42:34.320
with new

42:34.320 --> 42:35.600
added factors

42:35.600 --> 42:35.920
is

42:35.920 --> 42:36.560
stability

42:36.560 --> 42:37.200
and change

42:37.840 --> 42:38.520
can be how

42:38.520 --> 42:39.200
explained

42:39.200 --> 42:39.880
is how to be

42:39.880 --> 42:41.080
explained by genes and the environment

42:41.520 --> 42:41.800
that

42:41.800 --> 42:42.120
our

42:42.120 --> 42:42.400
best

42:42.400 --> 42:43.200
fitting model

42:43.200 --> 42:43.760
tells us

42:43.760 --> 42:44.040
the first

42:44.040 --> 42:44.480
most important

42:44.480 --> 42:44.720
is

42:44.960 --> 42:45.960
the shared environment

42:45.960 --> 42:47.120
does not show the impact

42:47.280 --> 42:47.640
but

42:47.640 --> 42:48.200
most of them

42:48.200 --> 42:48.440
are

42:48.440 --> 42:48.800
genes

42:49.360 --> 42:50.280
are explained by genes and

42:50.280 --> 42:51.720
non-shared environment

42:51.720 --> 42:51.960
that

42:52.360 --> 42:53.880
age to age

42:53.880 --> 42:54.920
stability

42:54.920 --> 42:55.200
is that

42:55.200 --> 42:55.720
these will

42:55.720 --> 42:56.440
cross

42:56.440 --> 42:57.240
different age

42:57.240 --> 42:57.600
paths

42:57.920 --> 42:58.440
are

42:58.760 --> 42:59.760
the effect of genes

43:00.320 --> 43:00.680
so

43:01.880 --> 43:02.640
why do we see

43:02.640 --> 43:04.000
stable development between ages

43:04.000 --> 43:04.960
are all because of genes

43:04.960 --> 43:06.000
is explained by genes

43:06.360 --> 43:06.600
that

43:06.800 --> 43:07.080
but

43:07.080 --> 43:08.000
those changes

43:08.000 --> 43:09.040
across ages

43:09.040 --> 43:09.520
is

43:09.840 --> 43:10.640
genes and

43:10.640 --> 43:11.560
non-shared environment

43:11.560 --> 43:11.920
together

43:11.920 --> 43:12.840
to create

43:13.640 --> 43:14.080
the effect

43:14.080 --> 43:14.600
like this

43:15.520 --> 43:15.800
good

43:16.320 --> 43:16.680
so

43:17.280 --> 43:18.600
you may be curious

43:18.600 --> 43:18.880
that

43:19.360 --> 43:20.800
these new genes

43:20.800 --> 43:21.760
represent what

43:21.760 --> 43:22.600
this may mean

43:22.600 --> 43:23.080
we are

43:23.400 --> 43:24.320
in the process of development

43:24.320 --> 43:24.560
like

43:24.760 --> 43:25.160
just

43:26.360 --> 43:26.560
right

43:26.560 --> 43:26.800
no

43:26.800 --> 43:27.120
good

43:27.120 --> 43:27.320
this

43:27.320 --> 43:27.920
we can see

43:27.920 --> 43:28.520
the brain

43:28.520 --> 43:29.320
or other

43:29.320 --> 43:30.160
physiological development

43:30.160 --> 43:30.320
that

43:30.320 --> 43:30.840
this is

43:30.840 --> 43:32.120
the place where DNA can perform

43:33.400 --> 43:33.720
then

43:33.880 --> 43:34.400
I put this

43:34.400 --> 43:34.840
model

43:34.840 --> 43:36.040
change a way to perform

43:36.040 --> 43:36.720
is to put those

43:36.720 --> 43:37.880
factors

43:37.880 --> 43:38.440
into

43:39.640 --> 43:40.240
the model

43:40.440 --> 43:40.680
and then

43:40.680 --> 43:41.600
here want to see is

43:41.720 --> 43:42.800
in every age

43:43.160 --> 43:43.600
between

43:43.800 --> 43:44.760
in every age

43:44.760 --> 43:45.400
we see the

43:45.400 --> 43:45.960
variance

43:46.200 --> 43:47.320
how much can be

43:47.320 --> 43:49.760
explained by genes or non-shared environment

43:50.960 --> 43:51.120
that

43:51.600 --> 43:52.400
we can pay attention to is

43:52.520 --> 43:53.240
every age

43:53.520 --> 43:53.840
of

43:54.240 --> 43:55.320
mutations are different

43:55.320 --> 43:55.520
and then

43:55.520 --> 43:56.480
we draw here is the percentage

43:56.600 --> 43:57.440
so interesting is

43:57.440 --> 43:58.880
although mutations themselves are different

43:59.120 --> 44:00.680
but genes can explain the proportion

44:00.680 --> 44:01.880
is quite stable

44:01.880 --> 44:02.080
that

44:02.240 --> 44:03.320
is 35%

44:03.320 --> 44:04.200
36%

44:04.400 --> 44:04.640
that

44:04.760 --> 44:05.640
this is the proportion

44:05.640 --> 44:06.560
we just mentioned

44:06.560 --> 44:07.320
heritability

44:07.320 --> 44:08.400
is genes can explain

44:08.520 --> 44:09.680
what percentage of mutations

44:09.680 --> 44:09.880
that

44:10.640 --> 44:12.240
if we look more carefully

44:12.600 --> 44:13.480
we can see

44:13.760 --> 44:15.360
at the age of four

44:15.560 --> 44:16.080
most of the

44:16.080 --> 44:16.800
heritability

44:16.800 --> 44:18.400
is explained by the genes

44:18.400 --> 44:19.760
of the new performance at the age of four

44:19.760 --> 44:21.360
about 80% of these

44:21.360 --> 44:22.280
heritability

44:22.800 --> 44:24.400
but at the age of five

44:24.600 --> 44:25.680
the new genes

44:25.680 --> 44:26.520
only show

44:26.520 --> 44:27.520
50% of the

44:27.520 --> 44:28.280
heritability

44:28.280 --> 44:29.200
and the rest is

44:29.400 --> 44:30.680
in the previous age

44:30.800 --> 44:32.720
the effect of those genes that have been left behind

44:34.000 --> 44:34.480
so this

44:34.880 --> 44:35.640
result tells us

44:35.640 --> 44:36.200
is the longest

44:36.200 --> 44:36.840
highest number of

44:36.840 --> 44:37.080
people

44:37.080 --> 44:37.880
still worth it

44:37.880 --> 44:38.920
it can tell us some

44:38.920 --> 44:40.000
more interesting

44:40.000 --> 44:41.320
genes

44:41.320 --> 44:42.520
in the process of development

44:42.520 --> 44:43.600
is how to change

44:43.600 --> 44:44.120
this

44:44.440 --> 44:44.800
good

44:44.920 --> 44:45.320
that

44:45.320 --> 44:45.840
the same

44:45.840 --> 44:47.080
small summary

44:47.240 --> 44:48.320
so we see

44:48.320 --> 44:49.000
three to five years old

44:49.000 --> 44:50.480
the stability of the age range

44:50.480 --> 44:52.360
is all explained by the genes

44:52.520 --> 44:54.000
but the change in the age range

44:54.000 --> 44:57.080
is explained by the genes and non-shared environment

44:57.080 --> 44:57.600
and

44:57.600 --> 44:58.480
the shared environment

44:58.480 --> 44:59.240
no way

44:59.280 --> 45:00.240
to impulse control

45:00.240 --> 45:01.520
has a significant impact

45:02.400 --> 45:03.000
and I remember

45:03.000 --> 45:03.840
I last summer

45:03.840 --> 45:04.760
with my university teacher

45:04.760 --> 45:05.360
Mr. Wu Wen-Chi

45:05.360 --> 45:06.200
share this result

45:06.200 --> 45:06.880
is that he is a pair of

45:06.880 --> 45:07.520
dragon and phoenix

45:07.520 --> 45:08.040
and then at that time

45:08.040 --> 45:08.560
four or five years old

45:08.800 --> 45:09.320
and I said

45:09.320 --> 45:10.120
surprised

45:10.120 --> 45:11.800
parents can not use the same way

45:11.800 --> 45:13.560
to improve the ability of children to impulse control

45:13.920 --> 45:14.480
and then he

45:14.480 --> 45:15.200
laughed for a moment

45:15.480 --> 45:16.200
do not need to do the experiment

45:16.200 --> 45:17.000
I knew

45:17.000 --> 45:17.640
because the children

45:17.640 --> 45:18.680
do not care what you are doing

45:18.920 --> 45:19.440
and I feel

45:19.880 --> 45:21.720
so strong sense of helplessness and helplessness

45:21.720 --> 45:23.320
is really quite hard parents

45:24.680 --> 45:25.040
OK

45:25.600 --> 45:26.480
here to stop

45:26.480 --> 45:27.200
good for

45:27.200 --> 45:28.080
these two analysis

45:28.080 --> 45:28.600
have what

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
you want to ask the question

45:33.720 --> 45:34.920
I want to ask

45:34.920 --> 45:35.640
is

45:37.840 --> 45:38.480
Although

45:38.480 --> 45:39.560
because the environment

45:39.560 --> 45:40.800
between the twins

45:40.800 --> 45:41.720
is the same

45:41.720 --> 45:42.400
but

45:42.400 --> 45:44.240
every pair of twins

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
is the difference between

45:45.920 --> 45:47.040
their social

45:47.040 --> 45:47.640
economic

45:47.640 --> 45:48.040
rank

45:48.440 --> 45:50.120
will not affect them

45:53.040 --> 45:53.760
I think

45:53.760 --> 45:55.320
social economic status

45:55.440 --> 45:57.000
so that is the family

45:57.760 --> 45:58.600
family shared

45:58.600 --> 46:00.000
those environmental factors

46:00.000 --> 46:00.480
is it

46:00.720 --> 46:01.760
right

46:01.880 --> 46:02.320
because

46:02.320 --> 46:03.720
it will be calculated to

46:03.720 --> 46:04.760
the shared environment

46:04.760 --> 46:06.160
you say in the impulse control

46:06.200 --> 46:07.680
will not affect the shared environment

46:08.520 --> 46:09.840
because I found that

46:09.840 --> 46:10.360
there is no

46:11.360 --> 46:12.800
I'm just curious to say

46:13.040 --> 46:14.160
in fact, not in this

46:14.160 --> 46:15.120
this comparison

46:15.360 --> 46:16.120
but to say

46:17.000 --> 46:18.360
in your observation

46:19.000 --> 46:20.320
different pairs of twins

46:20.600 --> 46:21.520
social economic

46:21.760 --> 46:23.040
situation

46:23.040 --> 46:23.960
will affect

46:24.360 --> 46:25.680
their child's

46:26.320 --> 46:27.280
impulse control

46:29.880 --> 46:31.400
I do not seem to

46:31.560 --> 46:33.120
particularly in this direction

46:33.120 --> 46:34.520
development

46:35.200 --> 46:35.720
discovery

46:36.240 --> 46:36.840
Yeah

46:40.160 --> 46:40.920
I think

46:40.920 --> 46:42.320
in the impulsive control

46:42.320 --> 46:43.400
or child development

46:43.400 --> 46:44.920
in most cases, they will focus on

46:45.160 --> 46:47.000
the education of the mother

46:47.080 --> 46:48.280
is a lot of information

46:48.640 --> 46:48.780
it is now

46:48.780 --> 46:49.680
on this

46:49.760 --> 46:50.040
but

46:50.040 --> 46:50.560
is most of the mother

46:50.560 --> 46:50.880
education

46:50.880 --> 46:51.320
will be called

46:51.320 --> 46:51.440
social

46:51.440 --> 46:52.720
economic status

46:52.880 --> 46:53.760
parel

46:53.760 --> 46:54.240
but that

46:54.240 --> 46:54.880
is not

46:54.920 --> 46:58.440
the idea of ​​the whole big

46:58.440 --> 46:59.360
SES generalization

47:02.920 --> 47:03.440
there is

47:03.560 --> 47:03.840
a

47:04.400 --> 47:04.880
sort

47:05.240 --> 47:05.680
have

47:05.800 --> 47:06.040
it

47:06.040 --> 47:06.760
I want to add just

47:06.760 --> 47:07.160
Tsinghua

47:07.600 --> 47:08.240
Tsinghua teacher

47:08.480 --> 47:09.280
of the problem

47:09.600 --> 47:10.000
so in fact

47:10.000 --> 47:10.560
because you just

47:10.560 --> 47:11.320
in fact, have mentioned that

47:11.320 --> 47:12.040
you Boston

47:12.040 --> 47:12.440
this

47:12.440 --> 47:13.240
this study

47:13.600 --> 47:14.560
is most of

47:14.600 --> 47:15.960
the medical center of

47:16.120 --> 47:16.840
medical promotion so I can imagine

47:16.840 --> 47:17.640
in fact, your whole

47:18.200 --> 47:18.720
I do not know

47:18.720 --> 47:19.560
is not the fact

47:19.840 --> 47:20.680
but I feel

47:20.680 --> 47:21.720
your whole sample size

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
sample should be

47:22.720 --> 47:23.040
very

47:23.360 --> 47:24.160
very biased

47:24.160 --> 47:24.440
is

47:24.840 --> 47:25.240
I say so

47:25.240 --> 47:25.560
is not

47:25.680 --> 47:26.880
not to criticize your

47:27.280 --> 47:27.680
sample

47:27.680 --> 47:28.280
I mean

47:28.280 --> 47:28.760
so it sounds like

47:28.760 --> 47:29.600
your sample should

47:31.560 --> 47:31.760
not

47:31.760 --> 47:32.320
I just say

47:32.320 --> 47:32.880
I like to hear

47:32.880 --> 47:33.440
your sample

47:33.440 --> 47:33.840
is more

47:33.840 --> 47:34.680
higher

47:34.960 --> 47:35.800
knowledge level

47:35.800 --> 47:36.560
or high

47:36.840 --> 47:37.560
economic level

47:37.720 --> 47:38.040
and then

47:38.040 --> 47:38.840
is just mentioned

47:38.840 --> 47:39.400
you talk about that

47:39.400 --> 47:40.000
educational level

47:40.280 --> 47:41.000
in fact, I think

47:41.560 --> 47:41.960
this thing

47:41.960 --> 47:42.560
I think it is very interesting

47:42.560 --> 47:42.840
because

47:42.920 --> 47:43.400
I do not know

47:43.400 --> 47:43.840
you know

47:43.840 --> 47:44.160
that is

47:44.160 --> 47:45.520
they have to discuss

47:45.800 --> 47:46.440
all of the

47:46.440 --> 47:47.240
social economy

47:47.240 --> 47:47.960
of these

47:47.960 --> 47:48.520
social economic

47:49.120 --> 47:51.040
background

47:51.040 --> 47:52.680
these social economic

47:52.920 --> 47:54.080
it is actually a

47:54.080 --> 47:54.680
cluster

47:54.960 --> 47:55.720
that this cluster

47:55.720 --> 47:56.160
inside

47:56.360 --> 47:56.640
like

47:56.760 --> 47:57.000
it

47:57.400 --> 47:58.200
he thought

47:58.480 --> 47:59.000
that is

47:59.000 --> 47:59.920
formal education

47:59.920 --> 48:00.960
is inside the host

48:01.280 --> 48:01.600
that is

48:01.600 --> 48:02.200
this change

48:02.200 --> 48:02.600
it is actually

48:02.600 --> 48:03.960
all of the control of that

48:04.280 --> 48:05.160
your social and economic

48:05.360 --> 48:05.640
for example, say

48:05.640 --> 48:06.440
your education level

48:06.440 --> 48:06.960
higher

48:07.160 --> 48:07.680
your

48:07.680 --> 48:08.440
whole economic level

48:08.440 --> 48:09.120
you will be higher

48:09.120 --> 48:09.680
usually

48:09.680 --> 48:10.000
that is

48:10.000 --> 48:11.560
if it is a large sample

48:11.800 --> 48:13.040
it is such a phenomenon

48:13.240 --> 48:13.920
so I think

48:14.960 --> 48:15.360
that is

48:15.640 --> 48:16.320
to reflect back

48:16.320 --> 48:16.880
this question

48:16.880 --> 48:17.400
is to say

48:17.720 --> 48:18.520
this is actually

48:19.000 --> 48:20.160
in your observation

48:20.160 --> 48:20.840
will

48:20.840 --> 48:21.560
this thing

48:21.560 --> 48:22.120
is for you

48:22.120 --> 48:22.520
the whole

48:22.520 --> 48:23.440
discovery of research

48:23.440 --> 48:23.800
is

48:24.560 --> 48:24.920
there

48:24.920 --> 48:25.840
an alternative

48:25.840 --> 48:26.640
mechanism

48:28.520 --> 48:28.840
I do not know

48:28.840 --> 48:29.000
my

48:29.000 --> 48:29.240
yes

48:30.320 --> 48:31.040
I think

48:31.200 --> 48:32.200
pretty clear

48:32.440 --> 48:32.680
yes

48:32.680 --> 48:33.480
this is indeed

48:33.640 --> 48:34.000
our

48:34.000 --> 48:34.760
inside the sample

48:34.840 --> 48:35.360
is actually quite

48:35.360 --> 48:36.400
homogenous

48:36.600 --> 48:37.240
most

48:37.240 --> 48:37.760
are

48:37.760 --> 48:38.440
quite good

48:38.440 --> 48:39.200
education level

48:39.200 --> 48:39.440
and then

48:39.440 --> 48:39.960
because Boston

48:39.960 --> 48:40.960
is a lot of universities

48:40.960 --> 48:41.320
and then

48:41.560 --> 48:42.360
Boston population

48:42.360 --> 48:43.000
itself is

48:43.000 --> 48:43.800
mainly white people

48:43.800 --> 48:44.080
and then

48:44.080 --> 48:44.600
the proportion of black people

48:44.600 --> 48:45.120
is quite small

48:45.120 --> 48:45.600
Asians

48:45.600 --> 48:46.400
more than black people

48:46.600 --> 48:47.200
so this is a

48:47.200 --> 48:48.120
quite strange structure

48:48.320 --> 48:48.800
and then

48:49.600 --> 48:50.080
I only

48:50.080 --> 48:50.840
discussed with my boss

48:50.840 --> 48:51.400
this issue

48:51.400 --> 48:51.720
and then

48:51.960 --> 48:52.360
he

48:52.480 --> 48:53.480
gave me a

48:53.560 --> 48:54.600
get over it

48:54.760 --> 48:55.240
that

48:55.360 --> 48:56.000
explanation is

48:56.080 --> 48:56.760
we can say

48:56.760 --> 48:57.320
a bit like

48:57.320 --> 48:58.040
we are in the sample

48:58.040 --> 48:58.560
regress

48:58.560 --> 48:59.120
this

48:59.520 --> 49:00.000
impression

49:00.200 --> 49:00.520
but

49:00.600 --> 49:00.880
even if

49:00.880 --> 49:01.200
regress

49:01.200 --> 49:01.680
this impression

49:01.680 --> 49:02.520
we still have to see

49:02.680 --> 49:03.320
common

49:03.320 --> 49:03.800
those

49:04.040 --> 49:05.120
environmental factors

49:05.120 --> 49:05.840
that we can

49:06.040 --> 49:07.000
focus on

49:07.120 --> 49:07.480
if

49:07.480 --> 49:07.680
good

49:07.680 --> 49:08.080
we know

49:08.080 --> 49:08.840
is not SES

49:08.840 --> 49:09.800
that we can think about

49:09.800 --> 49:10.280
that other

49:10.280 --> 49:10.720
is what

49:10.720 --> 49:11.000
environmental

49:11.000 --> 49:11.560
common factors

49:11.560 --> 49:12.520
can explain this

49:12.760 --> 49:13.200
we find

49:13.200 --> 49:14.280
those factors

49:15.280 --> 49:15.520
right

49:16.520 --> 49:16.720
that

49:16.920 --> 49:17.200
is

49:17.200 --> 49:17.600
that the problem

49:17.600 --> 49:18.320
does exist in our

49:18.320 --> 49:18.800
sample

49:18.800 --> 49:19.120
that we

49:19.120 --> 49:20.320
think of another way

49:20.320 --> 49:20.640
to

49:21.040 --> 49:21.880
how to be more effective

49:21.880 --> 49:22.520
to use our

49:22.520 --> 49:22.960
data

49:22.960 --> 49:23.440
like this

49:27.080 --> 49:27.600
I also have

49:27.600 --> 49:28.280
understand

49:29.200 --> 49:29.720
I also have a

49:29.720 --> 49:30.720
curious question

49:30.720 --> 49:31.400
that is

49:31.560 --> 49:32.120
I am watching

49:32.120 --> 49:32.560
your

49:32.560 --> 49:32.800
this

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
research

49:33.920 --> 49:34.400
because its

49:34.400 --> 49:35.080
sample size

49:35.080 --> 49:35.720
is very large

49:36.120 --> 49:36.880
and

49:36.880 --> 49:37.360
its

49:37.640 --> 49:38.560
cross-age

49:38.560 --> 49:39.560
is several

49:39.800 --> 49:40.240
so

49:41.000 --> 49:41.440
your

49:41.440 --> 49:42.240
dropout rate

49:42.480 --> 49:43.560
is probably how high

49:43.760 --> 49:44.800
and I was thinking

49:44.800 --> 49:45.280
if

49:45.680 --> 49:46.720
very low

49:46.800 --> 49:47.280
is not

49:47.280 --> 49:47.920
related to

49:47.920 --> 49:48.240
just

49:48.240 --> 49:48.880
high-risk

49:48.880 --> 49:49.360
because you

49:49.360 --> 49:50.040
here

49:51.080 --> 49:52.040
is the participant

49:52.040 --> 49:53.280
it has a very special

49:53.280 --> 49:53.760
this

49:54.160 --> 49:54.520
high

49:54.520 --> 49:55.160
SES

49:55.160 --> 49:56.000
situation

49:56.360 --> 49:56.760
right

50:00.240 --> 50:00.520
right

50:00.520 --> 50:01.680
I

50:01.680 --> 50:02.400
must say

50:02.400 --> 50:02.920
I think

50:02.920 --> 50:03.800
300 pairs of twins

50:03.800 --> 50:04.480
is not a very large

50:04.480 --> 50:05.120
sample size

50:05.120 --> 50:05.360
is

50:05.360 --> 50:06.000
Robin Pullman

50:06.000 --> 50:07.480
he was invited to the UK

50:07.480 --> 50:08.200
they are doing

50:08.200 --> 50:09.560
more than 7,000 pairs of twins

50:09.560 --> 50:10.000
so I think

50:10.840 --> 50:11.320
can not be compared

50:11.520 --> 50:11.920
then

50:12.680 --> 50:13.440
our dropout rate

50:13.680 --> 50:15.120
in the first year is probably 10%

50:15.120 --> 50:16.000
the second year is probably

50:16.000 --> 50:17.320
12-13%

50:17.760 --> 50:18.120
or so

50:18.920 --> 50:19.320
so

50:20.360 --> 50:20.920
I think it is a

50:20.920 --> 50:22.240
state that can be accepted

50:22.240 --> 50:22.440
because

50:22.680 --> 50:23.120
mainly

50:23.280 --> 50:24.240
as we have talked about

50:24.240 --> 50:24.520
our

50:24.720 --> 50:26.120
twin study assumption is

50:26.320 --> 50:27.000
still twins

50:27.000 --> 50:28.240
is 50% of the gene

50:28.240 --> 50:29.200
that is on average

50:29.200 --> 50:29.400
so

50:29.600 --> 50:30.360
it will affect

50:30.360 --> 50:31.040
we have to have

50:31.200 --> 50:32.320
enough twins

50:32.320 --> 50:33.760
to do this assumption

50:33.760 --> 50:34.880
or there will be a lot of

50:34.880 --> 50:35.360
bias

50:36.520 --> 50:36.920
thank you

50:36.920 --> 50:37.120
thank you

50:37.120 --> 50:37.400
that

50:37.920 --> 50:38.280
is not possible

50:39.040 --> 50:39.680
I think

50:39.680 --> 50:40.480
in Boston

50:40.480 --> 50:41.240
the benefit of the case

50:41.240 --> 50:42.160
should indeed be

50:42.640 --> 50:44.720
parents will be more willing

50:45.320 --> 50:46.000
to contribute

50:46.000 --> 50:47.440
their children to the CNS

50:51.240 --> 50:52.760
there are other questions?

50:57.280 --> 50:58.240
Then I will jump to

50:58.240 --> 50:58.880
the last slide

50:59.080 --> 50:59.680
so it is

50:59.680 --> 51:00.920
a simple summary

51:01.400 --> 51:02.440
of the first behavior study

51:02.440 --> 51:02.960
it is a

51:02.960 --> 51:04.360
can be studied at the same time

51:04.600 --> 51:05.520
genes and environment

51:05.520 --> 51:06.080
how to affect

51:06.080 --> 51:07.760
an experiment method of individual behavior

51:08.280 --> 51:09.120
and then

51:10.080 --> 51:10.640
is

51:10.640 --> 51:11.440
to respond to

51:11.440 --> 51:13.040
the struggle between Socrates and Plato

51:13.280 --> 51:14.680
is in our human

51:14.680 --> 51:15.560
development process

51:15.720 --> 51:16.520
genes and the environment

51:16.520 --> 51:17.040
are at the same time

51:17.040 --> 51:18.000
have a significant impact

51:18.000 --> 51:18.480
like this

51:19.400 --> 51:19.600
and then

51:19.600 --> 51:20.120
then

51:20.120 --> 51:21.040
it is a bit of a response to

51:21.040 --> 51:21.400
the previous

51:21.400 --> 51:22.440
research by Robert Pullman

51:22.440 --> 51:23.240
is that children in

51:24.200 --> 51:25.080
the development process

51:25.080 --> 51:25.800
is not passive

51:25.800 --> 51:26.600
affected by the environment

51:26.600 --> 51:27.520
but children's genes

51:27.520 --> 51:28.120
will also actively

51:28.120 --> 51:29.320
interact with their environment

51:29.320 --> 51:29.880
is to produce

51:30.040 --> 51:30.560
and then

51:30.560 --> 51:31.080
it is

51:31.080 --> 51:31.680
we know

51:31.680 --> 51:32.720
genes and the environment

51:32.720 --> 51:33.960
have a significant impact

51:33.960 --> 51:34.800
on the development

51:34.800 --> 51:35.480
and this impact

51:35.480 --> 51:36.600
will change over time

51:37.280 --> 51:38.160
this is the above

51:38.520 --> 51:39.440
simple summary

51:39.440 --> 51:41.200
of what I have covered today

51:41.560 --> 51:42.160
and then

51:42.160 --> 51:42.760
here, then

51:42.760 --> 51:43.800
you can search

51:43.800 --> 51:44.920
is that it will connect to my

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Facebook Medium

51:45.920 --> 51:46.880
or Clubhouse

51:47.080 --> 51:47.560
and then

51:47.560 --> 51:48.080
Medium

51:48.080 --> 51:48.880
there are some

51:48.880 --> 51:49.360
that is

51:50.040 --> 51:51.200
in the United States

51:51.200 --> 51:51.760
some of the

51:51.760 --> 51:52.360
Dr.

51:52.360 --> 51:52.920
Murmur

51:52.920 --> 51:53.440
every month

51:53.440 --> 51:53.920
and then

51:53.920 --> 51:54.480
if you want to

51:54.480 --> 51:55.080
group up

51:55.080 --> 51:55.960
can read

51:56.240 --> 51:57.160
that if you want to

51:57.160 --> 51:57.760
save time

51:57.760 --> 51:58.280
I will

51:58.280 --> 51:59.240
put it in the description

51:59.280 --> 51:59.800
and then

51:59.800 --> 52:00.360
if you want to

52:00.360 --> 52:01.360
use the social process of the Provincial Office

52:01.360 --> 52:01.880
you can

52:01.880 --> 52:03.080
send it directly to my email

52:03.080 --> 52:04.000
I will also reply

52:04.000 --> 52:04.520
like this

52:06.440 --> 52:06.960
and then

52:06.960 --> 52:07.480
is

52:07.480 --> 52:08.480
Q&A time

52:08.480 --> 52:09.280
I hope everyone

52:09.280 --> 52:10.040
is not like this

52:10.040 --> 52:11.080
little friend so confused

52:11.080 --> 52:11.600
but

52:11.600 --> 52:12.360
very welcome

52:12.360 --> 52:13.480
all kinds of discussions

52:13.480 --> 52:14.000
like this

52:14.480 --> 52:15.600
then I will talk about it here today

52:15.600 --> 52:16.280
thank you all

52:19.080 --> 52:19.920
I think today

52:19.920 --> 52:20.840
is like a word

52:20.840 --> 52:21.600
learned a lot

52:21.600 --> 52:22.440
this is not a course

52:22.440 --> 52:23.040
because

52:23.040 --> 52:23.680
that is

52:24.320 --> 52:24.880
as a

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
developmental psychology

52:25.880 --> 52:26.640
PhD student

52:26.640 --> 52:27.120
is

52:27.440 --> 52:28.680
often in the course

52:29.080 --> 52:29.680
a lot of

52:29.680 --> 52:30.960
research on this

52:30.960 --> 52:31.760
but I think

52:31.760 --> 52:32.240
is

52:32.240 --> 52:32.760
a word

52:32.760 --> 52:33.560
that can be like

52:33.560 --> 52:34.520
I think there

52:34.520 --> 52:35.720
may be related areas

52:35.720 --> 52:36.840
may be different areas

52:36.840 --> 52:38.160
can be very clear

52:38.160 --> 52:38.680
put a

52:38.680 --> 52:39.960
I think it may be quite complicated

52:39.960 --> 52:40.640
that model

52:40.640 --> 52:41.080
with

52:41.080 --> 52:41.640
I

52:41.640 --> 52:42.520
although you just

52:42.520 --> 52:43.280
have very humble

52:43.280 --> 52:44.080
said more than 300 teams

52:44.080 --> 52:44.960
very little but

52:44.960 --> 52:45.480
I think

52:45.480 --> 52:46.280
300 teams

52:46.280 --> 52:47.080
quite a lot

52:47.080 --> 52:47.560
so

52:47.560 --> 52:48.120
I think I can put

52:48.120 --> 52:49.120
such a large-scale research

52:49.120 --> 52:49.920
so clearly

52:49.920 --> 52:50.360
I think

52:50.360 --> 52:51.680
is a very difficult thing

52:51.680 --> 52:52.320
and I think

52:52.320 --> 52:53.120
it is really clear

52:53.120 --> 52:53.800
and so interesting

52:53.800 --> 52:54.280
and

52:54.280 --> 52:55.480
the picture is so beautiful

52:55.480 --> 52:56.040
so

52:56.040 --> 52:57.240
now I will

52:57.280 --> 52:58.880
play this Q&A time

52:58.880 --> 52:59.360
so that

52:59.360 --> 53:00.320
everyone can

53:00.320 --> 53:01.520
freely discuss

53:01.520 --> 53:02.640
and ask questions

53:02.640 --> 53:03.000
that

53:03.000 --> 53:04.360
everyone is like just the same

53:04.360 --> 53:05.240
is that you can

53:05.240 --> 53:06.640
unmute your own

53:06.640 --> 53:06.960
that

53:06.960 --> 53:07.400
audio

53:07.400 --> 53:08.640
directly ask the question

53:09.120 --> 53:10.200
thank you Yizi

53:10.680 --> 53:11.560
thank you

53:18.600 --> 53:19.040
that

53:19.040 --> 53:20.440
Gao Xian to vote a question

53:21.280 --> 53:21.880
this is

53:22.760 --> 53:23.160
good

53:23.160 --> 53:24.440
this is actually my first

53:24.440 --> 53:25.320
model is

53:25.320 --> 53:26.400
particularly interested

53:26.400 --> 53:27.720
course the second is also very interesting

53:27.720 --> 53:28.080
because it is

53:28.080 --> 53:29.160
talking about stability

53:29.160 --> 53:29.680
but I think

53:29.680 --> 53:30.400
your first model

53:30.400 --> 53:30.720
is that

53:30.720 --> 53:31.440
in fact, you have talked about

53:31.440 --> 53:31.800
a

53:31.800 --> 53:32.320
conclusion

53:32.320 --> 53:32.960
you say

53:34.360 --> 53:34.800
that

53:34.800 --> 53:35.600
emotion

53:35.600 --> 53:35.800
that

53:35.800 --> 53:36.440
affect

53:36.440 --> 53:37.240
it to

53:37.240 --> 53:37.680
score

53:37.680 --> 53:38.400
readiness

53:38.400 --> 53:38.840
is

53:38.840 --> 53:40.040
no prediction effect

53:40.720 --> 53:41.440
but I

53:41.440 --> 53:42.000
look at

53:42.000 --> 53:42.880
your this

53:43.400 --> 53:44.240
what is this called

53:44.240 --> 53:44.800
trusty

53:44.800 --> 53:45.440
?

53:45.440 --> 53:45.640
the

53:45.640 --> 53:46.320
model

53:46.320 --> 53:47.080
you do not seem

53:48.360 --> 53:49.400
that you do not seem to use

53:49.400 --> 53:49.880
affect

53:49.880 --> 53:50.640
to predict

53:50.640 --> 53:51.000
score

53:51.000 --> 53:51.600
readiness

53:51.600 --> 53:51.840
you want

53:51.840 --> 53:52.200
because

53:52.200 --> 53:52.800
I put

53:52.800 --> 53:53.360
you this

53:53.360 --> 53:53.760
think of

53:53.760 --> 53:53.920
that

53:53.920 --> 53:54.280
structural

53:54.280 --> 53:54.640
equation

53:54.640 --> 53:54.680
of

53:54.680 --> 53:55.320
modeling

53:55.360 --> 53:56.120
that is behind

53:56.120 --> 53:56.480
those

53:56.480 --> 53:56.760
circles

53:56.760 --> 53:57.280
I treat it as

53:57.280 --> 53:57.600
random

53:57.600 --> 53:58.320
variable

53:58.320 --> 53:58.600
then I

53:58.600 --> 53:59.000
want to say

53:59.000 --> 53:59.320
your

53:59.320 --> 53:59.800
you do not seem to

53:59.800 --> 54:00.560
go to pull

54:00.560 --> 54:01.000
affect

54:01.000 --> 54:01.680
to predict

54:01.680 --> 54:02.000
score

54:02.000 --> 54:02.720
readiness

54:02.720 --> 54:03.200
and

54:03.200 --> 54:03.720
a little curious

54:03.720 --> 54:03.960
you this

54:03.960 --> 54:04.760
conclusion is

54:04.760 --> 54:06.000
how to come

54:06.000 --> 54:06.320
is

54:06.320 --> 54:06.720
I

54:06.720 --> 54:07.240
is not I

54:07.240 --> 54:07.640
for this

54:07.640 --> 54:07.880
model

54:07.880 --> 54:08.040
did not

54:08.040 --> 54:08.440
particularly

54:08.440 --> 54:08.840
did not

54:08.840 --> 54:09.240
understand

54:09.240 --> 54:09.720
clearly

54:10.480 --> 54:11.040
no no no

54:11.040 --> 54:11.720
I think you look very

54:11.720 --> 54:12.160
careful

54:12.160 --> 54:13.000
so you mean

54:13.000 --> 54:13.360
this

54:13.360 --> 54:13.680
path

54:13.680 --> 54:14.280
did not

54:14.280 --> 54:14.680
show

54:14.960 --> 54:15.200
did not

54:15.200 --> 54:15.960
be pulled up

54:18.480 --> 54:19.120
I can not see

54:19.120 --> 54:19.680
your arrow

54:19.680 --> 54:20.040
now

54:20.040 --> 54:20.520
can

54:21.000 --> 54:21.600
this is your

54:21.600 --> 54:22.120
affect

54:23.840 --> 54:24.200
so you

54:24.200 --> 54:24.680
must

54:24.680 --> 54:25.320
from A2

54:25.320 --> 54:25.720
to score

54:25.720 --> 54:26.280
readiness

54:26.280 --> 54:26.480
because I

54:26.480 --> 54:27.000
originally thought

54:27.000 --> 54:27.560
you said

54:27.560 --> 54:28.200
because your

54:28.200 --> 54:28.440
your

54:28.440 --> 54:28.800
following

54:28.800 --> 54:29.080
conclusion

54:29.080 --> 54:29.280
above

54:29.280 --> 54:29.600
is written

54:29.600 --> 54:29.760
that

54:29.760 --> 54:30.160
affect

54:30.160 --> 54:30.360
did not

54:30.360 --> 54:30.680
predict

54:30.680 --> 54:31.400
effect

54:31.400 --> 54:31.640
so I

54:31.640 --> 54:31.880
originally

54:31.880 --> 54:32.160
expected

54:32.160 --> 54:32.480
you should

54:32.480 --> 54:32.840
pull

54:32.840 --> 54:33.040
a

54:33.040 --> 54:33.560
affect

54:33.560 --> 54:34.000
to

54:35.960 --> 54:36.640
the second point

54:36.640 --> 54:36.960
affect

54:36.960 --> 54:37.440
does not

54:37.440 --> 54:38.320
unique

54:38.320 --> 54:39.080
contributed

54:39.080 --> 54:39.480
to

54:39.480 --> 54:39.760
score

54:39.760 --> 54:40.400
readiness

54:40.400 --> 54:40.600
so I

54:40.600 --> 54:40.840
originally

54:40.840 --> 54:41.120
expected

54:41.120 --> 54:41.360
you this

54:41.360 --> 54:41.640
sentence

54:41.640 --> 54:41.960
should be

54:41.960 --> 54:42.640
to say

54:42.640 --> 54:42.960
your

54:42.960 --> 54:43.360
affect

54:43.360 --> 54:43.720
to pull

54:43.720 --> 54:44.760
a line

54:44.760 --> 54:45.040
then

54:45.040 --> 54:45.200
to

54:45.200 --> 54:45.640
predict

54:45.640 --> 54:46.200
that

54:46.920 --> 54:47.200
score

54:47.200 --> 54:47.880
readiness

54:49.400 --> 54:49.760
I

54:49.760 --> 54:50.320
understand

54:50.800 --> 54:51.360
I think

54:51.360 --> 54:51.600
this

54:51.600 --> 54:51.960
model

54:51.960 --> 54:52.520
it is

54:52.520 --> 54:52.960
put

54:52.960 --> 54:53.680
three variables

54:54.640 --> 54:54.880
and then

54:54.880 --> 54:55.360
pull

54:55.360 --> 54:55.600
out

54:55.600 --> 54:56.080
up

54:56.080 --> 54:56.880
so it is

54:57.320 --> 54:57.800
not like

54:57.800 --> 54:58.280
SEM

54:58.280 --> 54:58.520
it is

54:58.520 --> 54:59.600
pull it up

54:59.600 --> 55:00.160
and then

55:00.520 --> 55:00.960
these

55:00.960 --> 55:01.400
factors

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
they are

55:02.400 --> 55:02.680
each other

55:02.680 --> 55:03.240
independent

55:03.240 --> 55:03.560
so it

55:03.560 --> 55:03.920
does not

55:03.920 --> 55:04.360
affect

55:04.360 --> 55:05.080
the path

55:05.520 --> 55:06.000
and

55:06.640 --> 55:06.960
it

55:06.960 --> 55:07.400
I

55:07.400 --> 55:08.120
I will write

55:08.120 --> 55:08.440
that

55:08.440 --> 55:09.040
affect

55:09.040 --> 55:09.640
it

55:09.640 --> 55:10.200
to

55:10.200 --> 55:10.480
score

55:10.480 --> 55:10.920
readiness

55:10.920 --> 55:11.640
no

55:11.640 --> 55:12.080
unique

55:12.080 --> 55:12.520
impact

55:12.520 --> 55:13.640
is because

55:14.320 --> 55:14.760
this

55:14.760 --> 55:15.040
path

55:15.040 --> 55:15.400
is not

55:15.400 --> 55:16.080
limited

55:16.080 --> 55:16.840
so

55:16.840 --> 55:17.640
independent

55:17.640 --> 55:18.200
score

55:18.920 --> 55:19.360
sorry

55:19.360 --> 55:19.760
independent

55:19.760 --> 55:20.040
task

55:20.040 --> 55:20.680
orientation

55:20.680 --> 55:21.000
and then

55:21.000 --> 55:21.640
only affect

55:21.640 --> 55:22.160
affect

55:22.160 --> 55:22.560
these

55:22.560 --> 55:23.320
genes

55:23.320 --> 55:23.800
it

55:23.800 --> 55:24.320
is not

55:24.320 --> 55:24.840
significantly

55:24.840 --> 55:25.320
affect

55:25.320 --> 55:25.560
score

55:25.560 --> 55:26.520
readiness

55:26.520 --> 55:27.160
so

55:27.160 --> 55:28.080
can explain

55:28.080 --> 55:28.480
affect

55:28.480 --> 55:28.840
and score

55:28.840 --> 55:29.240
readiness

55:29.240 --> 55:30.680
behind the same

55:30.680 --> 55:31.160
is

55:31.160 --> 55:31.760
through

55:31.760 --> 55:32.040
task

55:32.040 --> 55:32.640
orientation

55:32.640 --> 55:32.920
this

55:32.920 --> 55:33.640
gene

55:35.600 --> 55:35.880
so

55:35.880 --> 55:36.120
there

55:36.120 --> 55:36.840
is clear

55:40.240 --> 55:40.440
oh

55:40.440 --> 55:40.840
understand

55:40.840 --> 55:41.000
so

55:41.000 --> 55:41.560
you actually

55:41.560 --> 55:42.200
refer to

55:42.200 --> 55:42.600
special

55:42.600 --> 55:43.040
is

55:43.040 --> 55:43.520
gene

55:43.520 --> 55:44.040
performance

55:44.040 --> 55:44.200
ah

55:44.200 --> 55:44.800
gene

55:44.800 --> 55:45.920
part of the

55:45.920 --> 55:46.000
explanation

55:46.000 --> 55:46.520
is not actually

55:46.520 --> 55:46.800
the whole

55:46.800 --> 55:47.520
affect

55:47.520 --> 55:47.600
is

55:47.600 --> 55:47.800
this

55:47.800 --> 55:48.080
meaning

55:48.080 --> 55:48.360
right

55:48.360 --> 55:48.840
understand

55:48.840 --> 55:49.240
understand

55:54.320 --> 55:54.600
and then

55:54.600 --> 55:54.840
I

55:54.840 --> 55:55.360
also

55:55.360 --> 55:56.640
if you do not have

55:56.640 --> 55:57.640
a question

55:57.640 --> 55:59.120
then I will continue to ask you

55:59.120 --> 55:59.920
is that I am

55:59.920 --> 56:01.200
very interested

56:01.200 --> 56:01.680
in your first video

56:01.680 --> 56:02.760
or the next video

56:02.760 --> 56:03.240
is

56:03.240 --> 56:03.560
that

56:03.560 --> 56:04.080
I seem to see

56:04.080 --> 56:04.920
that you have a lot of

56:04.920 --> 56:05.200
BART

56:05.200 --> 56:05.840
and then go to see

56:05.840 --> 56:06.400
that gene

56:06.400 --> 56:07.000
explanation

56:07.000 --> 56:07.920
this thing

56:07.920 --> 56:08.400
and then

56:08.400 --> 56:09.120
is

56:09.120 --> 56:10.040
a twin

56:10.040 --> 56:10.360
ah

56:10.360 --> 56:10.760
this

56:10.760 --> 56:11.040
this

56:11.040 --> 56:11.800
that BART

56:11.800 --> 56:12.360
is not

56:12.360 --> 56:12.720
that

56:12.720 --> 56:13.560
um

56:13.560 --> 56:14.200
on another

56:14.200 --> 56:14.800
BART

56:14.800 --> 56:15.080
is

56:15.080 --> 56:15.800
related to

56:15.800 --> 56:16.360
that

56:16.360 --> 56:16.880
is

56:16.880 --> 56:17.640
to feel

56:17.640 --> 56:17.960
up

56:17.960 --> 56:18.400
I directly

56:18.400 --> 56:18.920
from that

56:18.920 --> 56:19.400
point of view

56:19.400 --> 56:19.920
feel

56:19.920 --> 56:20.400
right

56:20.400 --> 56:21.400
ah

56:21.400 --> 56:21.920
ah

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
temperament

56:22.960 --> 56:23.440
temperament

56:23.440 --> 56:23.760
I guess

56:23.760 --> 56:24.120
we are at an

56:24.120 --> 56:25.120
estimate

56:25.120 --> 56:25.560
right

56:25.560 --> 56:25.840
and then

56:25.840 --> 56:26.040
I

56:26.040 --> 56:26.240
from

56:26.240 --> 56:26.360
your

56:26.360 --> 56:26.760
another

56:26.760 --> 56:27.080
picture

56:27.080 --> 56:27.800
I feel

56:27.800 --> 56:28.480
is

56:28.480 --> 56:29.440
ah

56:29.440 --> 56:29.840
especially

56:29.840 --> 56:29.960
is

56:29.960 --> 56:30.400
AFET

56:30.400 --> 56:30.760
is

56:30.760 --> 56:31.320
there a

56:31.320 --> 56:32.600
special

56:32.600 --> 56:33.800
strong

56:33.800 --> 56:35.200
gene prediction effect

56:35.200 --> 56:35.560
compared to

56:35.560 --> 56:36.040
other

56:36.040 --> 56:37.000
like what

56:37.000 --> 56:37.480
ah

56:37.480 --> 56:38.120
text

56:38.120 --> 56:38.760
orientation

56:38.760 --> 56:39.080
I

56:39.080 --> 56:39.400
I guess

56:39.400 --> 56:40.560
this is actually

56:40.560 --> 56:41.120
inhibitory

56:41.120 --> 56:41.520
control

56:41.520 --> 56:42.280
of a kind

56:42.280 --> 56:42.680
I do not know

56:42.680 --> 56:43.600
I am

56:43.600 --> 56:44.880
not familiar with this

56:44.880 --> 56:45.280
so feel

56:45.280 --> 56:45.560
it seems

56:45.560 --> 56:45.880
should be

56:45.880 --> 56:47.120
self-regulation

56:47.120 --> 56:47.440
a

56:47.440 --> 56:48.280
phenomenon

56:48.280 --> 56:48.560
so I

56:48.560 --> 56:49.760
actually

56:49.760 --> 56:50.600
for

56:50.600 --> 56:51.080
this result

56:51.080 --> 56:51.600
quite

56:51.600 --> 56:52.120
curious

56:52.120 --> 56:52.840
why

56:52.840 --> 56:53.800
this self-regulation

56:53.800 --> 56:54.280
this text

56:54.280 --> 56:54.960
orientation

56:54.960 --> 56:55.960
it is actually

56:55.960 --> 56:57.560
no gene

56:57.560 --> 56:58.440
prediction effect

56:58.440 --> 56:58.760
ah

56:58.760 --> 57:00.160
no gene

57:00.160 --> 57:00.840
can explain

57:00.840 --> 57:01.240
because the place

57:01.240 --> 57:01.840
related to

57:01.840 --> 57:02.600
relatively low

57:02.600 --> 57:03.920
than AFET

57:03.920 --> 57:04.320
ah

57:04.320 --> 57:04.680
than

57:04.680 --> 57:04.920
prediction

57:04.920 --> 57:05.760
still low

57:05.760 --> 57:06.440
so I am quite curious

57:06.440 --> 57:06.800
that

57:06.800 --> 57:07.160
your

57:07.160 --> 57:07.680
explanation of

57:07.680 --> 57:08.640
that

57:08.640 --> 57:09.480
method

57:12.800 --> 57:13.520
I think this approach

57:13.520 --> 57:14.600
quite interesting

57:14.600 --> 57:15.160
well

57:15.160 --> 57:16.280
if AFET

57:16.280 --> 57:17.080
I just

57:17.080 --> 57:17.800
first thought

57:17.800 --> 57:18.800
is that it can actually

57:18.800 --> 57:19.240
from

57:19.240 --> 57:19.640
our

57:19.640 --> 57:19.840
ah

57:19.840 --> 57:20.480
blah blah blah

57:20.480 --> 57:22.280
we do not know how to see

57:22.280 --> 57:23.600
animation is really a bit of trouble

57:23.600 --> 57:23.960
is

57:23.960 --> 57:24.680
because you can

57:24.680 --> 57:25.280
indeed see

57:25.280 --> 57:25.840
it in addition to

57:25.840 --> 57:26.800
A3 this factor

57:26.800 --> 57:27.840
to explain AFET

57:27.840 --> 57:29.240
it has its own independent

57:29.240 --> 57:29.680
equivalent to

57:29.680 --> 57:30.880
it seems to have two

57:30.880 --> 57:31.760
genetic factors

57:31.760 --> 57:33.280
to explain AFET

57:33.280 --> 57:33.640
so

57:33.640 --> 57:34.440
I would think

57:34.440 --> 57:35.360
we see in AFET

57:35.360 --> 57:36.080
relatively high

57:36.080 --> 57:36.480
that

57:36.480 --> 57:37.160
heritability

57:37.160 --> 57:38.680
is quite reasonable

57:38.680 --> 57:39.360
but

57:39.360 --> 57:40.040
talk about

57:40.040 --> 57:40.480
why

57:40.480 --> 57:41.480
task orientation

57:41.480 --> 57:42.240
its

57:42.240 --> 57:42.840
ah

57:42.840 --> 57:43.720
gene

57:43.720 --> 57:44.600
ratio looks

57:44.600 --> 57:46.240
not very high

57:47.760 --> 57:48.560
I think

57:48.560 --> 57:49.520
this is very interesting

57:49.760 --> 57:51.040
I have not thought about this issue

57:51.720 --> 57:53.040
I want to plug in

57:53.040 --> 57:53.960
because you just talked about that

57:53.960 --> 57:54.680
Charles

57:54.680 --> 57:55.520
I will not read

57:55.520 --> 57:55.960
Charles

57:55.960 --> 57:56.920
Ferski

57:56.920 --> 57:58.160
of that model

57:59.200 --> 57:59.960
is good

57:59.960 --> 58:00.640
that model

58:00.640 --> 58:01.240
is

58:01.240 --> 58:02.000
you

58:02.000 --> 58:03.040
if you put that order

58:03.040 --> 58:03.720
transferred

58:03.720 --> 58:04.280
you put

58:04.280 --> 58:04.560
ah

58:04.560 --> 58:05.920
I can look at the next picture

58:05.920 --> 58:06.760
you put that

58:06.760 --> 58:07.360
task

58:07.360 --> 58:07.680
ah

58:07.680 --> 58:08.560
task orientation

58:08.560 --> 58:09.160
and AFET

58:09.160 --> 58:09.400
two

58:09.400 --> 58:10.320
contrast

58:10.320 --> 58:11.720
in fact, there will be similar things

58:11.720 --> 58:12.640
because it is actually

58:12.640 --> 58:13.280
put

58:13.280 --> 58:13.760
that

58:13.760 --> 58:14.400
for example, A3

58:14.400 --> 58:15.120
you can also put

58:15.120 --> 58:16.040
predict

58:16.040 --> 58:16.760
task

58:16.760 --> 58:17.320
AFET

58:17.320 --> 58:18.040
ah

58:18.040 --> 58:19.160
school readiness

58:19.160 --> 58:19.880
and A2

58:19.880 --> 58:21.120
only predict

58:21.120 --> 58:21.840
task

58:21.840 --> 58:22.920
orientation

58:22.920 --> 58:23.720
so it can actually

58:23.720 --> 58:25.240
it is just a partial out

58:25.240 --> 58:25.880
is to pull it

58:25.880 --> 58:27.680
FERS process only

58:27.680 --> 58:28.920
so in fact, I look back

58:28.920 --> 58:29.600
it seems

58:29.600 --> 58:30.800
I am still very confused

58:30.800 --> 58:31.560
why

58:31.560 --> 58:32.400
task orientation

58:32.400 --> 58:33.080
so

58:33.080 --> 58:33.760
I think

58:33.760 --> 58:34.920
it should be a pretty

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
gene

58:35.920 --> 58:36.560
thing

58:36.560 --> 58:37.400
is self-adjustment

58:37.400 --> 58:38.440
compared to AFET

58:38.440 --> 58:38.600
ah

58:38.600 --> 58:39.880
I do not dare to say

58:39.880 --> 58:40.480
I do not

58:40.480 --> 58:40.760
just

58:40.760 --> 58:41.320
in short, I think

58:41.320 --> 58:42.480
it should also have

58:42.480 --> 58:43.600
a lot of

58:43.600 --> 58:44.920
gene performance

58:44.920 --> 58:45.560
but from just

58:45.560 --> 58:46.280
your picture

58:46.280 --> 58:47.000
from your bar

58:47.000 --> 58:48.480
you can clearly see that

58:48.480 --> 58:49.400
it seems that the gene

58:49.400 --> 58:49.920
that performance

58:49.920 --> 58:51.360
is particularly low

58:51.360 --> 58:52.000
that I do not know

58:52.000 --> 58:52.440
is not because you

58:52.440 --> 58:53.120
now this child

58:53.120 --> 58:54.080
only three years old

58:54.080 --> 58:54.680
because the child

58:54.680 --> 58:56.320
is probably around two years old

58:56.320 --> 58:57.280
his

58:57.280 --> 58:58.640
self-regulation

58:58.640 --> 58:59.440
will be more

58:59.440 --> 59:00.640
formal

59:00.640 --> 59:01.480
I do not know if it is because of the dissection

59:01.480 --> 59:02.120
but I think

59:02.120 --> 59:02.400
three years old

59:02.400 --> 59:03.840
in fact, it should be quite complete

59:03.840 --> 59:04.400
but I think

59:04.400 --> 59:04.880
I do not know if it is because

59:04.880 --> 59:06.280
he is still relatively young

59:06.280 --> 59:07.080
so

59:07.080 --> 59:07.760
self-regulation

59:07.760 --> 59:08.640
has not been completely

59:08.640 --> 59:09.280
really

59:09.280 --> 59:10.360
good

59:10.360 --> 59:11.240
test

59:11.240 --> 59:11.880
and so on

59:11.880 --> 59:12.480
I do not know

59:12.480 --> 59:13.440
I do not know what your explanation

59:13.440 --> 59:14.040
will be

59:14.040 --> 59:14.560
well

59:16.200 --> 59:17.400
I think

59:17.400 --> 59:17.920
it is interesting

59:18.040 --> 59:19.680
I will answer it one by one

59:19.680 --> 59:20.560
I think the first question

59:20.560 --> 59:22.080
is a very expert question

59:22.080 --> 59:23.120
is about the model

59:23.120 --> 59:24.720
how to put those items

59:24.720 --> 59:25.120
indeed

59:25.120 --> 59:26.600
if you want to calculate some

59:26.600 --> 59:27.200
is that you finally

59:27.200 --> 59:28.800
pull out of the thing

59:28.800 --> 59:29.640
you do not care how to put

59:29.640 --> 59:30.480
calculated

59:30.480 --> 59:31.400
estimated heritability

59:31.400 --> 59:32.440
will be the same

59:32.440 --> 59:32.920
but

59:32.920 --> 59:33.840
we will put here

59:33.840 --> 59:34.480
the reason is because

59:34.480 --> 59:35.600
past research has known

59:35.600 --> 59:36.320
task orientation

59:36.320 --> 59:37.120
and score readiness

59:37.120 --> 59:38.360
are related

59:38.360 --> 59:39.000
so that

59:39.000 --> 59:40.080
it is actually not a

59:40.080 --> 59:41.400
particularly interesting phenomenon

59:41.400 --> 59:42.800
that we are interested in is

59:42.800 --> 59:44.480
affect and score readiness

59:44.480 --> 59:45.520
they will not actually have

59:45.520 --> 59:46.480
a unique

59:46.520 --> 59:47.400
score readiness

59:47.400 --> 59:48.280
related

59:48.280 --> 59:49.560
so we put it in the second

59:49.560 --> 59:50.240
that is to say

59:50.240 --> 59:51.000
if these two

59:51.000 --> 59:52.200
paths are obvious

59:52.200 --> 59:53.120
it can be said

59:53.120 --> 59:53.960
oh, we guessed

59:53.960 --> 59:54.680
that is right

59:54.680 --> 59:56.000
but we guessed wrong

59:56.000 --> 59:56.480
so

59:56.480 --> 59:57.480
its order

59:57.480 --> 59:58.520
can

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
reflect some of our

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.680
questions we want to ask

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.240
then

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.840
score readiness

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.560
put at the end

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.320
means

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.160
it actually

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.000
we want to see

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:05.600
unique

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
for score readiness

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.120
those effects

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:08.840
because we actually

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.480
really interesting

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:09.880
is not the

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.360
temperament

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:10.920
we are interested in

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.480
it

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.880
temperament

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.640
and score readiness

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.160
related

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.640
with

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.280
score readiness

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.680
itself

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:14.880
in the end

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.240
what

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:15.920
special

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.360
effect

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360
like this

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.640
so

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:18.920
that is

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.120
the order of the model

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120
will

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.680
affect

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.640
how we want

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.520
to be more

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.280
effective

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.000
and convenient

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.520
to explain this model

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.440
then

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.280
I think

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.240
that

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.640
question of heritability

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.680
can look at

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.320
this path

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.880
so we can see here

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.120
that is

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.600
this path

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.080
square

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:36.640
will be its

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.480
heritability

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:37.720
so

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.120
here

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.880
calculated

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.240
actually

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:39.960
gene can explain

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.840
about 40%

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840
variance

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.960
for

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960
task orientation

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:46.880
so

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.360
actually

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:47.880
not particularly

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.400
low

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:48.840
although

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.360
in the

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:49.880
bar graph

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.360
inside

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:50.920
does not look

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.440
high

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:51.920
but

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.440
it is actually

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:52.960
explained

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960
about 40%

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960
right

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.440
I'm here

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440
to interrupt

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440
as a host

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440
is

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440
the time factor

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440
because I think

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.440
there should be

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440
some later

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440
is

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.440
more detailed discussion

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440
that

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440
because I want to say

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440
that we are now

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440
recording

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440
that do not know

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440
if it can be a little bit

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440
interrupted discussion here

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440
and then I want

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440
as a host

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440
is to ask

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.520
that

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520
I do not know

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520
in today's

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520
speech

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520
is now here

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520
to a paragraph

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520
you have anything

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
that you know

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520
in addition to just

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520
the last slide

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
of take home

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520
message

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
you have anything

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.520
that is more personal

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.520
a few words of

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
personality

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.520
want to talk to

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.520
Project Tara

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520
for example,

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.520
after listening to

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520
the audience

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520
of this video

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.520
can share

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520
that

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520
may be

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520
after you say

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520
a few words

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.520
I will stop recording

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520
here first

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
and then with us

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
live

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.600
or future audience

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600
can share

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
some of you

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600
do this

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.600
very interesting research

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.600
and I think

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600
it is rare to study

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600
some of you know

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600
that is more personal

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.600
ideas

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600
or something

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600
I did not expect

01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600
this part

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600
but I think

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600
I want to say

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600
a lot of things

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600
are put in

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600
take home message

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.600
inside

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600
so everyone

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600
is if there are

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
other questions

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600
can write to contact me

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600
like this

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600
good

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600
that today is very grateful

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.600
for this

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680
official stop

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680
recording

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680
that should be

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680
here

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680
to continue with everyone

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680
to do some

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.680
discussion after the meeting

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680
that is

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680
as a host

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680
very, very grateful

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680
for today

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680
everyone is

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
such a wonderful speech

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680
that I officially stop

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680
recording
