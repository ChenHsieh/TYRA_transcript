17000	23000	His topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation Deep Penetration Problems.
23000	27000	Before we start, let me introduce our speaker today.
27000	29000	His name is Vince Mengren.
29000	39000	He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.
39000	42000	Let me introduce his background.
42000	49000	He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.
50000	59000	Before this, he got his PhD in Nuclear Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2019.
59000	65000	His main research interest is Particle Transport Simulation.
65000	67000	This is the topic he will talk about today.
67000	71000	There is another topic that is not today's topic, but it is very cool.
71000	76000	It is Robotic Arm Applications in Nuclear Industry.
76000	79000	Obviously, you can't do anything by yourself.
79000	81000	This is a very important application.
81000	85000	There is a very special thing.
85000	86000	This is our online speech.
86000	88000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome our speaker.
88000	92000	Please turn on the microphone so that our speaker can hear our applause.
92000	100000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome Vince to give us a wonderful speech today.
100000	101000	I'll leave it to you.
101000	103000	Thank you, Ian.
103000	107000	First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to my speech.
107000	112000	My topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation.
112000	116000	Basically, Particle Transport Simulation can be used in many ways.
116000	120000	My main focus today is Deep Penetration Problem.
120000	123000	I will introduce what Deep Penetration Problem is later.
123000	127000	In fact, this chart has already told you some information.
127000	132000	At first, I will talk about what Particle Transport is.
132000	135000	Why do we need Particle Transport?
135000	140000	Second, what are the main applications?
140000	143000	I just said that Particle Transport has many applications.
143000	146000	If I have to talk about everything, I won't be able to finish it in an hour.
146000	148000	So I'm focusing on Deep Penetration Problem today.
148000	150000	It's actually a shielding problem.
150000	155000	Basically, you need to have a method to do this simulation.
155000	157000	There is a Governing Equation behind it.
157000	161000	Then you have to develop some methods to solve it.
161000	164000	I will talk about what the mainstream methods are now.
164000	166000	What are their advantages and disadvantages?
166000	168000	What are some more advanced methods?
168000	171000	Basically, I'm talking about Variance Reduction Techniques here.
171000	175000	Finally, of course, I will give a Demonstration Problem.
175000	177000	Finally, there is a Summary.
177000	183000	Before we solve any problem,
183000	186000	we have to talk about the Governing Equation behind it.
186000	192000	The Governing Equation behind Particle Transport is the Boltzmann Transport Equation.
192000	196000	You can see that the above equation looks very complicated.
196000	198000	This is General Form.
198000	200000	You have Time Dependent Terms.
200000	203000	We talk about Particle Streaming.
203000	206000	Your particle will be in Boundary Loss.
206000	208000	Then you may have an extra position.
208000	212000	For example, if you are an electrolyte, you may have magnetic force.
213000	216000	Gravity is generally not considered.
216000	218000	Because the particle is very small.
218000	220000	Then you have Collision.
220000	223000	The right side is basically Particle Gain.
223000	228000	When we calculate the Particle Transport,
228000	231000	We will talk about whether it is Lost or Gain.
231000	233000	You can see that the left side is basically Lost.
233000	234000	The right side is Gain.
234000	239000	I won't focus too much on Mathematics.
239000	243000	Because if you are not doing this field,
243000	246000	Mathematics will take a long time to understand.
246000	250000	The above is General Form.
250000	252000	The following is basically
252000	258000	If you need to do radiation transfer calculation.
258000	260000	Calculate their mass.
260000	262000	This is the Governing Equation we usually use.
262000	264000	This is from the above equation.
264000	268000	We talk about Steady State and Linear Boltzmann Equation.
268000	271000	You can see that there is a word called Linear here.
271000	273000	Steady State should not need to explain, everyone knows.
273000	276000	Basically, what we mean by Linear here is
276000	280000	For example, if you want to calculate the mass today.
280000	283000	For example, I am Photon today.
283000	285000	Photon will cause mass to me.
285000	289000	Today I assume that there will be no effect between Photon and Photon.
289000	291000	So this Linear is from here.
291000	293000	So you can see here
293000	295000	Basically, it only looks like once.
295000	300000	This is the function we want to solve.
300000	303000	We call it Flux.
303000	305000	Basically, you can see that the above and below
305000	308000	These two equations actually look a bit like.
308000	310000	The only difference is that one is General Form.
310000	314000	The other is Specifically.
314000	317000	We are not too independent and it is Linear.
317000	327000	We can explain a little bit about what this equation is doing.
327000	329000	Just use this example.
329000	331000	This example is basically if you go to the hospital.
331000	334000	You often see these X-ray machines.
334000	338000	This X-ray machine basically has a radiation source inside.
338000	340000	The middle one is inside.
340000	344000	Basically, a general X-ray machine is a beam of light.
345000	349000	Basically, you can circle a boundary.
349000	354000	If this beam of light runs out of this system.
354000	356000	I don't think about it.
356000	358000	Because it basically won't come back.
358000	360000	Basically, my patient may be here.
360000	363000	You basically have to estimate the number of patients.
363000	366000	The beam of light that goes out here.
366000	368000	I just talked about streaming.
368000	371000	This beam of light has run out of this boundary.
371000	375000	Basically, it is unlikely to hit back again.
375000	378000	On the one hand, the energy you hit is getting lower and lower.
378000	381000	Its path will be shorter and shorter.
381000	384000	So this is basically a little bit.
384000	386000	Just connect this equation.
386000	388000	What is he talking about?
388000	390000	Take advantage of this problem.
390000	391000	OK.
391000	394000	Speaking of Particle Transport.
394000	396000	Its application is actually very wide.
396000	401000	What I just talked about is a medical radiation device.
401000	405000	Or a physical accelerator that is often used.
405000	407000	You need to generate high energy particles.
407000	410000	Basically, you know that when the electric field is turning.
410000	412000	You will put the light out.
412000	417000	Basically, you will need to design its radiation barrier.
417000	418000	How do you design it?
418000	421000	To make the staff at work.
421000	426000	Don't let its dosage exceed the specified limit.
426000	431000	Whether it's nuclear fusion or nuclear separation reaction.
431000	433000	I basically need it.
433000	435000	Nuclear fusion reaction, if you need a place.
435000	438000	Basically, it's the same as I said.
438000	440000	It's basically a high-energy particle.
440000	441000	You cut it out again.
441000	442000	It will emit light.
442000	445000	Basically, you will have the same radiation barrier.
445000	447000	The problem needs to be calculated.
447000	449000	Nuclear separation reaction is no longer necessary.
450000	453000	From the core to the radiation barrier outside.
453000	456000	Basically, you need Particle Transport.
456000	457000	Okay.
457000	461000	Here is a brief introduction to Deep Penetration Problem.
461000	463000	Basically, I just talked about Particle Transport.
463000	464000	There are many applications.
464000	468000	Basically, Deep Penetration Problem is radiation barrier calculation.
468000	472000	How much radiation barrier material do you need?
472000	474000	In front of your staff.
474000	478000	Let your dosage reach the value you want.
478000	479000	It's not too high.
479000	482000	Basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem in academia.
482000	484000	Why do we talk about Deep Penetration Problem?
484000	486000	Because these particles need to go through.
486000	490000	If it has to go through such a thick barrier.
490000	492000	Basically, this calculation is not very easy.
492000	495000	So basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem.
495000	497000	Generally speaking, if you are talking about radiation barriers.
497000	499000	We will have an interesting example.
499000	501000	Basically, there are only three.
501000	502000	Mainly the first two.
502000	503000	Medium value and light value.
503000	506000	Basically, there is time for electrons.
506000	508000	Basically, when you need electrons.
508000	511000	Most of them are in medical equipment.
511000	514000	Medical radiation radiation source equipment.
514000	516000	In the nuclear industry.
516000	518000	Basically, we do not consider this.
518000	519000	Because it is an electrolyte.
519000	520000	Then it's light.
520000	522000	It basically can't get out.
522000	524000	And the nuclear industry is basically.
524000	527000	The barriers you don't see are basically very thick.
527000	528000	So these two.
528000	529000	The first two are basically without electricity.
529000	531000	So it's easier to get out.
531000	534000	Basically.
534000	535000	Basically, every calculation.
535000	537000	You have to have his goal.
537000	539000	Basically, we just talked about it.
539000	542000	You have to protect the staff.
542000	543000	And you have to calculate.
543000	545000	Know how much your dosage is.
545000	550000	Here I listed some of the general.
550000	553000	The unit we will use for radiation.
553000	556000	You can take a look.
556000	559000	This is not directly related to the topic I am talking about today.
559000	561000	Just mention it a little bit.
561000	563000	You basically have some units.
563000	567000	It is considered to be biological.
567000	569000	Like these are what we usually use.
569000	571000	Some of them are not.
571000	573000	Because you have these different particles.
573000	576000	It may cause damage to our human body.
576000	577000	Will be different.
577000	578000	Especially the seed.
578000	580000	OK.
580000	582000	Ok, then.
582000	585000	If we take a system to do.
585000	586000	Which one is.
586000	587000	If there is a color system.
587000	588000	Let's do it.
588000	589000	For example.
589000	591000	You can take this.
592000	594000	This should be very necessary in Taiwan now.
594000	595000	Because Taiwan is basically.
595000	597000	Now the nuclear power plant is going to be established.
597000	598000	You will have these radiation.
598000	600000	In the process of loading the barrel.
600000	601000	In the process of shipping.
601000	603000	You basically have to.
603000	606000	Calculate how much radiation it will protect.
606000	608000	Basically, you can see.
608000	610000	Here is the nuclear fuel inside.
610000	612000	These nuclear fuels are basically.
612000	615000	Burned in the reactor.
615000	617000	I'm talking about burning here.
617000	618000	Actually, it's not burning.
618000	620000	It is nuclear transmutation.
620000	622000	Yes, because basically the nuclear reaction.
622000	625000	It's not the same as the general chemical reaction.
625000	627000	Yes, basically you.
627000	628000	Burned in the reactor.
628000	631000	It's basically been activated.
631000	633000	Is being activated.
633000	634000	Then you basically.
634000	636000	There may be these.
636000	637000	These radiation.
637000	639000	These radiation are basically.
639000	640000	Spent nuclear.
640000	641000	Is.
641000	642000	Used nuclear fuel.
642000	644000	Basically, it may be released.
644000	646000	Basically, you can't just.
646000	647000	Take it out.
647000	648000	Then.
648000	650000	Use people to operate.
650000	652000	So basically it's all mechanical.
652000	653000	Then put it in these barrels.
653000	655000	These barrels are basically very thick.
655000	657000	That light inside.
657000	659000	Inside is the inner barrel.
659000	660000	Basically, that steel.
660000	662000	That stainless steel is basically.
662000	664000	It's already 25 centimeters thick.
664000	666000	So basically there is such a thick.
666000	667000	There is such a thick.
667000	668000	Radiation barrier.
668000	669000	You basically have some particles.
669000	671000	You don't need to think about it at all.
671000	672000	For example, Alpha Particle.
672000	673000	Alpha Particle.
673000	674000	You are basically in the air.
674000	676000	It's about five centimeters.
676000	677000	So don't say you have.
677000	678000	You have a little bit.
678000	679000	Then Electron doesn't have to say.
679000	681000	It is very light and has electricity.
681000	682000	Then Neutrinos basically.
682000	683000	It doesn't react with matter.
683000	685000	So we don't consider it.
685000	686000	So basically.
686000	687000	Ah.
687000	688000	We basically.
688000	689000	You are in the nuclear industry.
689000	690000	We have to calculate.
690000	691000	Ah.
691000	692000	If it's a measure.
692000	694000	Basically, most of them are these two.
694000	696000	And it's about 100%.
696000	697000	The rest is basically.
697000	699000	You can say it is negligible.
699000	701000	It depends on the case.
701000	702000	OK.
702000	703000	So basically you can see that.
703000	705000	Because we only.
705000	708000	Only interested in this non-electric particle.
708000	709000	So we just use this.
709000	710000	Steady linear.
710000	712000	Steady linear Boltzmann equation.
712000	713000	Basically, you can use it directly.
713000	714000	Ah.
714000	715000	To do this calculation.
715000	716000	OK.
716000	717000	Ok.
717000	718000	Then you want to do this calculation.
718000	719000	The physical model behind you has developed well.
719000	720000	It is.
720000	721000	Ah.
721000	722000	Transport equation.
722000	724000	Basically, you basically have to.
724000	726000	To solve this equation.
726000	727000	Ah.
727000	728000	But that equation.
728000	729000	You just saw it.
729000	730000	Basically, it has.
730000	731000	Ah.
731000	732000	If you expand all the variables.
732000	733000	Include.
733000	734000	If it includes time.
734000	735000	It has seven variables.
735000	736000	Ah.
736000	737000	XYZ.
737000	738000	Ah.
738000	739000	Then the energy.
739000	740000	Then the angle.
740000	741000	Is the particle.
741000	742000	What angle does it shoot?
742000	743000	Then.
743000	744000	There are basically two angles.
744000	745000	It has.
745000	746000	Ah.
746000	747000	Z-multiple and polar.
747000	748000	And then.
748000	749000	It also has time.
749000	750000	Basically, there are seven.
750000	751000	Then it.
751000	752000	That.
752000	753000	That.
753000	754000	That.
754000	755000	That.
755000	756000	That.
756000	757000	That.
757000	758000	That.
758000	759000	That.
759000	760000	That.
760000	761000	That.
761000	762000	That.
762000	763000	That.
763000	764000	That.
764000	765000	That.
765000	766000	That.
766000	767000	That.
767000	768000	That.
768000	769000	That.
769000	770000	That.
770000	771000	That.
771000	772000	Ah.
772000	773000	Ah.
773000	774000	Ah.
774000	775000	Ah, basically, you can only solve the number.
775000	776000	So, basically, the number is.
776000	777000	This is the first deterministic model here.
777000	778000	You really have to go.
778000	779000	This equation.
779000	780000	Break it down one piece at a time.
780000	781000	Then you can see it has a lot of.
781000	782000	It is a square of space.
782000	783000	It is XYZ.
783000	784000	You have to break everything down.
784000	785000	And then you have to break down the energy.
785000	786000	And then there are two parts of the angle.
786000	787000	You have to break down.
787000	788000	So, this is basically a module.
789000	790000	It is a very difficult process.
790000	791000	There is another method.
791000	792000	It is basically a Monte Carlo method.
792000	793000	You can put this whole.
793000	794000	You can use this method.
794000	795000	Basically, you can.
795000	796000	You do not have to go directly.
796000	797000	The one who solved the equation.
797000	798000	You basically, we are.
798000	799000	All the physical processes.
799000	800000	Turn it into a probability function.
800000	801000	Then go down to do the signal.
801000	802000	Basically, these two methods.
802000	803000	It has good and bad.
803000	804000	So, basically, I am now.
804000	805000	I will talk about it next.
805000	806000	Where is it good and bad?
806000	807000	And why is it bad?
807000	808000	Because it is a.
808000	809000	It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.
809000	810000	It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.
