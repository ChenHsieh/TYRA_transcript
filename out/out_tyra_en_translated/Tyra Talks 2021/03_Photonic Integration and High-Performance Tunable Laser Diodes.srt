00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Taira Talk on March 20th.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today's speaker is Dr. Su Guanlin.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He was a doctorate student at UIUC, and then a post-doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today, he is going to talk about the direction of his research, which is collective light path, continuous light study, integrated process, and wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The topic he is going to talk about today is his work at UC Berkeley.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think it has a lot to do with semiconductor laser and its integration.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's start with Dr. Guanlin.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you, Jason. Thank you, everyone, for coming to my talk.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want to thank Taira for providing this platform so that we can talk about this topic today.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
My topic today is high-performance and high-performance wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As Jason just mentioned, this is something I studied at UC Berkeley as a post-doctoral researcher.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The unit I am currently affiliated with is Intel Labs Research Scientist.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why do I want to mention this field in particular?

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In fact, you may not be familiar with this picture.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is a Wi-Fi input test web page.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Wi-Fi on the screen that I will connect to you today is actually built up by light integration technology.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is called optical transceiver.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This green row is all optical transceiver.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's all equipped with light integration technology components.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is also the most competitive field in light integration technology.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Even though it's very competitive, it's just the beginning.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Light integration technology has actually developed a lot of opportunities.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I personally think this technology is a very balanced combination of laser physics, light, and semiconductor manufacturing.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think it's quite aesthetic.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I hope to invest a lot.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
As Jason just said, if we can make good use of Terra Journal Club,

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I believe we can find a lot of people in this field who have the same morality and then further promote it.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My talk today is mainly divided into three parts.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The first part is the introduction.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will introduce to you what is light integration technology.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And some of its basics.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then there are two examples.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have done two examples in Berkeley.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's probably a very wide, widely tunable.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It can be tuned to a few nanometers.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And the second one is a system-level work.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a laser power guiding system.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's kind of like we want to demo a data center.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A very energy-saving network resource distribution system.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is also done by using light integration.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The rest is my summary.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry to give you a disclaimer.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Because I am now working on light integration technology.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
One of the benefits is Intel.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My opinion today, my discovery, and my summary.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In fact, it does not represent the company's position.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can think of me as a postdoc.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is light integration technology?

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In fact, we all know that there is nothing too fresh under the sun.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Light integration technology allows light resources to go back to the microwave resources.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We are going to go from the table to the source.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We are going to go from the table to the source today.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is what light integration technology represents.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The essence of technology is like this.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This technology was proposed by Stuart Miller in 1969.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This article was a very important article.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He mentioned three very important points.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The first is how we get the light from the optical table to the chip.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We have to create a certain optical distortion rate on this chip.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It can also form a web-guided structure.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
After this thing is realized, he said.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
After this thing is realized, we can improve the stability of the whole system.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Its reliability will increase.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Unlike doing free space, we often need to adjust some components.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When everything is on the same chip, this thing can be omitted.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can ignore this step.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After this step is completed, he made the boldest prediction.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He thinks this thing will have a certain market scale.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Today, 50 years later, we can see that the light receiver is a very novel market.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is basically in line with his prediction.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What he didn't predict is that humans have broken through the synthesis process of a single chip.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We can now synthesize more materials on a single chip.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or we can synthesize two chips of different materials together.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It can break the physical limit set by a single material.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is our hybridization material.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
At the same time, if you combine a lot of materials of different optical properties,

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you can break the physical limit set by a single material.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This thing is also a powerful force that promotes the advancement of the industrial world and the academic world.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is basically the most intense field at present.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The left side is the traditional light communication, sensing, and network systems.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For example, last year, two terabits per second were demonstrated.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's not just a light receiver, it's also a PGA.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is a very, very new result.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This was in March of last year.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, about ten years ago,

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Onchip, which was made on a single-chip,

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
is the optical prime of a chip.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It has a bandwidth of 300 MHz.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is the last year's 30 parallel channels light radar.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the most studied technology in LiDAR.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a 30-channel light radar.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is a very large amount of transmission.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
In Japan, AIST also showed 800 Gbps data transmission.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's a light-operated data transmission.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And it's Lossless.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Basically, it doesn't matter how much power goes in, how much power comes out.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No loss.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In the more cutting-edge field,

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
For example, machine learning, quantum, and NIST,

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The American Academy of Science and Technology,

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In 2018, they demonstrated a optical frequency transmitter.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Directly in C-band, the so-called 1550nm,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
1.93kHz,

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It directly generates an optical frequency.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And its frequency can be up to 1Hz.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That is to say, its error is only 10-14 to 10-15.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is a very fine frequency generator.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A Spanish group also made an optical FPGA last year.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It is composed of multiple unit cells.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It can do all kinds of transfer functions.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you want to program it, you can program it.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
A few years ago, it also came out.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Use optical circuits to make convolutional neural networks.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It can do image vision.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Connecting these two most extreme fields,

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In fact, what can't be separated from the industrial and academic fields is our so-called high-performance light source.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Based on optical integration technology,

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The bandwidth of our current bioluminescence laser has been compressed to about 3Hz.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Turnability has also exceeded 100nm.

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is C-band, so it is about 1550nm.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So it can be adjusted from 14 to 1600nm.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And our optical amplifiers on the chip

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It has now exceeded 27dB, which is 500 times the optical amplification.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It can bear 500 times the loss on the chip.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It can continue to recover your signal.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Then there is a frequency cone.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It can produce direct 4-cell.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So this is a very groundbreaking work.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In fact, these more amazing studies,

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In fact, the following things are very basic, very fundamental things.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's our so-called waveguiding.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What Miller mentioned just now,

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is the difference in the loss rate caused by a single chip?

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The one on the left is a SEM, a optical chip.

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The SEM of the light path inside

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The light is transmitted in these so-called light path lines.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When we cut this straight waveguide,

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In the cross-sectional area,

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We see such a material distribution.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
For example, in this paper,

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The material of the light path is a single-chip.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Below it is a low-resolution,

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That is, the two-chip is the material below it.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's all air.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So if you cut a chip,

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can see its index.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Its resolution distribution is actually a step thing.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Under these boundary conditions,

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Our Maxwell's equation will actually degenerate into an eigenvalue problem.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Its solution is Lissan.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then this solution is our so-called waveguiding mode.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Its solution basically looks like this.

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's different from the plane wave.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Waveguiding mode,

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is defined by an equivalent resolution.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Its equivalent resolution is somewhere between the low-resolution and the high-resolution.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Then its field shape is basically a certain rule.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Its peak value is a semi-wavelength.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can fit in this index.

161
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then its peak value is probably in the middle.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then we can change this light path.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Our so-called waveguiding.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Its light path, its interface,

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We can engineer its mode.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
For example, we can have this.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A little wider,

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We can now fit in three modes.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
For example, there are several more than just now.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So we just need to be able to master this light path.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Its basic design,

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For example, its material,

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Its index gap,

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The gap between light and snow,

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The gap between light and snow,

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And its size.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We can design different photonic devices,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Photonic components.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In this talk,

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I want to introduce a few photonic components.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
First of all, this is what I just said.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If we use a single mode,

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A single light path that can only support one mode.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We trigger a light path that can support multiple modes.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This light path is relatively fat.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then I can trigger many waveguiding modes at the same time.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then they will interfere.

188
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This interference pattern can be accurately predicted.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For example, this is a very standard light path.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If we cut off this relatively thick wave at the right length,

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We can make a light path.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is a light path.

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is a light path.

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is a light path.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Then,

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then,

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is a light path.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is a light path.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then we are a 1x3 light path.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Then we have a single mode,

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We set up two mirrors.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Partially mirrored, or 100%.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It can form a cavity.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is a cavity.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If we add some photonic components to this cavity,

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That is to say, it provides gain.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then you can compensate for the loss of the entire cavity.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Under the right conditions,

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It will form our so-called photoreceptor.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is our laser.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What about this curve?

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
One by one,

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It actually reflects that

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All that can be seen in this photoreceptor

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It forms a whole number of waves.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The wave field.

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is our so-called magnet.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Longitudinal mode.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is the magnet.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It mainly emits light.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
These wave fields.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Of course, we can also put a single-core

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Single-core single-mode waveguide.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We use a more complicated loop to make it into a filter.

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The first filter is our so-called Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In addition,

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You can also make it into a circular photoreceptor.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That is to say, the light hit in here.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The light coming out of here can also have a filter effect.

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Its transfer function is a very classic sine wave.

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is a sine wave.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
From 0% to 8%.

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That environment.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Its transfer function is a sharp thing.

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because it needs to achieve a resonance in the middle.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So its frequency selection is very large.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It is very fine.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But at the same time, it is also difficult to reach 100%.

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In these devices that are used to form resonance in the future.

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Whether it's a cavity or a filter.

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The distance between our resonance points.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Basically, it depends on the size of our feature layer.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
For example, in this cavity.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Laser cavity.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The distance between these grids.

247
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's actually very different from the resonance field.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And in Mach-Zehnder's interferometer.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In the middle of these resonance points.

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's the length that comes out of this.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's also inverted.

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In the same way.

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The distance between these two resonance points.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And the radius of this transverse resonator.

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That is to say, its wavelength is inverted.

256
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
These devices with resonance features.

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Of course, after we do it.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
After we realize it.

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It must be different from what we expected at the time.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because there will be various errors in the process.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So we may have to add some.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Our so-called phase tuner.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We can use.

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Substantially change this.

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The detection coefficient on a certain waveguide.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For example, heating.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Substantial heating.

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Or adding a power plant.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Or adding current.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Turn off the current.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
To stimulate these electron hole pairs.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We can change its optical detection rate.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then we can.

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Put these.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We used to miss the resonance points.

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Move it to where we want it to be.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So basically.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
As long as you are familiar with these components.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can build a more complex system.

280
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you have any ideas.

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can use some well-known components to build it.

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm going to talk about it now.

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The first example I want to introduce to you.

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Is this.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ah.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We are on the single-conductive material.

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There is also a single-conductive.

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Integrated platform.

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They made it.

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The platform.

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I will do a demonstration with him later.

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ah.

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is.

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In fact.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a single-conductive material.

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's not a multi-conductive material.

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This one.

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You decide.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The idea is that the two juices are theoretically exactly the same.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And when they launch, they will have a very uniform shape.

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's just optical.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's just the shape of the frequency of this optical controversy.

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ah.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So you see every line.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They actually don't have a lot of energy.

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But if we listen to the laser, we are in this.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This one.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Every product is inserted into a optical filter.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Ah.

311
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This optical filter can be controlled by external signals.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
For example.

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Ah.

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is our so-called light barrier.

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then he can.

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He can only choose one laser model.

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He suppresses other laser models.

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So when he has a shock radiation, he is a single-mole laser.

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And he has a very strong one.

320
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Ah.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is a well-defined mode.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Only his power is obviously a lot bigger than that.

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So what kind of applications does he have?

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He's the first one.

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It can be used in gas.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ah.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Ah.

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
My class.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's optical.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Optical.

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It can be used to track a certain party.

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Or in the sound optical field.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He can do it.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The part of the body.

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then his light transmission is also a more traditional application.

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Ah.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
For example.

338
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hong Kong communication.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Or the same tone communication.

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's all a main force.

341
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's a new one.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hong Kong is introducing to you.

343
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The frequency-continuous wave light radar.

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He still has.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The main force is.

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He is.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The main light source of the frequency-continuous wave.

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Color.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Military Wave.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The frequency generation.

354
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's also called Tunable Laser.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Tunable Laser.

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What is his main metric?

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are his main parameters?

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
For example.

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The most classic one.

361
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I just introduced to you.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's a.

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Ah.

364
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
One.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The back side is replaced by a light bomb.

366
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That light bomb.

367
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
After you put the current in it.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
His index will change.

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That is, the light bomb.

370
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
His.

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
His.

372
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The black weapon in the middle.

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
His.

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
His maximum reflectivity.

375
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The wave field can be.

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because.

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Add current.

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then control.

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That he.

380
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That laser.

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
After the shock radiation.

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
His laser spectrum.

383
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It basically looks like this.

384
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ah.

385
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Until that one.

386
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He's a single mass.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My.

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
His laser.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why doesn't look like this?

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Top wind with this second wind.

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Power in the middle.

392
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,020
The difference is a 40 bibi, which is our so-called Punk wants.

393
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,000
He's al.

394
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The mainstream wind and the wind.

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The igen they stand between each other.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
10 to 10.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's in the BB.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
For the second.

399
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The second.

400
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Who the hell is the parameter?

401
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What is the original parameter?

402
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm going to say.

403
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So much.

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When he continues.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In the case of continuous power supply.

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He can.

407
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He can.

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He has a total of his weapons that can be adjusted.

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How much?

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Of course, his output power is also a main measurement goal.

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Milliwatt or dbm to show.

412
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And his efficiency.

413
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For example, his.

414
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
How much power do you put in?

415
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
How much power does it give you?

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Such a conversion efficiency.

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's a line with.

418
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is our frequency.

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Accuracy.

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Then it's because of the client.

421
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
A little better.

422
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If it's a little worse, it's basically this number.

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What if it's like this example?

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This traditional dbm laser.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He only has one.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ah.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In the case of a filter.

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The most we do is adjust 5 to 6 nanometers.

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This is a material limit.

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So how do we get tens of nanometers?

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Or like the example I just did.

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
More than 100 nanometers of tuning.

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We mainly have two means.

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This can be achieved.

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is the so-called white ability.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The first one is to use.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah, but it's a pair.

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That is to say, we are using a pair.

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This is the structure.

440
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
For example, the circular oscillator or the light.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ah, light.

442
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This kind of explosion.

443
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
As long as you are a pair, you can do this.

444
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What does that mean?

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This example is that we have two circular oscillators.

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
His.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The environment is different.

448
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What about when the environment is different?

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He's this.

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Between the two points of resonance.

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We have the so-called Fritz.

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Fsr.

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's different.

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
For example, the green ring.

455
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He.

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We can see the green ring and the orange ring.

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a little different.

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So it leads to the two of them.

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
When they are together.

460
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Only in their ally.

461
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This place.

462
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
130 nanometers.

463
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
His transmission is the highest.

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Then when you.

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Ah.

466
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In the middle of this green ring.

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Add an object.

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
After a three-dimensional movement.

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He can move a little bit.

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Just move a little bit.

471
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But their.

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The second overlapping place is directly from 130 to 1290 nanometers.

473
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So he's just.

474
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You just have to move about 1 to 2 nanometers.

475
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The wind.

476
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What about your overall score?

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You can jump ten times.

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This is what we call the so-called oil marker effect.

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I've used oil markers.

480
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They all know that there are two degrees above.

481
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They are a little bit away.

482
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This is what they are.

483
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You move one of them a little bit.

484
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The next time they come.

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's very far away.

486
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Then this.

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
His.

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ah.

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
His second feature.

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's just that he's got a very small.

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This.

492
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This.

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Ah.

494
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He can make a big one for you.

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Frequency jump.

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Another feature.

497
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's usually this kind of parallel structure.

498
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
His role is relatively sharp.

499
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
In other words, his filter works very well.

500
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But he's another semi-permanent.

501
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
One of the more significant shortcomings is that he's more.

502
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Because.

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He is a result.

504
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So he.

505
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Two small things into one.

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He's getting smaller and smaller.

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
When you connect more and more.

508
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's getting bigger and bigger.

509
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For example, you can see him.

510
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
From 80% to 64%.

511
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's another way.

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Just use light interference.

513
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's what we just said.

514
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
A single color.

515
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's under this architecture.

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We're just going to cut the structure in half.

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then add the mirror directly.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We all know this.

519
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This mirror image.

520
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It can be used as a single color.

521
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
His.

522
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
His transfer function.

523
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's the classic.

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then as long as one of the.

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
100% reflection.

526
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That.

527
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He's a continuous tuning.

528
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's what he.

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's the type of thing that jumps.

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He is.

531
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He's moving as much as you add.

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
How much.

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But it should.

534
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He's not like this.

535
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's not like this.

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The more you wear, the more he loses.

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Uh, but his shortcomings.

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's also obvious that his role is slower.

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's just that he's particularly close to this.

540
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The top of the three-way.

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So his.

542
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uh.

543
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Frequency selection.

544
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's not as good as this one.

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't know if it's so good.

546
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Whether it's an effect.

547
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's the kind of resonance.

548
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Whether it's a resonance or this interference.

549
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This kind of component.

550
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He.

551
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We've seen it.

552
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He can be used.

553
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Uh.

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It can be adjusted.

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's a price.

556
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For example.

557
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
On the single-fingered.

558
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He is.

559
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's already reached a commodity level.

560
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
A parameter.

561
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It can be adjusted.

562
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
For example.

563
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There's a front light.

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Backlight.

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
There's a layer of light in the middle.

566
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There's an external magnifier on the outside.

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
At the same time.

568
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
To magnify.

569
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Uh.

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's used to magnify light.

571
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
His.

572
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Range.

573
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It can be adjusted.

574
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
About 40 nanometers.

575
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
His.

576
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's the wind.

577
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If you press the wind.

578
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
About 50 db.

579
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's 100,000 times the pressure.

580
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Uh.

581
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's already at 100.

582
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But in the case of an external magnifier.

583
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It can be up to 40.

584
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Uh.

585
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Uh.

586
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is a commodity scale.

587
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
A parameter.

588
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That.

589
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Next is.

590
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
On the second.

591
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The platform will be introduced to you later.

592
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
On the silicon.

593
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We.

594
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Already.

595
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Humans have made countless nanometers.

596
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
More than 50.

597
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Uh.

598
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
db.

599
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
SMSR.

600
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And then.

601
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's less than 100.

602
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because he doesn't have an external magnifier.

603
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
In fact, he.

604
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Uh.

605
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Nine.

606
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's still relative.

607
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A more.

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Uh.

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
A power level.

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That.

611
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
In this.

612
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Light.

613
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Light interference.

614
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The method.

615
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In.

616
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Most of the time.

617
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's in the single-finger.

618
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They make monolithic.

619
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
A little.

620
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's it.

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's three.

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Really.

623
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Stuck together.

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That.

625
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It can be up to 74 nanometers.

626
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You.

627
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Uh.

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
At the same time.

629
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
About 40 db.

630
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Or more.

631
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
A little bit.

632
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Uh.

633
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Power is relatively low.

634
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He only has one.

635
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's it.

636
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This example.

637
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He's this year.

638
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He just came out last year.

639
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He's eight.

640
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Uh.

641
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
More.

642
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
More extreme.

643
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A means.

644
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
He has eight.

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Mzi.

646
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
8.

647
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The interference.

648
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
He's a total of 45 nanometers.

649
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Uh.

650
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
50 db.

651
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SMSR.

652
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
His language.

653
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's also down to 160.

654
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Uh.

655
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Power is also better than the previous one.

656
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
50.

657
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Uh.

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
About five.

659
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But.

660
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You can see that they are involved.

661
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They use a lot of filters.

662
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Compared to this.

663
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
This kind of use.

664
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Uh.

665
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They need more filters.

666
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
To reach this level.

667
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
40 or 50 db.

668
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So we can see it very intuitively.

669
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
His control is how you want to go.

670
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's actually quite a challenge.

671
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What about this filter design?

672
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
In this example, you can see this.

673
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Light filter.

674
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
His design.

675
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It directly affects your laser performance.

676
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
This is very obvious.

677
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Then in 2011.

678
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Ah.

679
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Please say.

680
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh.

681
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
This is the language here.

682
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What is the laser language?

683
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Uh.

684
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What do you mean?

685
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Uh.

686
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That is.

687
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That is.

688
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
These languages are.

689
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Uh.

690
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He is.

691
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh.

692
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Intrinsic language.

693
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Is it related to his laser.

694
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Is it related to the gun?

695
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Or with.

696
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh.

697
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Right.

698
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He is.

699
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He is.

700
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Intrinsic.

701
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's right.

702
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You remember very well.

703
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He is.

704
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's related to the gun.

705
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Uh.

706
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If.

707
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
For.

708
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Uh.

709
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Laser.

710
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He is more.

711
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Just.

712
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I have prepared a more.

713
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Uh.

714
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A more graphic slide.

715
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What is his language?

716
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He's actually laser.

717
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
His.

718
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He's tired to death.

719
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
When he turned his body around.

720
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He's actually.

721
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Especially the semiconductor laser.

722
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He's in his background.

723
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
In fact, there is a very weak.

724
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's his.

725
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Uh.

726
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Self-radiation.

727
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's just that he hasn't reached the water.

728
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The thing that happened before.

729
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's the LED thing.

730
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Uh.

731
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
When it reaches the water.

732
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He's going to have a very clear one.

733
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Uh.

734
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The mechanism of radio radiation.

735
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But.

736
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And then this is my.

737
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Put this.

738
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The expression of that.

739
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's his.

740
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Instantaneous.

741
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The electric field inside the laser.

742
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
His face.

743
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
When the radiation occurs.

744
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
There will be a very large amount.

745
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
To show that he was the radiation field.

746
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But on top of this.

747
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's because he's got a lot of background.

748
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Uh.

749
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Self-radiation.

750
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So he's got this.

751
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He has a very weak one.

752
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
A very small amount.

753
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He has.

754
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He.

755
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's riding on this.

756
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This.

757
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
On top of the mobile radiation.

758
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
His lungs are random.

759
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It should be said that he is.

760
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So you can imagine.

761
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He's a very big amount.

762
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He's actually got a very small thing on top of it.

763
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So he's actually shaking.

764
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He's not.

765
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's not a very clear one.

766
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He's got a distribution.

767
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He's got a distribution.

768
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That's what we call the face.

769
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The face is not accurate.

770
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In fact, it is this.

771
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
His.

772
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
His.

773
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
His performance.

774
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They're only missing a factor in the middle.

775
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That's right.

776
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This.

777
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Live with him.

778
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The main thing is your gun.

779
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The longer the laser is, the longer the gun is.

780
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Your language can be lower.

781
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But the longer the gun is.

782
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's also.

783
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's also equivalent to your laser.

784
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Between the captain mode.

785
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's getting narrower.

786
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If it's getting narrower.

787
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If it's getting narrower, it's testing the design of your filter.

788
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
How to make this laser.

789
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
In.

790
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Maintaining a single film.

791
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Uh, it's harder to launch.

792
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So, in order to normalize the gun, it's still.

793
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
This is a blow.

794
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I understand.

795
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Thank you.

796
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Right.

797
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That.

798
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So we're in.

799
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Uh, so.

800
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We're in 2017.

801
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
When I was in the post office, we proposed a new architecture.

802
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We call it the three X.

803
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's actually also part of this kind of light.

804
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Light sensor system.

805
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
A filter effect.

806
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, he actually, we're talking about Bell Labs.

807
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In 1990, he did the Y-Laser.

808
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
At the time, they had two branches.

809
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's the only one.

810
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's what we call the.

811
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Uh, the sensor.

812
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So his.

813
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The SMSR is relatively low.

814
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The top of his side wave is very smooth.

815
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He only has 100 times the 20 dB.

816
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Uh, his tuning range is also relatively small.

817
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Only 8 nanometers.

818
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But we.

819
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Uh, based on theoretical calculations, we found that as long as you add the third R.

820
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The third branch.

821
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's equivalent to the two of us.

822
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's equivalent to the shortest one.

823
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This one.

824
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We have two.

825
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They each represent a very wide FSR and a very narrow FSR.

826
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Uh, through this, uh, mechanism, we can introduce two.

827
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The interference pattern of the front wave.

828
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We can.

829
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Max, we can design this tuning range separately.

830
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
With him.

831
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Improve his SMSR.

832
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
To achieve a, uh.

833
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Basically, it can decouple these two parameters.

834
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I want to be on the Y-Laser.

835
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
These two parameters are always.

836
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Uh, hand in hand.

837
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You want SMSR high.

838
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is.

839
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Intrinsic.

840
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Mathematically, it's such a.

841
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Uh, a reality.

842
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What kind of structure does that 3X laser have?

843
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This is a good explanation for everyone.

844
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This is.

845
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Uh, their transfer function.

846
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If this is the Y-Laser.

847
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's the front wave we just saw.

848
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But if there's a 3X, we add the second front wave.

849
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We're naturally on the outside.

850
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We're still the same as the Y-Laser.

851
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But in essence.

852
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In this.

853
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We have the second.

854
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Interference.

855
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That is, we can.

856
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We can.

857
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We can take this.

858
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It used to be very smooth.

859
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The front wave has become very sharp.

860
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Uh, further filter.

861
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't want to.

862
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't want to filter.

863
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't want to.

864
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If we're going to calculate it.

865
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
If you don't, you'll find this Y-Laser.

866
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's actually very dense at the top.

867
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That is to say.

868
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
These modes.

869
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It's actually with the main model.

870
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's what we want.

871
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
150 nanometers.

872
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
They're very close.

873
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They're very close.

874
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So, uh.

875
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But if you add.

876
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Like, if we add the third branch.

877
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We can filter out a lot.

878
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't want to.

879
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You see, we only have about four or five left.

880
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And they're with the main model.

881
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
There's a certain gap between their hands.

882
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So we can.

883
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, uh.

884
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Uh.

885
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Uh.

886
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Uh.

887
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Uh.

888
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Uh.

889
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Uh.

890
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Uh.

891
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Uh.

892
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Uh.

893
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Uh.

894
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Uh.

895
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Uh.

896
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Uh.

897
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Uh.

898
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Uh.

899
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Uh.

900
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Uh.

901
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Uh.

902
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Uh.

903
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Uh.

904
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Uh.

905
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Uh.

906
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Uh.

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Uh.

908
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Uh.

909
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Uh.

910
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Uh.

911
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Uh.

912
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Uh.

913
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Uh.

914
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Uh.

915
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Uh.

916
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Uh.

917
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh.

918
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Okay.

919
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll tried.

920
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
One.

921
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I back.

922
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And I kicked.

923
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
My body.

924
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Just.

925
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Uh.

926
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Uh.

927
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Uh.

928
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Uh.

929
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Uh.

930
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Uh.

931
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Uh.

932
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Uh.

933
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000

1098
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:52,000

1103
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:42,000

1104
01:05:42,000 --> 01:06:04,000

1106
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Oh, thank you.

1107
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Um.

1108
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Uh, I, I have a question here.

1109
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Uh.

1110
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Uh.

1111
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Uh.

1112
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So this is what we call a jump.

1113
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Uh, jump filter mode.

1114
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
What I just said is a jump.

1115
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Uh.

1116
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Uh.

1117
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Of course, he's testing.

1118
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's very obvious that you can see it when you're testing.

1119
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
For example, we can see that he has a middle jump here.

1120
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
He jumped again.

1121
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Jumped again.

1122
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
This is basically a jump.

1123
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Jump.

1124
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Uh, that's it.

1125
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You can also see this.

1126
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Every step.

1127
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That if it is.

1128
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
If it's a laser, he'll jump this.

1129
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Uh, filter mode.

1130
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yeah, that's it.

1131
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Is there any application of this?

1132
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
At present.

1133
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Uh, I haven't used it yet.

1134
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And.

1135
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
In fact, people hate this thing.

1136
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's because of the time.

1137
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That represents him.

1138
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Physically, he represents two.

1139
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
He competes with the carrier.

1140
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
When it's the most intense, it's the same input current.

1141
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
There are these two.

1142
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
He's giving you at the same time.

1143
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Grab this resource.

1144
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
That is, he was at that time.

1145
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Uh, noise is the biggest.

1146
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So everyone hates this thing happening.

1147
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Well, there's no way.

1148
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
This is physics.

1149
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
There's no way.

1150
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Uh huh.

1151
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But all of them.

1152
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
With that kind of micro ring.

1153
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Will there be this problem?

1154
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yes, all of them.

1155
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
As long as there is a filter.

1156
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He will have this problem.

1157
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Uh, the most frequent.

1158
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Uh, if the L I is.

1159
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Uh, there is no filter.

1160
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
As long as there is a filter, he will be like this.

1161
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Of course, he can play very high power.

1162
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But he is always multi mode.

1163
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
There is no way.

1164
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yes.

1165
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Don't worry.

1166
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Um.

1167
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Or use DFV.

1168
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
DFV is a single product.

1169
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Then he.

1170
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Uh, there won't be.

1171
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
This problem of motor.

1172
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Uh huh.

1173
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Hey, ask him.

1174
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
His mother.

1175
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
His.

1176
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Hey, can you give me some numbers?

1177
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I can't see it here.

1178
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
He's probably.

1179
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
How much frequency is this?

1180
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Uh, I think.

1181
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
OK.

1182
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Oh, it's okay.

1183
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Hey, I want to ask another question.

1184
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Hey, a little bit.

1185
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
His.

1186
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You have a character.

1187
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
What is his?

1188
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Uh, relaxation.

1189
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Is the frequency of the selection?

1190
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Oh, we don't have it.

1191
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Because of this platform.

1192
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
We are.

1193
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Uh, more.

1194
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
We are a foreign package.

1195
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
This is the Netherlands.

1196
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Uh.

1197
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
But you can guess very well.

1198
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
He is in the middle of 1 gigahertz to 3 gigahertz.

1199
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
He is not.

1200
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
He is not.

1201
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So, of course, this level.

1202
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
OK.

1203
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Thank you.

1204
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Correct.

1205
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But he has something to do with his resonance gun length.

1206
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
The longer your resonance gun is, the slower it is.

1207
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Correct.

1208
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
OK.

1209
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Well, if not.

1210
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Then I will end this recording here first.

1211
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Thank you all.

1212
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Thank you.

1213
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Thank you.
