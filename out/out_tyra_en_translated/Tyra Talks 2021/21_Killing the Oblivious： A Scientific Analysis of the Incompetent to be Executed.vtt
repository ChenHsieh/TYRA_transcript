00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, I'm Annie, and I'm honored to have Ian here to give us an amazing talk.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Ian is a PhD candidate at Cornell University.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Today's topic is called Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.

00:20.000 --> 00:31.000
Today's talk will be about 40-45 minutes, with a 10-15 minute Q&A.

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
The recording will be uploaded to Taira's YouTube channel or blog in about a week.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Ian.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you, Annie.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm not a PhD candidate yet, but I hope to be one soon.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm very happy to be here today, especially with the support of my Taiwanese friends.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
I'll try to be more introverted, and introduce the topic to those unfamiliar with it.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
I'll start by sharing my screen.

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
Can everyone see the video?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, I can.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
If you can't see the video, please let me know.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Today's topic is Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.

01:45.000 --> 02:00.000
In Chinese, the word oblivious refers to an ignorant person, or a person who has no awareness.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
It's a difficult word, so it's normal if you don't know it.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm Ian Su.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm a postdoctoral student at Cornell University.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm currently studying Human Development.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I'll be joining the Department of Psychology.

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
This is a project I'm working on with Cornell Law School.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Today's talk will be divided into three parts.

02:33.000 --> 02:47.000
In the first part, we'll go over the background of Killing the Oblivious.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
In the second part, we'll look at what the project is about.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
In the third part, I'll talk about how the project combines psychology and law.

03:00.000 --> 03:11.000
I'll use a simple way to explain how we view food.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I'll start with the first part.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
The reason I'm doing this research is because

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
I was a lawyer in Taiwan two years before I came to Cornell.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
During my time as a lawyer, I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I didn't choose to be involved in these cases,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
because my major was Law.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
My master's was Psychology.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
I was fortunate to be a lawyer with a background in both psychology and law.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
Many of the defendants were mentally ill.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
The reason I came to Cornell Law School

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
is because I had a five-year Ph.D. program in psychology,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
but they have a very strong cross-field discipline.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
They have a dual degree program.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
The professors here are very strong,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
and they like to combine psychology, law, and research topics.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Although I didn't mention the six-year dual degree program on the screen,

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
my professor told me that I already had a law degree in Taiwan,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
so I didn't need to come to the U.S. to study law.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
What I'm actually doing is trying to combine the law and psychology that I learned in the past

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
and see how I can use my research to study legal issues.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
The reason I started the killing the oblivious project

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
is because the two professors above me are professors in the Department of Human Development.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
They know that I had experience in the death penalty defense in Taiwan,

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
so they strongly recommended that I go to Professor John Bloom of Cornell Law School.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
and he is probably the most famous death penalty defense lawyer in the U.S.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
For example, he went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend himself eight times.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
For a lawyer in the U.S., this must be a very difficult experience.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
So I went to Professor John Bloom and asked him if he had any interesting topics that we could work on together.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Professor John Bloom is currently the Director of the Cornell Law School's Death Penalty Project.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Law schools in the U.S. usually have to study for three years,

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
and in the first two years, students will look for the so-called legal aid,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
the so-called legal aid clinic course,

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
and students will usually choose a certain professor to lead the clinic

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
and hold a special case for this professor.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
so his legal aid clinic is also a case related to death penalty defense.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
So he has been working on this relevant topic.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
And because death penalty is very special,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
it is often intertwined with many psychological or psychological issues.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
So these two books are some of the books he helped with.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Professor John Bloom studies death penalty from a lawyer's point of view.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
In the process of death penalty,

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
he may often come into contact with some so-called intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
So he may use a more legal perspective to discuss or observe these things.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Today, we will not discuss the nature of death penalty,

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
but will focus on one of the issues from a purely academic point of view.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Cornell is quite special.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
In addition to focusing on local death cases in the United States,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
he also has another center that looks at the death penalty all over the world.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
For example, they are currently looking at how to look at it from a more human perspective,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
even if it is death penalty.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
Some countries may lack the so-called legal procedure for the execution of death penalty.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
For example, Cornell's Law School is currently helping some African countries

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
to reform the execution method of death penalty or related laws.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
So this is probably why I am in contact with death penalty-related psychological research here at Cornell.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Because he originally had these faculty members doing these researches.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Now we come to the main topic, what is Killing a Belief?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What is he going to discuss?

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
The first part is that this research is about criminal liability.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
You may think that this ability is abstract.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Basically, in the general criminal litigation process,

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
because you can imagine that in Taiwan, Taiwan is a three-level, three-provincial system.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
So if there is a criminal case today, and it involves a death penalty,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
for example, a more serious case, such as murder,

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
it will go all the way from the local court to the high court to the Supreme Court.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The situation in the United States is similar.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
In this process, in addition to the judge going to interrogate some facts,

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
the judge must also pay attention to whether the parties in the process have the ability to arrest the parties.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
So in the U.S. judicial process, including Taiwan, there is a similar law.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
Usually, I list the four basic abilities that the parties need to have.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
The first is that the parties must have the ability to interrogate.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
That is to say, at least he needs to know what the court process means,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and what the role of each person is.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
The second ability is competency to plead guilty.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
That is to say, if he pleads guilty, does it count?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
If he is mentally ill, does he have the ability to plead guilty for himself?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
The third ability is competency to waive the right to counsel.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
In the United States, it is more special that these serious crimes are not necessarily forced defense cases.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
That is to say, the government does not necessarily need to help him get a lawyer.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
In this case, or if it is a forced defense case,

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
can the parties say, I think I have the ability to defend myself,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
can I waive the counsel?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I don't need a lawyer to help me.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
If a party makes such a statement, is it an effective statement?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
The last ability is competency for execution.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
This ability is very specific, only in criminal cases.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
That is the topic we will focus on today.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Competency for execution means that if a case involves execution,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
in the end, he is sentenced to death,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
and after being sentenced to death,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
that is to say, this person is already in the so-called death penitentiary.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
He also obtained an execution date,

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
that is to say, maybe the state government has issued a date of execution,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
where and how he will be executed.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
In this case,

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
he himself or his defense team can help him fight for

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
that this person may not have the ability to be executed.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
We will explain later why the ability to be executed is needed.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
For example, he may have serious mental disorders, etc.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
This is also equivalent to the judicial procedure,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
if it involves an execution case,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
he will need the ability to be sentenced in the end.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
We will focus on the last one today,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
competency for execution.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
In Taiwan, the current method is more like the ability to be executed.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
At present, Taiwan's execution method is also being revised.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It should be revised recently.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
This ability is quite interesting.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
It originates from the U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
The U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment also states that

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
there is no way to tolerate

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
a cruel or unusual way of punishment.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Whether in Taiwan or the U.S.,

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
execution is a way to punish criminals.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
So, in the U.S. judicial discussion,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
if it is related to execution,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
it is usually quoted in the sentence of the 8th amendment of the Constitution

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
to discuss the execution.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
For example, the most common discussion may be the purgatory,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
where the execution is considered unethical or cruel.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
As for the specific method of execution,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
the U.S. Supreme Court has three very decisive judgments.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
They are Fort, Penelope, and Madison.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Today, we will introduce these three judgments.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Why do we need to discuss them?

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
The reason why we need to do this research is because

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
although I just explained competency for execution,

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
it is a legal ability that judges need to consider.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
But in fact, its standards are very self-explanatory.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Although in the past Supreme Court judgments,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
it said that to have the ability to be executed,

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
you must be able to understand the facts in a rational way.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
What is execution?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And why are you sentenced to death?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Or why are you sentenced to death?

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
And when this person accepts the relevant judicial procedures for execution,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
he must have the ability to help his lawyer.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Although the court has these two standards,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
how do you actually,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
for example, if a psychologist or psychiatrist,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
how do they operate this standard is very self-explanatory.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Next, we will go through these three judgments

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
and talk about what impact these three judgments have on competency for execution.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Before we talk about the judgment,

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
I can give you an overview of what the U.S. execution procedure is like.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's a bit similar to Taiwan.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
So let's start with the column on the far left.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Generally speaking, the three columns on the left are very similar to Taiwan's three-level three-judgment system.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
The bottom left is similar to our local courts.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Then the top left is the Supreme Court,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and the top right is the Supreme Court.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
So generally speaking, the death sentence will almost always end

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
at the three levels of the column on the left.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Because it's a more serious crime,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
and it may be related to life.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Generally speaking, if we take Taiwan or the U.S. as an example,

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
sentences that are not related to execution usually end at the column on the far left.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But if it's a death sentence,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
they also have the so-called re-trial system,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
which is the middle column.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
The re-trial system also usually has the concept of the so-called three-level three-judgment,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
which may reach the Supreme Court all the way.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Re-trial means that the court may want to review some new evidence,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
or new facts, or new reasons, etc.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Each has different regulations.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
But simply put, it's not like the first column is over.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It will go to the second column.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Even most death sentences may go to the third column.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
The third column is very special in the U.S.,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
which is related to the part of the life protection order.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
It means that because the death sentence is a serious crime,

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
so they are in the process of the entire legal process.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
They are almost all locked up in the so-called death cell,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
or in the confinement cell.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
This is equivalent to locking people up.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
So as long as it's locked up with people,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
it may involve a violation of the law.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
According to the U.S. law,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
people can go through a three-level three-judgment system

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
based on the issue of life protection.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
So if a U.S. death sentence is a serious crime,

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
there will usually be the so-called nine steps.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
This is about five to ten years on average.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
So the process of execution is very long.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You might imagine that

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
if a person may have a mental disorder

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
or a lack of mental intelligence,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
the process of nine years is actually very dynamic.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
And because if they are all in the so-called prison,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
or if they are suppressed in some organs,

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
and the medical environment may not be so good,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
their mental state may deteriorate.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
This is a very common case in the U.S. death cell.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Even if they have been sentenced to death,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
it may be a very, very long process

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
from the day of execution to the day of execution.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
So the death sentence in the U.S.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
is a problem that many people will discuss.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
The death sentence in the U.S.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
has a huge number of people,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
with thousands of people in each unit.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And the number of people on duty

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
is also thousands of people in each unit.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
So it's less than 60 people

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
in the current death sentence in Taiwan.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
This is a big difference in the number of people.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So this is to show you

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
the process of execution in the U.S.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
There are about three parts,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and there are nine steps.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
The earliest sentence is called the Ford sentence.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It was the first time in the U.S. Supreme Court

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
to discuss the death sentence,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
because the law stipulates

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
how we should deal with it.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Mr. Ford himself,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
he committed the crime of killing a police officer.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
In the process of execution,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
it should be said that

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
in the process of case trial,

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
he had schizophrenia,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and he had some obvious delusions.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
For example, he had a delusion

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
that the U.S. was involved

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
in racial discrimination

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
with the 3K Party.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
So in the end,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
he went through the nine steps

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
that I just mentioned.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And then his lawyer

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
helped him file

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
the so-called claim

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
for the ability to be executed.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
The challenge is that

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
he may not be able to be executed

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because he had schizophrenia.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
He had a very serious delusion.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
At that time,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
the judge said

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
that they didn't judge

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Mr. Ford directly

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
whether he was crazy

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
enough to completely lose

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
the ability to be executed.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
But they gave a rough definition.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
In other words,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
as long as the person

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
who was executed

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
had the rational ability

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
to understand

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
his execution

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
and his reason,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
we would say that he was capable.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
On the contrary,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
he may not be able to be executed.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
This was a judgment

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
about 40 or 50 years ago in 1986.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
After the Supreme Court

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
made this judgment,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
he said,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
okay, we have finished the definition.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Then he threw it back

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
to the lower court

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
to judge

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
whether Mr. Ford

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
was capable of being executed

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
or not.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Unfortunately,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Mr. Ford passed away

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
due to other reasons.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
At that time,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
it was not clear

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
how to operate this definition.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It seemed that

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
everything was possible,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
but in practice,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
it seemed that

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Mr. Ford was not capable

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
of being executed.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So many cases

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
were failed.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
After 20 years,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
there was a second judgment

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
called Panetti v. Quarterman

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
in 2007.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
It was a judgment

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
after 20 years.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It was a similar situation

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
where the person

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
had a long history

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
of visual impairment

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
for example,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
he wore western jeans

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
and helped his lawyer

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
to open the court.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
He may decide

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
to call many different witnesses,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
such as the deceased

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
President of the United States

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
or Jesus,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
to be the witness of his case,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
which is not related

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
to the case itself.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
In this judgment,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
the judge

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
re-explained

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
the long history

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
of the previous judgment

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
in detail.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
However,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
this time,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
the judge

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
re-explained

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
the reason

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
for the execution

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and the reason

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
for the sentence.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
In this case,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the execution

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
is meaningless

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
because the judge

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
should be responsible

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
for what he did.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
If the judge

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
can't understand

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
what he did wrong,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
there is no way

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
for the execution

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
to work.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Therefore,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
when Panetti v. Quarterman

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
was released,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
the court finally agreed

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
to solve

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
the issue

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
after 20 years.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
However,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
the reason for the confusion

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
is that the court

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
has to say more

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
in the next 20 years.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
For example,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
there are psychiatrists

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
in psychology schools,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
so at least

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
there should be

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
some guidelines

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
for the execution.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
However,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
the judge

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
has to say more

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
in the next 20 years.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
For example,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
there are psychiatrists

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
in psychology schools,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
so at least

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
there should be

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
some guidelines for the execution.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
However,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the judge

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
has to say more

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
in the next 20 years.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
However,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
there are psychiatrists

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
in psychology schools,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
so at least

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
there should be

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
some guidelines

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
for the execution.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
However,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
there are psychiatrists

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
so at least

some guidelines

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
for the execution.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
However,

there are psychiatrists

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
However,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
there are psychiatrists

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
in psychology schools,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
so at least

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
there should be

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
some guidelines

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
for the execution.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
However,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
there are psychiatrists

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
in psychology schools,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
so at least

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
there should be

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
some guidelines

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
for the execution.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
However,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
there are psychiatrists

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
in psychology schools,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
so at least

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
there should be

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
some guidelines

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
for the execution.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
However,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
there are psychiatrists

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
in psychology schools,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
so at least

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
there should be

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
some guidelines

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
for the execution.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
However,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000

for the execution.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
However,

there are psychiatrists

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
in psychology schools,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
there should be

some guidelines

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
for the execution.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
However,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
there are psychiatrists

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
in psychology schools,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
so at least

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
there should be

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
some guidelines

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
for the execution.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
However,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
there are psychiatrists

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
in psychology schools,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
so at least

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
there should be

some guidelines

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
for the execution.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
However,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
there are psychiatrists

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
in psychology schools,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
so at least

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
there should be

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
some guidelines

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
for the execution.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
However,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
there are psychiatrists

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
in psychology schools,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
so at least

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
there should be

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
some guidelines

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
for the execution.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
However,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
there are psychiatrists

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
in psychology schools,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
so at least

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
there should be

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
some guidelines

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
for the execution.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
However,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
there are psychiatrists

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
in psychology schools,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
so at least

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
there should be

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
some guidelines

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
for the execution.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
However,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
there are psychiatrists

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
in psychology schools,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
so at least

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
there should be

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
some guidelines

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
for the execution.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
This is the second part.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
The third part

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
is about the

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
legal strategies

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
for the execution.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
The third part

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
is about the

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
legal strategies

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
for the execution.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You may think

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
that you know

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
the legal context

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
but you don't know

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
how to operate it.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
However,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
most of the laws

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
in Taiwan

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
are against the U.S.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
and other countries.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
In terms of

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
the execution

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
of the Fourth Claim,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
the progress between Taiwan

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
and the U.S.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
is not that different.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
We just started

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
a paper in 2014

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and we are still

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
working on it.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
At present,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
many U.S. law firms

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
will come up with

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
creative legal strategies

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
based on their lawyers.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
If a particular state

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
is successful,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
it may influence

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
other states.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
In the end,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
each state will

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
have its own

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
lawyers

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
who will

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
determine if

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
a particular client

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
has a serious mental illness

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and how to

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
deal with it.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
If the client

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
has been in the prison

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
for more than 10 years

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
and he looks very sick,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
the state government

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
will not issue a death warrant.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
If the state government

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
does not issue a death warrant,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
the defense lawyer

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
will have no choice

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
but to watch the client

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
either go crazy

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
or die in the prison

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
for other reasons.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
The defense lawyer

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
will coordinate with

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the state government

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
and if the client

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
is very sick,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
the state government

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
will issue a death warrant

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
for the client.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
If the client is in a

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
very bad condition

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
and the state government

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
does not issue a death warrant,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the defense lawyer

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
will not be able

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
to issue a death warrant

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
for the client.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
The defense lawyer

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
will not be able

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
to issue a death warrant

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
for the client.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Another example

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
is from California.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
The state government

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
will issue a death warrant

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
for the client

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
if the client

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
is in a bad condition

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and the state government

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
does not issue a death warrant

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
for the client.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
The state government

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
will issue a death warrant

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
for the client

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
if the client

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
is in a bad condition

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
and the state government

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
does not issue a death warrant

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
for the client.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Another example is

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
from California.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
The state government

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
will issue a death warrant

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
for the client

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
if the client

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
is in a bad condition

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
and the state government

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
does not issue a death warrant

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
for the client.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
So far,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
the first legal strategy

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
has been used a lot

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
and the probability of success

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
is relatively high.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It's like the tacit understanding

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
between the defense team

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
and the state government.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Basically,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
they will hold a hearing

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
to determine

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
whether the person

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
is mentally ill

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
or not.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The second strategy

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
is the litigation strategy.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Lastly,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I'd like to thank

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
my collaborators

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
and the RAs

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
who helped me

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
code my lawsuit.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
We're still

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
looking at these

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
long-term death warrant

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
and we're still

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
looking at these long-term

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
death warrant

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and the MakeAuthors Foundation

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
has been focusing on

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
the research on mental illness

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and death.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Is there any possibility of

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
racial inequality?

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
That's all

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
for my presentation

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
and I'd like to see

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
if there are any questions.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Thank you.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I'll start with Ian.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Thank you, Ian.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
This is not my area

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
but I've learned a lot.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I'd like to ask

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
if there are any questions

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
for Ian.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I'm happy to ask questions.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I'm curious

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and this might not

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
have much to do with

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
your presentation

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
but I'm curious

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
how the US

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
identifies

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
mental illness

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
when it comes

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
to death warrant.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
For example,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
how much

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
mental illness

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
does this person

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
need?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
How do they

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
consider this?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I don't know

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
much about the US.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
The US court system

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
is not the same as Taiwan.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
They have a national judge

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
for public prosecution.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I'm using the term

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
from Taiwan.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I'm curious how they

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
consider these things.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Currently,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
there are a few

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
institutions

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
that have tried to

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
provide guidelines.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
The guidelines are similar

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
to the ones

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
provided by

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
psychiatrists and psychologists.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
First,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
each state has different

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
qualifications.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
There are no rules

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
for each state.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
For example,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
how many people

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
can be identified?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It's a mess.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
For example,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
there are two psychiatrists

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
in Texas.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
They need to

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
write their own

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
professional report.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
They need to write

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
their diagnosis

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
according to

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
DSM-5.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
The rest is left

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
to the judge.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
This is an interesting

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
aspect.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
There are a lot of judges

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
with serious

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
visual impairments

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and delusions.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Some people succeed,

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
some people fail.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I don't know why

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
we need to look at

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
so many factors

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
to determine

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
the outcome.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
In Taiwan,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
there are no

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
cases like this.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I'd like to ask

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
about mental

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
disorders.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
This is related

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
to the third example,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
which is about

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
medicine.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
You said it's related to

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
people in prison

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
for a long time.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I'm thinking

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
that

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
people in prison

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
for a long time

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
are sentenced

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
to death.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
After a long period

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
of time,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
it's normal.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
For example,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
what's the mechanism

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
for them to

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
apply for

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
this kind of

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
sentence?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Is it

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
impossible to

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
enforce?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It's rare.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Most cases

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
require

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
the person to be

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
transferred to

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
a medical institution.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It's rare.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
The reason is that

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
the death penalty

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
is stricter

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
than the death penalty

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
in the United States.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's not easy

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
to get the person out of prison.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
In fact,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
thousands of people

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
in the United States

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
are waiting for death

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and unable to

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
get help.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
That's why

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
the so-called premature

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
is used

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
to determine

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
whether the person

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
has the ability

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
to survive

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
for a long time.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
It's to

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
determine whether

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
the person

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
has the ability

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
to survive

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
for a long time.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Most people

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
are in prison.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Most people

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
are in prison.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Is prison

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
different from other prisons?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Is prison different from other prisons?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
It depends on the state.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Some states have

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
so-called heavy prisons.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Heavy prisons may have

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
one death cell.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
For example,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Texas or California

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
may have thousands of people

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
in death cells.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
They may have

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
all death cells

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
in prison.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Heavy prisons

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
are more common.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Some states have

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
fewer death cells.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
They may be in

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
more independent prisons.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
It depends on the state.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I think it's interesting.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I don't know if

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
they are still different.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Except for

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
all death cells,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
what about

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
other prisoners?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
What about other prisoners?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
It depends on the state.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Some states

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
have

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
heavy prisons.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Some states have

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
heavy prisons.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It also depends on the state.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Some states

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
have more open prisons.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
They have fewer

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
medical resources.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Some states have

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
no prisoners.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Some states have

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
many prisoners.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Some states have

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
no prisoners.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
They are waiting for death.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
It's not like

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
there are no prisoners.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
The treatment is different.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
The prison is different.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
The prison is free.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It has minimum

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
guarantees.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
They are waiting for death.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
In theory, they can't use

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
too much resources.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
But there are many people in the US

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
and their policies are changing.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It's weird.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Some people have been

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
in prison for years

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
but they are not dead.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It's awkward.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It's not certain.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
It's a complicated

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
situation.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Yes.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Any other questions?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Any other questions?

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Any other questions?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Any other questions?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
No.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Thank you for the wonderful report.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I'm looking forward to

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
your coding.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I was thinking

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
to do a Lenten class analysis

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
to see

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
whether the prisoners

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
are successful or not.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Their backgrounds

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and profiles

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
are different.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I'm looking forward to

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
your analysis.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I hope we can

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
finish coding soon.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Thank you, Annie.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Thank you, Gao Xian.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's comfortable

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
to talk about

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
heavy topics.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I think the topics

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
are sensitive.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
The ability to save lives

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
is the last

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
decision

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
to be made.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
It's a complicated decision.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm glad

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
to have the audience

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
here today.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Thank you, Annie.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Thank you, Annie.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Thank you for the wonderful

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
presentation.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Thank you for staying up

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
to listen to our

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
presentations.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Thank you.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I hope

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Annie,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
next year

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
you can

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
tell us

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
about your research.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
OK.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'll share it

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
with you.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Thank you.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Good night.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Good morning.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Good afternoon.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Thank you.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Bye-bye.
