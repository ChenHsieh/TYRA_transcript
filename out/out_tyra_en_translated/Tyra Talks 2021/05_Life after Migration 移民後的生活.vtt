00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Let me start by introducing Annie.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Annie completed her Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Sydney, Australia last year.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
She is currently a Senior Research Officer at the University of Technology Sydney,

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
working closely with the Associate Dean of Indigenous Land and Justice Research Hub.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
Before completing her Ph.D., Annie was awarded a Master by Research and a Master of Cultural Studies

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
with Gender and Cultural Studies, also at the University of Sydney.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Her research interests include human geography, labor and spouse immigration, urban planning,

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
circular migration in the South Pacific, resource and livelihood,

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
Southern Asian studies, rural economics, Australian aid, the end of the user experiences,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
remittances, and substantial development.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Annie is fluent in English, Mandarin, Tartoon, and Taiwanese.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's start with Annie.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Thank you.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
I'd like to go over my topic for today.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
My topic is Life After Migration, Migration, Urbanization, and Mobility in Geography.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
Geography is the capital of a country called Timor-Leste.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
You can see a cute little house on my PowerPoint.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
According to Taiwanese, it's a traditional sacred house.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
When I was still doing my Ph.D.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I lived in the Far East for about seven months.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
I worked there from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
As the host mentioned, I speak Tartoon.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Many of my interviews were done in English plus Tartoon.

02:13.000 --> 02:21.000
After I returned to Australia, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sydney.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
I went to UTS, the University of Sydney Technology, as a Senior Research Officer.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
In the U.S., I would be considered an Assistant Researcher or Assistant Professor.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
But in Australia, we have a clear distinction.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So I only do research.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I didn't teach this semester.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
So I don't call myself a professor.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
In Australia, we have professors, assistant professors, and professors.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
We don't have an assistant professor.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
So we have lecturers, senior lecturers, and associate professors.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
As you can see from my PowerPoint,

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm going to talk about East Taiwan and Australia.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
I know that most of our listeners are in Taiwan or the U.S.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
So you may not know much about the South Pacific.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
I think this is what makes lecturing valuable.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
It shows us that there are different possibilities in life.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Of course, it's still a research topic.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So I'm still going to talk about what I'm studying.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
What is my method?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
From a geographical perspective,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
what's the point of living there for seven months?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
What else did I discover?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
So the first point I'm talking about is resource management.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So why is it useful to do research in this small country?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Is it useful for Australia or Taiwan?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Or is it useful for them?

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
My Ph.D. was covered by an Australian aid program.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Australian aid is the same as U.S. aid.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
Australian aid was used to assist the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Taiwan used to receive aid.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
We used to have U.S. aid.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So it's a miracle for Taiwan's economy.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
But we can think about whether we can replicate this in other countries.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Or what direction can Taiwan's aid be in the future on the South Pacific?

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
So I'm going to talk about its resources.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
My PowerPoint has oil.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And it's very young.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And you can't find a job in the local area.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
That's the point of today.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Remittances is right.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
As long as it's a private loan, it's called remittances.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It's different from A.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
A is government-to-government agreement.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
But remittances can be sent from Australia to Boxuan for $100.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This is remittances.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
So a lot of people would like to send people abroad to work or study.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
And there are a lot of natural resources in the local area.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
So there's coconut, palm oil, and coffee.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
So my first point is that there are a lot of Australian aid projects.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
One of them is the Australian Seasonal Workers Program that I did.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
It's very similar to the plan for Taiwanese to go to Australia for holiday work.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
But the biggest difference is that Taiwanese or Australians are free to go to Australia for holiday work.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Because they're holiday workers.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But this is a South Pacific island.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Only workers from countries supported by Australia can come.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
They're government-to-government agreements.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So it's a bit like our diplomatic model plan.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So workers are actually treated very well in Australia.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Because this is the face of the country.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
And it's government-to-government agreements.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So if Taiwanese go to Australia for holiday work,

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
you have to find a job, find a house, apply for a visa, and do everything yourself.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
But if it's a Pacific islander, like Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and my Timorese workers,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
they're already set up.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Everything's set up for you.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
All you have to do is fly over.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
So that's a very different thing.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
And they often have ambassadors from Pacific islands to see the workers.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Make sure they are treated very well.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
This is a big difference.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
So a lot of people, because of the support of this plan,

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
they can buy land or build a house when they return to their home country.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Or a lot of islanders like to party.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
So a lot of it is spent on the maintenance of social networks.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
The third and final point I want to talk about is

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
what I find challenging.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
As a woman, and as you can see, I'm not white.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But I'm from Australia.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm Australian, I'm Taiwanese, I'm Hakka.

07:41.000 --> 07:50.000
So this is how I negotiated my positionality.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Of course, sometimes it's boring when you first go.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And basically, as long as they see you as a woman,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
they'll think you're a high-ranking wife or something.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
They won't respect me as a professor.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Sexism and xenophobia.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
This is what I'm talking about.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
In fact, a lot of Pacific islanders have Chinese roots.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
But how do Chinese people get along with them locally?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
That will actually affect how they see my role.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
Or I'll talk about how I often walk on the road and get touched by children.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Or pull my hair or something.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
But I can speak local dialect.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So when I use local dialect to scare them, they'll be surprised.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Oh, this foreigner can speak local dialect.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And he seems to be from Australia.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They're scared when they see someone from Australia.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Because the role of Don Lee-Woon is very ambiguous.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
He's a bit of an Australian colonial enemy.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
So I'll talk a little bit about the history of Don Lee-Woon and Australian roles.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So we need to know where T-Mall is.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Where is Australia?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
So you may have no problem with geography in this regard.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Where is Australia?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
This is a map of the United States.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
So the size of Australia is actually about the same size as that of the United States and Canada.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Don Lee-Woon is on this small island in the north.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
It's a very small island.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
It's between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
It's actually very small.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It's smaller than Taiwan.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
But the complexity of its population is actually similar to that of Taiwan.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Because it has a mountainous terrain.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
It's quite similar to Taiwan.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Mountainous.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
And there are only two seasons, dry season and rainy season.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I was so happy when I went there in August.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It's about 40 degrees every day.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
By November or December, like now, it's rainy season.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
You go out every day like this to pick water.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
In such a situation, it also has a lot of products.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Because there is a lot of rainwater, you can grow anything you want to live.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
So there are a lot of things.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'll pick a few first.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
The first one is why I did this PhD.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Because Australians think it's important.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Because there is oil in the back garden of Australia.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So you can see it on this map.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Australia is here.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And then there's a small island on top of it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It's Papua New Guinea.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Next to it is Indonesia.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
So it's about the 17th century.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The Portuguese came and took over Papua New Guinea.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And then it's been there for over 300 years.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Basically, the number of buildings is not very large.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
If I want to be more diplomatic.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
The Portuguese brought them nothing but singing, dancing, Latin names and Catholicism.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
There's not even a railway.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And they didn't build a university.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
So in fact, the Portuguese are the characters over there.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I want your sandals.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm the sandalwood.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
The locals used to talk about sandalwood, but now they don't.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I don't want to do a lot more construction.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
But in the post-Papua New Guinea colonial era.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
It was from the 1960s to the 1970s.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Natural gas was discovered in the East.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
It's the kind of natural gas that you can light up in your backyard.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Natural gas floats up from the ground like this.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Of course, the Portuguese didn't have the Renaissance Revolution.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
So I don't want to be able to pick it up.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
But they found a lot of Indonesian businessmen who were actually very interested.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Australia is also very interested.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
The United States is also very interested.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
In the end, Indonesia's stronghold next to it was occupied by Dongding in 1975.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And then Australia signed a contract with Indonesia and said,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Hey, let's open the Timo Sea Oil below you, okay?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
That's their cooperation.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
But because Indonesia was independent in 1975 to 2002.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
There's construction between 25 years.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
There's a university and there's a lot of scholarships.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
And then there's actually a little bit of the whole domestic economy of Dongding.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
There's a construction infrastructure.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
But he killed a lot of people after all.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
In the 1992 massacre in Santa Mascara.

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
The issue of human rights in Dongding caused strong interest in the international community.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Yes, of course, in the end, Indonesia was there.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Ah, there's no way to go on.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
And then the United Nations sent troops.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
So, in 1999, they had the world's first record.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It's an independent referendum.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
And then it was decided that a lot of people who were close to 99% decided to be independent.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We want our own country.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
We don't want to be a province in Indonesia.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
So they're independent.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
So, from 1999 to 2000, the UN sent troops.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Most of the people in the UN are American or Australian.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
So Australia and his ambiguous relationship has been going on for a long time.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
But now it's officially the UN sent troops.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
So what about the oil treaty between Indonesia and Australia?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
So they're renegotiating the bond.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
And then it becomes the oil of Dongding and all kinds of natural resources start to be exploited.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
And maybe there's a bigger chance that they're going to let their own people manage their own resources.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
So then they set up a team.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Petroleum fund.

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
It's about putting the oil revenue into the country's reserve fund.

14:10.000 --> 14:18.000
In Taiwan, it's called redistribution fund.

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
And then we're going to talk about whether or not the money has been used properly.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And then there's the whole situation of the people's livelihood.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
But in addition to oil, they have pretty good coffee.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes, I put a picture of Fairtrade's Timor-Leste coffee.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And a lot of coconut.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
There's a province in the east called Los Barros.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
They produce a lot of good quality coconut.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
And I put the Dongding sea water I shot there.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Their sea water is really clear.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I haven't been to Palau.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
But I heard from some of my friends who have been to Palau.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
He said that the feeling of looking under the Dongding sea water is similar to that of Palau.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's very beautiful and pollution-free.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
So it's actually very rich in marine resources.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And then there's the most important resource.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I think it's also about determining whether or not this country can develop the most important resource, which is people.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's take a look at the demography of Timor-Leste.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Look at the population.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
It looks very young.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Most people are under the age of 25.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
When I was in the Dongding sea water, I was over 30 years old.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
But young people over the age of 10 are at a loss.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
But if someone looks very old, like over 50 years old.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
It will be respected by the local community.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Because we can see that there is a gap between the population pyramid 35 to 39.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Then we can push it back a little bit.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
They had a war more than 20 years ago.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
At that time, it was those 18-year-old men who were going to serve in the military.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Usually quite a lot of people died on the battlefield.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So now they are about 40 years old.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Then there is the population pyramid.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
It is in the age bracket of 35 to 45 years old.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
There will be a shortage.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
So because there was a civil war before.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
So a lot of people just can't do it.

16:30.000 --> 16:38.000
In this situation, develop their own personal economy.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Or the development of life.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Basically caused a lot of problems.

16:46.000 --> 16:54.000
Then we are going to talk about the role of Australia in the development of the East China Sea.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
Because I just said that there are Chinese people in the East China Sea.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So basically 75 years ago.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Many Chinese people in the East China Sea came to Taiwan to study.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Because at that time they were members of the Republic of China.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
And there is a consulate in Dili.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Because they are part of Portugal.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
At that time, Portugal had diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
So from the founding of the Republic of China to 1975.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
In fact, the relationship between Taiwan and East China Sea has always been very good.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
A lot of people came to Australia because of the war.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Most of them are Chinese.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
50%.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Most Chinese people in East China Sea are very good.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And rich.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
So at that time, they could either choose to go to Taiwan to study.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Then a lot of people went to Taiwan to study.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Then apply for a refugee visa to Australia.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Or some people settled directly in Taiwan.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Not necessarily.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
So now there is a census in Australia.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I mean they are Australian.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
They are Australian citizens.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
Or permanent residents.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Just like there are green cards in the United States.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
There are about 10,000 people.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Of course, there are a few workers.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Or people who study abroad.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
These may not be included in the census.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
But Australia has always had a very close relationship with the East China Sea.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
So when we talk about immigration theory.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Excuse me.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
You just said 10,000 people.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Is this a high proportion of the population of East China Sea?

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes, because the population of East China Sea is only 1.3 million.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Oh, OK.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Almost 1% of the population.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Yes, almost 1% of the population are in Australia.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
So Australia is very important to them.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Like me and the East China Sea Embassy in Sydney.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
It's a very good relationship.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
The Embassy may come to me for a cup of coffee.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So they will say.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
They usually send people to Australia.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Must be looking for the best, the highest level.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Just like Taiwan sent to Washington.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Is a peak of your diplomatic career.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
So what we are talking about in immigration theory.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Migration has a push and pull factor.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Is that push and pull.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
What is your birthplace?

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
How bad is it to let you send you out?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Or the place you moved to.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Like the United States or Australia.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
How good is it to let you stay?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So what I'm talking about in this PowerPoint.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Is it the push and pull factor of the East China Sea?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
We can take a look.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Because it's not very urbanized.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
31%

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And this is last year's data.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So 31% means.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
70% of people actually live in rural areas.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
So think about it.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
If you are Taiwanese.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
What was Taiwan like more than 40 years ago?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
That feeling.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Maybe more than 40 years ago.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Taiwan's literacy level may be a little higher.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
A little bit.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't have that data.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Then they have a very important reason.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Is the young unemployed population.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Because there are really not too many buildings on the island.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
So if you go to college.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
They now have about 7 specializations.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Plus college.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But after going to college.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Do you want to find a job?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
The unemployment rate is 12.3.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
The unemployment rate in Australia.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
The overall unemployment rate.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
It's very high after COVID.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Our very high is only 6%.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Then this country.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The unemployment rate on the island is 12.3%.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Then his population is only.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
1.3 million.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And most of it is a very young population.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It's the middle of the year.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Because of the war.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
There is no.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Their minimum wage.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
$150 a month.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Is to do labor work.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
I can only make about $5,000 a month.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
But their official currency.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It's in US dollars again.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Because there is no ability to.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
There is no central bank to issue their own currency.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So it's in US dollars.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Then a dollar or less.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
There's that little coin.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
It's called Saint.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's Portuguese.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Saint.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
They were in 2002.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
After independence.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And then there's something like that.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The civil war.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
It's a little bit of an Indian.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
With that one.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
A little bit of a local.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And there may be people from Australia.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
There's a little bit of a conflict.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So that's in 2006.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Plus they're actually.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
In 2014.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
With Australia.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Because of the oil.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And there's a hearing.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
That's right.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Because I'm not a political expert.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So I'm not going to go into detail.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But we can find out.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
It's a big problem.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So I'm going to repost.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So we.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So many resources.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
How does it help the development of this country?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Or is it just a resource curse?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
There's oil, but.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
It's like oil revenue.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's not owned by the people.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Economic development is not up.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
So then later.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
The Australian government did something.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Just like I just said today.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Australian seasonal workers program.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
To put this.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
The diplomatic.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It should be said that the diplomatic.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Political ambition.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
With the purpose of economic development.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Wrap it up into one.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Is that it can make both sides.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Can accept the immigration plan.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So what about this plan?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I have a net.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And this one on top is mine.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
He's in one.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
He's in one.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
He's probably.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Because because the islanders.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
They don't have that many people.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Can go to college.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So as long as this plan has.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
You can join when you're in high school.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
That might be 18 to 45 years old.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
That's going to be very capable.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
So they're going to have some physical tests.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's like Kang.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It's not Kang Sabao.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
But it's a little bit like jumping.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Something like that.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Can be that.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And then there's the hospital.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I just realized.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I'm going to Australia.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Is to the farm or.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Because it's a diplomatic plan.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So it's not the same as the resort.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
They can go to some.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Places on the Australian coast.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
There's a place in the northwest of Australia.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
You can have that.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
The industry.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So it's like that.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Remote hospitality.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
They can actually do it too.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
There's a pretty big one.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
The focus is on me.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Talking about it.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Australia is the first world.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So if it's a job search.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Like me.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I can only have my name.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
But if today.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Assuming my last name is changed.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I might be Chinese.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And then your application.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I'm not going to put up a picture.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You can only have your academic experience.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
In order to avoid that.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Right.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The discrimination of competitors.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
But if this plan.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
It allows you to do overseas recruitment.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That's a big deal.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It's a big deal.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So they can do it.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Any kind of test.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
What kind of people do they want to pick?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Go to Australia to work.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Those who want to use.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Want to join this government.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Plan.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Approve employer.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
They have to pay.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Those migrant workers' visas.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Residence.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And air tickets.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Although it's still deducted from their salary.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
We call it deduction.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But this is basically.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
There will be a lot of convenience.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You can actually.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
If I'm the owner.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I can pick anyone I want.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And those in Australia.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The law may be very unauthorized.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Like this.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You can't have pregnant people.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Or.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
People who used to do business.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It's in there.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
But this is in Australia.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Local laws are not allowed.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
If someone is pregnant or married.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
If you resign.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
The government will shut down.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
But this is basically.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You can do a lot of tricks.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
In this situation.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
This plan.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
A lot of migrant workers.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
The islanders.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
They are all very.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I should say it's a local business.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
There is also an implication.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
The Australian government also hopes.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
We are the best on the island.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
They should be able to contribute to the local community.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Help this country.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Can develop.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So I made a picture here.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
These workers may be.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
In.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Regional Australia in the Australian countryside.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
What do you do?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And then the money.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
He might just send it back.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
To his wife and children.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
They will build a house there.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And then raise some pigs.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Or buy some farmland.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
The so-called economic effect.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
From just a family.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Expand to a whole community.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
With a whole country.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
This is their original expectation.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But we can look at this thing.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Is it feasible?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Because people.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
You can't put the money.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Give the money to others.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It has nothing to do with you.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
So this project must be big enough.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Its impact will be big enough.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Because I won't just send money to me.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
A stranger.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I might just give it to my brothers and sisters.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
To my family.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
So this thing.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
We will talk about the so-called academic.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
We will say it is a.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Bottom-up approach.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Not that top-down.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But also these two.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Approach.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
At the same time there is that power.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So the development of this country.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It may only rise.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But we can see that his current ratio is still.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
31% still in Petroleum.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
With oil.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Then 26% in natural gas.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
22% in coffee.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Is raw coffee.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Then there are some other things.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Basically it is very small.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Then I said.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I was doing research at the beginning.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I do household survey.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Then a local family.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
There are probably 11 or 12 people.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Imagine 45 years ago in Taiwan.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Because they are every.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Because women will be born.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Seven children in a lifetime.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
If you see three or four.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That may be a senior official.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Pressure or something.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Maybe three or four are very few.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So I was.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
A total of 52 families interviewed.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Then there are about 11 or 12 people in each.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
If the child does not count.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I just do one.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Similar to the focus group.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
The nationality.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Then ask them.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Asked some questions.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
May be.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Because I mainly want to know.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
How do they spend money?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
What did you buy?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Something like that.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I also chased those workers.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
From the countryside of Australia.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
This is me.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Field map.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
In Kunshan in the north.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Because Australia is a basketball.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So our north is a tropical.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I remember that time.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I drove for a long time.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Maybe half an hour.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I did not see anything.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Australia is very big.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
After 25 minutes.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I only see nothing.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
In the middle of nowhere.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
They may live next door.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Accommodation.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
That's it.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That kind of house.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Six months back once.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Six months back to the east.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
So I was.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I was studying for a PhD.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Second year or third year.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I just followed them.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
About six or seven months.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Then use WhatsApp and Facebook.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Contact them.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
When they are ready to go home.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Very simple.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I just followed them home.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
So I can know.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
What do they use money for?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
So the result I got later.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Where did they spend the money?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I came to a conclusion.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Basically.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
36% of people.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Spend the money on.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Build a house.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
This is easy to understand.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Because.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Their traditional house.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's a straw house.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I really think the straw house is great.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It's very cool to live there.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
It's a bit like Taiwan.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
The traditional house.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You are the kind of tropical area.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Of course it's a straw house.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
But if it rains.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Make a big water.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
The straw house is washed away.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
So they still basically.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Want to build that kind of western style.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Big house.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Then there are tropical colors.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Maybe the most is orange.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Red and green.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Then there will be 27% of people.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Want to do business.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Then I basically.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Three or four days ago at the National University of Australia.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
There is another online conference.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Then there are many.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Development practitioners will say.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
How do they use western ideas.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Think about it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
These islanders should take the money.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Then we should teach them how.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Financial literacy.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
This is very.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Western colonialist view.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I teach you how to use money.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Then I said at that time.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Say.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
No one is going to work for someone else.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Once they come back from Australia.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
That's it.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
You have been working so hard in Australia.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And there are white people.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Not necessarily white people.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Is the boss.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Then why do you come back?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Still continue to work for white people.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Or what kind of person is Australian?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Many people want to come back.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I just want to be my own boss.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So this is basically.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I think it's a great market.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
They will be.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Can take this money.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Some people are from Indonesia.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
There are many small and medium-sized businesses in Southeast Asia.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
There are some people who are because of war.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
May be young.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Their younger sibling.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
There is no way to complete education.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So many of them.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Also invest in education.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Will send.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Will send their younger brothers and sisters.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Go to Indonesia to study.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Because actually.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
As you know.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
The nearest western country there.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It is Australia, New Zealand.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But the tuition is really expensive.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
That is a year.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
It is also 40,000 to 50,000 US dollars.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
That.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Go to other places.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Asian countries like Singapore.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The competition is too big.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Taiwan did not provide scholarships.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
The most convenient is Indonesia.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
So many people have mentioned.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They want to go back to college.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
May be going to Indonesia.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
We may feel in Taiwan.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It is a very advanced country.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
But after all.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That is also the Northeast.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So Indonesia for them.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
In fact, the level of development is also very high.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And it is a very good choice.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So many people.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
In addition to these three.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Build a house and do business.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Also invest in education.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Many people also bought it.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I bought some pigs in the countryside.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Domestic animals.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Basically more pigs.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Or chicken.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Or cash crops.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Mango trees.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Many people buy banana trees.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Mango trees.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And coconut.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Some are quite a lot.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Sorry.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Can you go back to the top?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I have two questions.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
The first one is.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
These are all interviews, right?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I saw the data.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
All interviews.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
In fact, I also double verify.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Because many times.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
What they want to do with him.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Not the same.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Because of me.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Only through Western Union.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It's Australia.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I actually have an Australian.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The office asked for the approximate value.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Then I asked again.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Then I went to the interviewer.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Can you show me what you bought?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What did you buy?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Because I still have a point.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Many people tell me.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
He bought a chicken.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Do business.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
In fact, he went to sell chickens.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Because they fight chickens.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
There is a girl who told me.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
How much did he spend?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
When I went home to count.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
6,000 less.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
So where did he spend 6,000?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
You ask him directly.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Where is the missing 6,000?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's embarrassing.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
The next day, his friend invited me to drink coffee.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
When I was working.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
With a special man.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Come back to have a baby.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Not his husband.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
So the 6,000 dollars.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
In fact, it was a baby born in Australia.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
It's too embarrassing.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
He didn't want to tell me.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I said OK.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
So I spent about 3,000.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Understand.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Another question.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Because this is like.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Is it back from Australia?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
So it's a bit like.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I don't know if this question is right.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
For those who are already.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
For these local families.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
It's like this.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So it's like this.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The ratio of income.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Is it also applicable to the general.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The ratio of income they originally had.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It should be said that.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
The way they use this money.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
It's different from the way they usually use money.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Or are they using the same.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Almost the same ratio.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
This question.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
You really know how to ask questions.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
I think this is worth it.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
1 million questions.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Because basically the islanders.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Do you know that their salary is very low?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
So 150 dollars.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Basically, this money is for them.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Windfall fell from the sky.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Sit down money.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And a lot of people in the countryside.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
They don't need money.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
You have to imagine that Taiwan.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Even in the 50s and 60s.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
They actually don't need money.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Because they are obligated.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It's said that there is often that.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
We drove by.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
My colleague is a documentary director.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
He will talk a lot.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Hey, that sister.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I use candles to exchange corn with you, OK?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So they are basically still.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
A lot of rural people are in the original economy.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
So this money is for them.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Some of my workers.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
They are.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Sent 6,000 yuan.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
6,000 dollars back.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That's very big for them.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
It's completely zero money.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
The gift that fell from the sky.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Because they used to be.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
What do you eat?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Maybe 100 times a month.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
There is no such system.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
So this is extra.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
In addition to their livelihood system.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Can you answer this?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because I will ask these two questions.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
In fact, there is one in economics.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
A very important theory.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
If you say today.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Maybe your income today.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You may use this ratio to spend.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Then if you say today.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Give you 100 more.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It's like a hundred dollars that fell from the sky.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
How do you make a choice?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
It is very possible that you will spend a sum of money.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
To invest or a sum of money.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
When you get it.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Just spend it all.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
You may want to save it.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Let you in the future.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Have a certain consumption.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So that your consumption can be smooth.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Let your overall life level go up.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
But this thing is not always.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
There should be some information.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
But not like this.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
A very good piece of information.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Because this state.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
For us, it may be okay.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
But for the locals.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
This may be a big state.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
How do you use it?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
If the quality of the information is very good.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
In fact, it is quite suitable.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
So I will ask like this.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So I feel very curious.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Really.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
So we see this pie chart.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
In fact, I asked.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
They did not mention buying food or what.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Because you usually want to buy food.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You go to kill your backyard chicken.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Or you go.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Use candles to exchange for corn.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
All they talk about is.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I took this.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Is to build a house.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I bought a car.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Or what.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Then they did not even talk about buying a mobile phone.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
At that time I was.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Fortunately, you asked.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I asked.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Don't a lot of people buy iphone?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Or what.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Then I found out.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I really live in the local area.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I found out.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I really ask.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
You are too naive.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
You know their network is super bad.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And everyone wants to buy that phone card and network.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Then they bought a mobile phone.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
So a lot of people say.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
He may be working here.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
He wants to talk to his girlfriend.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
He wants to buy a mobile phone for him.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
A smart phone for his girlfriend.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
But this is not a remittance.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
It's because they've been working in Australia for a long time.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I bought it.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So those are gifts.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
They brought it all back.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
What rice cooker.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I was wondering why.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
No electronic device.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
But they actually bought it first.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
So these are the ones.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Because these are the ones that can only be used locally.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
So yeah.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
This is probably.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And then later.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I've been living there for a long time.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I'll find out.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
They're actually in the process of urbanization.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
There are quietly going on.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Although they are urbanized.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
About 30 percent.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
About 70 percent.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Most of them still live in the countryside.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
But in fact.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
This transition is also happening.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
From that general.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
They actually have one.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
The only shopping center in the country.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
It's called Timo Plaza.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
It's a bit like when I was still in Taiwan.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
When I was in fifth or sixth grade.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
My hometown is Taichung.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I go to the first square.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
It was about 20 years ago.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
The level of Taichung's first square.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I don't know what other areas are.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
There are some.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Chinese businessmen from other places.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Come over there to sell some small things.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Or goods or something.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So basically a lot.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
But most of them are.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Because of the war.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So a lot of that.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The road is the whole.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
It was when the UN army came.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Get rid of it.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
So a lot of countries like Japan.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
JICA.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
What exchange association.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I helped them in.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
There are also Koka in Korea.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
China's Belt and Road.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Also fixed a lot.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Of course there is.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
USA in the United States of America.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Also have this.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So there are gradually roads in the countryside.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
But this is a very sticky situation.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
They have a road but no streetlights.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So I really.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
It was a long adventure for me at the time.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
If I go out at night.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I have to have a flashlight.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Otherwise it's pretty dangerous.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That's another one.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I think it makes me feel even more.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
A big change is because.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
According to Marx's theory.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Capital transfer.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Also.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
How do you get the capital.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
To support you.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Your own activity.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
The change.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
To see the change of this era.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So they also started from.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Sell ​​small things in the market.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Also advanced.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
That is to say.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Maybe it's like a sales service.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Like the one on my right.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
There are buses.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
So their buses.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
This service is only available in the capital.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
If I was going to the countryside.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I have to take a truck.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It's really a truck.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Then.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Because I'm a foreigner.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
There will be some goods on the truck.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Like this.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
If you want to take a truck.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You have to do it with the chicken and the sheep.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
So I will.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
If you use the power of money.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Then give me two more dollars.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I can sit next to him.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I don't have to.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Travel with animals.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Of course.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
These workers.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
A lot of money.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
$6,000, $7,000, $10,000.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
A lot in the local area.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I asked the least.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
It's the kind.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
He's not quite used to Australian life.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's the first season.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
He might only have 3,000.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
But if it's the kind.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I've been to Australia four or five times.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
They're very good.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
They can save a year.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
One season is six or seven months.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It's close to $20,000.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I want to say I'm a university professor.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I can't save that much.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I'm a moonlight group.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
If you go back, you're basically considered.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's a new father's class.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
So this.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
This is actually in.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
In fact, in terms of local people.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
This will break.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Break some.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Maybe that person.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
He's usually in.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Uh, in the local society.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
His original class.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
It's not that.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And then he might go back.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
With a lot of money.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Like Taiwan said.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Explosive or greedy.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
It's just that feeling.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It's also a lot.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Uh, in the local area.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's a hot topic.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Like I went to the countryside for an interview.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They want to say.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So that means I'm here to ask you.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Can I get into that?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
They'll be right.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
This thing is really going abroad to work.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Create an Australian dream.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
This thing can be.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It's a way to make me rich in an instant.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
But in fact.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
When I was doing the interview.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I'll find out.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
A lot of people.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I want to pursue this Australian dream.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
But in the end, you're done.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
We can see him build a house.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Progress.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Some people may be more.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
So he might have gone.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Two seasons.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
About 10,000.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
And then the house on the left.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Just build a small house.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
But some people may be ambitious.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Or what?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Like this house.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That's the backyard of our house.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
He also went to Australia.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But because it seems like only one season.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Or what?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
It's just that the money hasn't been sent back.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
The whole house is embarrassing.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
So his house has no roof.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
He can only live on the first floor.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
The second floor has not been returned because of the money.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
And then maybe my wife is.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
The second floor has no roof.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
The whole house can't be built.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So this is actually.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
There is the so-called.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
That kind of meeting effect.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
But the meeting effect.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Is there really that much?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Or can it always be a continuous thing?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It is also necessary to see.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Or there is.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
In Taiwan, we are in the Japanese era.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
There is self-love.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
But not in Tokyo until now.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
To my picture below.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
The picture is standing next to the Tokyo girl.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It's Australia and the Tokyo flag.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
This word is called Beirun.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Beirun means water well.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So the Australians donated a well here.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That's in the urban area.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
What are they doing in line?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
They are queuing for water.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Because only foreigners live.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Or high-ranking families.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
There is tap water.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
That's usually.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
A group of people is going to.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Water station.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Or the water tower to get water.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
What do they usually drink?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
They are the main water.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Or buy that kind of imported water.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I remember when I was there.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The first thing I wake up every morning.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I opened my faucet.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Because I was sitting.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
In the house of the British consul.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Then I opened the faucet.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
There is water.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I just put that pool of water.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I just.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
There is something like a piece of water.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Then I use that water all day.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
To brush your teeth.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Wash your face.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Then I go to the supermarket.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Buy water.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
So basically a lot of people.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
After working home.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
The first thing they see when they buy a house.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Like Taiwanese people look at the location.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Did you enter the train station?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
What is the bus station?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Their first preference.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Enter the water tower.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
There must be a well and a water tower next to it.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Because there is no tap water.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
This is also a very different thing.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Then I have this picture below.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
There is a German-Austrian geography.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Annual photography award.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
That is.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
They.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I was in the market at that time.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Take a truck to the side.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
When I was doing a rural interview.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I took a sneak shot.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Their truck is usually a bit like.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Thai song.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Or the Philippine tattoo.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Everyone will sit in the back.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Then the driver sits in front.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Then there is no sign or anything.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
So you just follow the water.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
But my interviewee.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
When he came back.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Bought a truck.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
He said he wanted to do this business.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Because in a public transportation.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
A very underdeveloped place.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You can move.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
In fact, to some extent.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
There is a way.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Generate more wealth.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Is to be able to let your.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Economic capital continues.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
A very important element.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Then here again.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Back to what I just said.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
In fact, some people may want to.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Come back and do business.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
What.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Some people do it.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Tourism industry.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
But their tourism industry is.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
There is an empty environment.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
It's very underdeveloped.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
It's not easy to go to Tokyo.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
There are only three places to fly.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
One is from Australia.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Darwin.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Darwin is a base.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It was a military base before.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That place.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And only Australia Airlines.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Qantas Air North.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Next is from Singapore.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
The last one is from Bali.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Bali is actually the most.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Most people fly.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Then I flew directly from Australia.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Then come back to Bali.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So the plane.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It's not easy to fly.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Very few tourists come.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
That is.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Domestic tourists.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
It's not enough to support this.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So they.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
The official has been telling me.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Can you write an article about tourism?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Let more people come.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I just want to say.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
But it's not like that.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The West will want to go to Tokyo.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
The feeling of spending money.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It's a big adventure.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
That kind of feeling.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Because they are actually like.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Many areas in Southeast Asia.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Fighters are banned.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We know that Indonesia is actually a.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Go home country.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
In addition to the fighters in Bali.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Other places will call the mayor.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
But the fighters in Tokyo.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Basically every day.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
That's their rule.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
The rule is.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I'll have a video later.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
The chicken will become.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Dinner that day.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
If you win the chicken.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Because they're in the chicken's leg.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Remember the chicken's leg.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
A knife.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
So if you lose, it becomes dinner.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Then if you win, you can.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Survive and then tomorrow.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Continue the next round tomorrow.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
So a lot of people are actually.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
In.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Get those things back.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
In addition to doing these meaningful things.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
A lot of people actually use it to gamble.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Or do something.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Make you happy.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Spend.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
But every time I'm with the West.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I'll say this.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
This is like our Melbourne car.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Go to SEMA.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
You go to a bar or something.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
But this is the local version.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Let's take a look.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Fighters.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Wait a minute.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
So let's take a look at the Fighters.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Wait a minute.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
That's what I put on the left.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It's a bucket shower.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I was in the east.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Ask how to take a shower.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
This is a bucket shower.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Fighters.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Wait a minute.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Wait a minute.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Wait a minute.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Wait a minute.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Wait a minute.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Let's talk about it.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Let's talk about it.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Yes.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
There was a chicken.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
A little accidentally picked.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
And then the chicken was left to the side for dinner.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I was on the left picture.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I am our sponsor.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Come back he opened the ghost.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Really like Taiwan 450 years ago.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You are just in that window that man.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
And tell the old lady.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Hey, what I want?

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Hey, I asked my woman that person bought something.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
She said she bought a bottle of gutebebe chili sauce and a envelope.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
So they are basically that kind of small particlularly.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
It's like this.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
The whole thing on the top is the shampoo.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Because they actually only have to go on a date.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
When is it?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
When do you wash your hair with shampoo?

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
That's why they usually take a shower.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I just use cold water.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
So when you wash your hair, you use a small bag.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And then because I'm a foreigner.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
So sometimes I go to visit our OZ corner.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
We have an Australian supermarket.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
See if we can buy Australian milk.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Then we'll see.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
These are our little friends.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
This is their daily game.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And then I just put some.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
I wrote some articles myself.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
If you are interested.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
And the Australian ABC has interviewed me.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Chinese experience.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
If you are interested, you can take a look.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Wow!

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
The black one next to it is a pig.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Their pigs are pretty thin.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Because people can't eat enough.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
So the pigs are also very thin.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Yeah.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
So that's about what I wanted to share today.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
If you have any questions.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
You are welcome to discuss it together.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Thank you everyone.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Thank you.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Annie's speech was really, really exciting.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I really think it's very, very interesting.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Then I want to ask.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
If the audience has any questions.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
You can ask them at this time.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Then.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Or this is good.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Because our speech is almost.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I can stop recording first.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Then everyone can be more free.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
If you want to ask questions, you can.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
If you are here, thank you again.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Annie's speech today.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Thank you.
