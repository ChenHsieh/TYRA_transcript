00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Today, we are honored to have Dr. Teng-Ting Yun with us to discuss today's lecture.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Today's topic is Data Crisis in Astronomy, Machine Learning Techniques to Galaxy Studies.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Before we start the lecture, let me introduce Teng-Yun first.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
Teng-Yun is now at the Center for Extragalactic Astronomy at Durham University in the UK.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
She is an astrophysicist.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
She got her bachelor's and master's degree in Taiwan.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Then she went to Nottingham, also in the UK, and got her doctorate.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
She got her doctorate last year.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
Her main interest is galactic evolution and formation.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
She is now focusing on machine learning techniques for galaxy study.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
In today's lecture, she will talk about her specialty, machine learning for galaxy study.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
She will also talk about her past work.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
She will also talk about how machine learning will help galaxy study in the future.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Now, let's welcome Teng-Yun with a round of applause.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Thank you, Chair, for the warm introduction.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Hello, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, and good night.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm Teng-Yun.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Durham University.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I'd like to apologize to everyone first.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I think I'm going to talk a lot in Chinese and English.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Because I can't show my speaker notes.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I usually speak in English.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
So my Chinese sometimes gets stuck.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
What I'd like to share with you today is about machine learning.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
It's becoming more and more popular in astronomy.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
This is a research topic for my postdoctoral research.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm going to share with you some papers I did in my postdoctoral research.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
What is an astronomer?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Basically, every time I tell everyone that I'm an astronomer,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
everyone has a different idea of what an astronomer is.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Most of the time, people will ask me,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Do you know what the meteorite of Saturn is?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Or people will point to a star in the sky and ask me,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Do you know what that star is?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I have to be honest and say I really don't know.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
If I tell people I'm a postdoctoral researcher,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
my mom will exaggerate and say,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Do you know that my daughter is a professor?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
It's not that exaggerated.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Mom, please calm down.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
If you are an astronomer or a theoretical astronomer,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
the most common thing we do every day is to use a computer.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
We're not writing code, we're debugging.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Especially what we do most often is data analysis.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
You may be analyzing certain stars.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Or like me, I'm analyzing big data.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
I may be analyzing hundreds of thousands or even millions of galaxies at a time.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm interested in two directions.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
One is information classification,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
which is Galaxy Morphological Classification.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
The other part is more cosmological.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I do Lama Napa Forest or IGN-CGN.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I don't know what this term means.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Because today I'm going to focus on information classification.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
It's relatively straightforward.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
This is the most famous information classification system.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It's categorized by human eyes.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It's called Hubble Sequence.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
It's a name given by a famous astronomer, Hubble.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Information classification can be divided into many types.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You can classify according to different brightness,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
or different degree of evolution,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
or even different information structures.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
Unfortunately, human eye classification is the most commonly used system in astronomy.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
We've been using Hubble Sequence for almost 100 years.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
As for big data,

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm showing you the data from various surveys in recent years.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
As you can see from the left side,

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
the data you can see in the astronomy survey is about 1TB.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
In the future, we expect to break through the 1TB scale.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
So we find that the data is growing very fast.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Because of computer technology, we can store a lot of data.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
But the problem is that in astronomy,

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
we can't handle such a large amount of data in a traditional way.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
We have data, but we can't handle it.

05:40.000 --> 05:50.000
Let me show you the big data.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Since 2005, SDSS has been a very famous large-scale field tracking program.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
It has observed about 50 million stars.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
But in fact, we've done a lot of analysis,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and we've done a lot of detailed research.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
There are only about 1 million stars.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
You know that the speed of our analysis is very, very slow.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
It's far less than the speed of our data generation.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
The most famous program in information classification is Galaxy Zoo.

06:29.000 --> 06:38.000
Galaxy Zoo is a program that invites people from all over the world to do information classification together.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Because you can imagine that information classification is actually a very straightforward thing.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
You can look at a star and see if it has a spiral.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Then you can analyze whether it is an elliptical star or a spiral star.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Galaxy Zoo thinks that people from all over the world can do this kind of thing.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
So they let the general public participate in this information classification program.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
But even if they gather people from all over the world to do this kind of analysis,

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
they only classified about 900,000 galaxies in about three years.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
So you know that if, for example, the data I'm doing right now is DAS data.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
The initial data for this part of the data is about 30 trillion galaxies.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
The analysis I did in my paper is about 2 trillion galaxies.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So you know that if we want to do it in a traditional way today,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
we need to analyze it in a human way.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Even if we do it in the way of Galaxy Zoo,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
you may not be able to finish it in your life.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So we need some help at this time.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
When we say we are in trouble, I always say I am in trouble.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
I can't do this kind of large-scale survey analysis because I have too much data.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
At this time, many people will start to seek help from machine learning.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
This is my topic today.

08:06.000 --> 08:21.000
Here you can see the recent paper on machine learning in astronomy.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
You can see that there has been an exponential growth in the past few years.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
More and more papers are doing related things.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
I started to read the textbook in 2017.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
When I was reading the textbook, I was very impressed.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
At that time, basically no one was doing it.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Everyone is just starting to do it.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
But after that, I will probably have a new paper every day.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
I will see a new paper every day talking about machine learning applications.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Let me talk about it.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
In astronomy, I think it's pretty much the same in computer science.

09:01.000 --> 09:14.000
Machine learning applications are roughly divided into supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Of course, there are other more detailed things.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I won't talk about it for the time being.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
This is a more general classification.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
I will talk about these three categories later.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So my talk today will be more technical.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
If you have any questions that you are not familiar with machine learning, you can ask me right away.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
It doesn't matter.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
In terms of applications, you can roughly divide it into three different questions.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
You can do classification, or you can do regression.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
You want to predict a continuous value.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Or you can do data generation.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
These are the things that machine learning can help with.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I basically have a list of these three.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
But I'm going to focus on the classification problem today.

09:57.000 --> 10:08.000
In terms of its purpose, most of the things we want to do in astronomy are what I just said.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Because we have a lot of data.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
But our traditional way of analyzing is far less than dealing with this data.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
The biggest problem is that we want to deal with efficiency issues.

10:20.000 --> 10:29.000
A large part of it is related to how we measure quantity.

10:29.000 --> 10:39.000
Machine learning can basically help us improve the accuracy of some measurements.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
So the two main purposes of machine learning are to improve efficiency and accuracy.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
But today, in addition to these two, I want to talk to you about what else we can do.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
What else we can do with machine learning?

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
You can be more creative when it comes to machine learning.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
To sum up what I just said, it's a long start.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm going to divide it into two parts today.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
The first part is very short.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
It's about how to improve efficiency and accuracy.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
The second part is about what else you can do.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm going to focus on unsupervised machine learning and self-supervised machine learning.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Let's go back to the very beginning, the Hubble sequence.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Let's simplify the problem now.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I don't know what you think of the Hubble sequence.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
But I'm going to try to explain it in a way that's not my area of expertise.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So my explanation is going to be a little more shallow.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
You can usually divide the Hubble sequence into two categories.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The elliptic sequence and the spiral sequence.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
It's very simple to classify them.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
There's the concept of a spiral coin.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't know if you can see my mouse.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Can you see my mouse?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
The spiral coin is very obvious.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
It's the shape of a spiral.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
As long as there's a spiral coin, we define it as a spiral sequence.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
The other is to define it as a elliptic sequence.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
So far, you can just say that it's a very straightforward, very simple thing to classify.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
So that's why Galaxy Zoo can get the public to help with this.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm sorry, can I ask a question?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I'd like to ask a naive question.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
Why are all the stars in the galaxy in the shape of a circle?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
Is there a possibility that they're in the shape of a triangle?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Yes, there is.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
As you can see, they're in the shape of a circle because of the projection.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
In fact, every star has a depth.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
In terms of elliptical stars, they're basically like a ball.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
They're like a ball in a triangular space.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
Their light distribution is also the shape of a ball.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
But if you look at a spiral star today, it's more like a disk.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So if you project it to 3D today,

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
the distribution of light will be more like a disk, not a ball.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
So this is also in the galaxy.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
So my question is, why are some of them in the shape of a disk,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
instead of a triangular elliptical shape?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
That's a good question.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
This question is mainly related to the evolution of stars.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
For example, this question is a bit difficult to answer.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
But it's mainly related to the evolution of stars.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Our current theory is that

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
we start with the spiral galaxy.

14:13.000 --> 14:22.000
How do I say it in Mandarin?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Can I speak English?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yes, you can.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
For spiral galaxies, they think that in the beginning,

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
you will have some gas that accretions into this structure.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's not like a ball.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It's more like a disk.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It's a flat disk.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
It's in the shape of an accretion disk.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It's not like a whole ball.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
It's not like a whole ball.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
In our understanding,

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
the main formation of stars should start from that.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
So in our understanding,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
the spiral galaxy is formed first.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Gradually, the two galaxies merge together.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
After the momentum dissipates,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
it slowly forms the shape of a ball.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Because the shape of a ball is more like an accretion disk.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Does this answer your question?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yes.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It's okay. We can discuss it later.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Okay.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
This part is actually quite long.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
It's not related to what I talked about today.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
The first part is supervised learning.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Let me tell you what supervised learning is.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Supervised machine learning is a very simple concept.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
We feed a picture to the machine.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Then we give it a label.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
For example, I tell the machine that this is a dog.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Then I tell it that this is a fried chicken.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Then I feed it a lot of pictures.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Pictures of different dogs and fried chickens.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
After the machine learns,

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
it will ask the dog if it is a dog or a fried chicken.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
This is the concept of supervised learning.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Supervised learning is a very common concept.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
In my 2020 paper,

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
I studied 10 different supervised machine learning algorithms.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Today I will focus on the Confluential Neural Network.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Let me briefly introduce the Confluential Neural Network

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
to those who are not familiar with machine learning.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
The idea is that we have Confluential Layers

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
to do feature extraction.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
What Confluential Layers is actually doing

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
is a bit like a filter concept.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
It actually wants to capture some features

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
that can best represent your image.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
When you want to produce these labels,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
what are the key points?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
What are the key points for the machine to make judgments?

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
Which part of this image is the key point for the machine to make judgments?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
In Confluential Layers,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
for example, the first layer has 6 channels.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Each channel uses different metrics.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Basically, it's a different filter concept.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
You will get 6 different images here.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
After passing the filter, you will get 6 different images.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Layer by layer,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
the machine will gradually learn

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
which part of the image is the most important part for you to make judgments.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
The machine will gradually learn this.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Let's look at the dog's side.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Here is a concept.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
This is a heat map to show which part is really worth paying attention to.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
The machine will ask,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
where is that part of attention?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
If you want to identify which part is worth paying attention to,

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
the machine will find out which part is worth paying attention to.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
The red part is where I need to pay attention to.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Next, they will input these extracted features

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
to fully connect layers.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
After this,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
they will connect all the features together

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
and use the softmax function

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
to give a probability concept.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
For example,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
if it's a dog or a cat,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
based on this probability,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
the machine can give a category.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
This is what the Confluential Neural Network is doing.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Now, let's look at the example of a dog and a fried chicken.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
In my example,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I input galaxy images.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
My image is from dark energy survey.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Based on this image,

19:01.000 --> 19:09.000
I use Galaxy Zoo's visual classification to train my machine.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Basically, I tell my machine,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
this galaxy is elliptical,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
and this galaxy is spiral.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
After the machine learns the concept,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
it will ask the machine,

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
is this new galaxy elliptical or spiral?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
In this part of the study,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
we get some interesting results.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
In the first part,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
we found that some galaxies,

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
CNN is very sure that it is a spiral galaxy.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
However,

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
when we look at Galaxy Zoo's classification,

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
we found that they think it is elliptical.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Later, we found that

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
because the depth data has a better resolution

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
and a deeper depth,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
it can observe a deeper scene.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Therefore,

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
the data used in Galaxy Zoo is better.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
You can see that

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
in the two images I show,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
they are all the same depth.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
However,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
the depth data on the left

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
clearly shows a spiral arm structure.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
However,

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
the SDSS data on the right is not visible.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
Galaxy Zoo is based on SDSS data to do visual classification.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Therefore,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
we found that

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
using our machine learning and depth data,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
the most reliable visual classification catalog

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
needs to be updated.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
We found that

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
about 2.5% of the galaxies are mislabeled

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
and need to be updated.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
After the correction,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
we found that

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
using binary classification,

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
we can achieve about 99% accuracy.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's quite impressive.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
In some cases,

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
it is almost more accurate than the human eye,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
especially in darker conditions

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
or higher redshift conditions.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
This is the heavy ending.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
It sounds like

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Galaxy classification using supervised machine learning

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
seems to be very reliable.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You can achieve 99% accuracy.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
There's nothing to worry about.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But not quite yet.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
You can probably imagine

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
that Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
binary classification system.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used binary classification system.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
It's based on the human eye.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I don't know how much confidence you have in humans,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
but I don't have much confidence.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I think the human eye is very biased.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
A lot of research shows that

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
even if two very professional astronomers

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
are doing the classification,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
their results may not necessarily match.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
Especially if the image resolution or image quality has changed,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
the two people may have different opinions.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
So let's take a look at Hubble Sequence again.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
When we did supervised,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
it was actually very simple.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
We did the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But in fact, it's very detailed.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
And you don't know why it can be so detailed.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
I've been doing galaxy morphology for a long time,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
but I still don't really understand

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
why they can be so detailed.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
For example, like the spiral galaxies,

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
it can be divided into at least three different evolution stages.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
A, B, and C.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
They are different evolution states.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
The elliptical star system is a little bit more understandable.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's based on different ellipticity

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
and there are seven different stages.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Then there's another one that's more incomprehensible,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
which is the lenticular galaxies.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
between the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
And it doesn't have spiral arms.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
It's basically obvious that it doesn't have spiral arms.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
But sometimes it might be because of the resolution.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
But it's more like a spiral galaxy in terms of structure.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
So we think that

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
the current theory is that it's in the middle.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Maybe it's a transition period.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
We also have another one called spiral bar galaxies.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It's in the middle.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
There's a bar in the center of the star system.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
This is called a bar galaxy.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And of course, there's the rest.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
We really can't classify it.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It's called irregular galaxies.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It looks weird.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Then let's talk about the classification.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I don't know if you can...

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
I don't think you can leave a comment,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
so you can turn on the microphone and say it.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Let's test it.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Can you tell which one is a spiral galaxy?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Actually, you can turn on the microphone and say it.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
But you can also leave a comment.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
If you want to vote to count it,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
you can type it right next to it.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I don't think you can see the comments.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I can...

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Because you're sharing the screen now.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
But I can help you see it.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Someone said 3.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
I'll type 4.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Someone said 4.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Now 1 also has one vote.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
3. 3 also has one vote.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
So 3 has two votes now.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
4 has two votes now.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
1 has one vote now.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
2 is very popular.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
There's no 2.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
There's 1 and 3.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, that's about it.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Okay.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
The answer to this question is 3.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
3 is an early spiral galaxy.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
It's a relatively early one.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
You just saw the SA part.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
This question is relatively simple.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Let's move on to the next question.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Which one is an elliptical galaxy?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Okay.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
YT, do you want to answer the previous question or this one?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I think it's an elliptical galaxy.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Oh, okay.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
So from Ethan...

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Sorry, it's not Ethan.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
What is it?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Alpha.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Okay, start.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
It's 4.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Then I'm going to answer...

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
I don't know. 2?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
I don't know.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Okay.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
4 and 2.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
It's probably 2.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
2 has one vote.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Okay.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I have the same answer as YT.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I'm very confident now.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And Wicca also answered 2.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
YT is an expert.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Okay.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Okay.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Then we're going to announce the answer.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
None of them is an elliptical galaxy.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Oh.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yes.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Everyone can...

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
In fact, everyone can give a concept.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Here, 1 and 2 and 4.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
You think it feels like an elliptical galaxy.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
They are actually all elliptical galaxies.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So you can probably feel that

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
human judgment is actually a very, very inaccurate way.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Give everyone a feeling.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Okay.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
So this is my other research.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
I'm also doing this part more often.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I'm more interested in this part.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Excuse me, can I ask a question?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yes.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
In those questions just now,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
maybe I missed something just now.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
How do you know what the correct answer is?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
My correct answer is...

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
This is a good question.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
This is a good question.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
So our correct answer is actually based on another astronomer.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Just the other two astronomers.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
At present, it is what we think is the most accurate judgment.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Go up and give the correct answer.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
But in fact, they may be wrong.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
So...

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yes.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
According to you, there may be...

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
This is actually...

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Maybe 2 is really an elliptical galaxy.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
We are not sure.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But according to his answer,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
We think he is the correct answer.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
OK, I see.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Thank you.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yes.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
1 and 2 are both a little bit tricky.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I would say it's a little bit tricky.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
2, I might be more inclined to say it's an elliptical galaxy.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
But...

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
It's just that it's really tricky to judge.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Then I actually mainly want to express a concept that is...

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
The decision boundary of this judgment is actually not that accurate.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And this is why I want to go...

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Uh...

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Uh...

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Start my second part of the research.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
What about this part of the research?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
I...

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
In fact, I just want to answer this question.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That is, if...

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
If a machine can comprehensively see all galaxies,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
How would he categorize them?

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
The basic idea is that I hope to use machine classification to replace the classification of human eyes.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Because now our galaxy morphology is basically based on this Hubble sequence.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
This Hubble sequence has been used for more than 100 years.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's not more than 100 years.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
It's almost 100 years.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
So...

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
It is a good time for them to change.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
To revolutionize an idea.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
So...

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
There are two parts of this problem that you have to deal with.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
One is how to make the machine comprehensively see.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
The second part is how to do the categorization.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
What about the first part?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
I...

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Uh...

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
I thought of...

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Uh...

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Of course there are many different approaches.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Because in fact, apart from me,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
There is another team doing it.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
So...

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Before I wrote this paper,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
In fact, there are two other papers.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Of course, the methods we use are different.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
What I choose to use here is Autoencoder.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I'm not sure if you're familiar with Autoencoder.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
Autoencoder itself is a self-supervised machine learning algorithm.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
So...

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Self-supervised means that its input and output are actually the same data.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
When you're in the training machine,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Your input and output are exactly the same thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
The idea is to say...

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Uh...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
When you, for example, like this image today.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
You input an image.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
That goes through the convolutional layers.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
You try to extract some features.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
And then you can represent this input image.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
And then you use these extracted latent features.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
And then you want to rebuild your image.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Become your output.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Ideally, your output and your input should be better and better.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
If it's well rebuilt,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
That means your latent features have caught the point.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
That's one of the reasons I use Autoencoder.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
And then use it to do feature extraction.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Find some better features.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Next, unsupervised machine learning.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It's a representation of this picture.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
It's simple.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
We don't tell the machine what these images are.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
We don't tell it what a dog is.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
We don't tell it what a fried chicken is.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
We just give it this picture.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And then you say, hey, you sort it out.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Sort it out.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
So, uh, it's very obvious that you can see a little bit.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Uh, because we didn't give him any prior knowledge.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
So, in fact, unsupervised machine learning often encounters a situation.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Uh, machine sorting.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
We human scientists want to do is completely different.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It's just that it doesn't match at all.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
So, how do you make it comprehensive?

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
The idea of ​​comprehension is that the concept of human beings can be more integrated.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
It's more related to the science we want to do.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
It's going to be a big problem.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Can I ask a more naive question?

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
That is to say, when you are in these pictures,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
You are.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Will he do it, for example, like CNB?

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Make it a fully transformed map to a post.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
On the bed.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And then do it again.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Or just do it directly.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Directly to him.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Uh, for example, the mass distribution of Gauss.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And then do the analysis directly.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Do it directly and apply it to the machine learning model.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Inside.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Uh, we're just using images directly.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
We don't even do the mass distribution part.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
If it's an image.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Because we're doing Gauss morphology.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
So, in fact, our focus is only on that.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
It's like doing an analysis when you look at it with the naked eye.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
We just look at the image itself.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
So, I hope that the machine will capture the image.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
That's it.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Oh, then I want to ask another question.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Because he might be because of your image.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
For example, you might have some white noise or red noise or something.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
So why not?

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
For example, like CNB, they also have very strong white noise.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So why don't you know?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Maybe someone did that.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
The question is, would you do one?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
For example, do a mapping.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Map it to another one.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
A different one.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Uh, for example.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Maybe it would be better to do an analysis.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Because.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Because it's like a picture of a dog or a picture of a fried chicken.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Their white noise is also very strong.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
For example, the fried chicken powder on the fried chicken.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
It's a white noise.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It will affect your analysis.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
So if you just do an analysis of this image, it will be more difficult.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And then it's not just doing this.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
For example, it would be better.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Would anyone do that?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Uh, I haven't heard of it.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
But, uh, you mentioned a pretty important point.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
We actually have preprocessing.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Just get rid of the noise first.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Uh-huh.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah, so getting rid of the noise is actually a pretty important step.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
So all of our images have been preprocessed first.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And of course, sometimes.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Uh, for example, I just mentioned the supervised part.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
I even use gradient image.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's not just a pure linear image.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
There's a lot of preprocessing processes that need to be done first.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Got it.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Thank you.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Yeah.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay, so, uh.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Uh, this left picture is my main pipeline.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Uh, using the pipeline.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
What about the feature learning process?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I'm actually using a special autoencoder.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
And then it's called VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
And it's Google Demind.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
It's an algorithm that was made a few years ago.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
So the idea is, why use this?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
In fact, it has a big advantage.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Uh, vector quantization.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
It can speed up the entire feature learning process.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Because if there's no vector quantization.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Uh, this process.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Uh, my previous research was that I used a general autoencoder.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Convolutional autoencoder.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
So it's in, uh, feature learning.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
It's about 100,000 images.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And in the case of using GPU.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
It takes about four to five days.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
But, uh.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
The use is VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It basically only takes a few hours.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So you can find this.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
It's a very big leap.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
So, uh, that's why I'm using this part of the reason.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
So, uh, the process of speeding up this feature learning.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
For the future, if I want to go further.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Uh, extend this research to make it.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Adapt to survey data.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It would also be more helpful.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Because the survey data itself is already very, very huge.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
So if it's 100,000, it's going to take four to five days.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Then I might not be able to finish it.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And then, uh, after feature learning.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
So now it's every image.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
You can, uh.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Every image is represented by a set of.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Extracted features.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
That's what you just said.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Lantern features.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
So we're going to use this lantern feature.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
To do unsupervised machine learning.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
So we're going to, uh, we're going to use hierarchical clustering for this part.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
So the concept of hierarchical clustering is actually quite simple.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It's every image.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Uh, at the beginning, every image is a group.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
So we're just going to merge it little by little.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Uh, according to the similarity of your, uh, lantern feature.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
The similarity of the row combination.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
To gradually merge them.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
So the advantage of using this algorithm is, uh.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
A lot of, uh, machine learning clustering algorithm.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
He actually needs you to guess.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Is to give a data distribution first.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
For example, Gaussian distribution.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, you might need to guess in advance.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
Or know in advance what some of this data is like.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
How is it distributed in the feature space?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
But hierarchical clustering doesn't have to do that.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
So relatively speaking, there is no bias.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
And then in this study, we are.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Oh, my God, I'm running out of time.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
In this study, there are three very important strategies that we have proposed.

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
So this part is to make our eyes, uh, to make my, uh, classification skin.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
It's more.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Uh, it's more sensible.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
So the first part is, uh.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
When we're doing feature learning.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
After that, we thought about a quick clustering result.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
What about this quick clustering?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
We're going to divide it into two groups.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
What about the idea?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Why do you do that?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
The idea is to say, uh, we want us to extract it.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Features.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
He can not only rebuild your input image.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
At the same time, you want to capture some features.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
It can be well divided into two groups on the feature space.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Groups like this, two groups.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
So, uh.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
What about this approach?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
It's quite effective, which is to stabilize our whole algorithm.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
To divide the initial two groups.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
The idea is like this.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
This is a simple result.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Uh, after this.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Uh.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
After this design.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Uh, we're always in.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
If we force our class to be divided into two groups.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
What about the time?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
We always get one.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
It's the last feature group and the feature group.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Uh, this part is relatively easy to understand.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Because you know, they're on the back of the virus.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
It's just.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
How, how different you are.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
So there should be less feature group and feature group.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
But, uh.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
After we've designed this, we've added an extra classroom.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
What about the process of feature learning?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Our last feature group and feature group.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
They, uh.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Visual class.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Uh.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Visual morphology.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Percentage is different.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Uh.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
That's not easy to say.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Um.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
It's just a different type of human eye.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
The ratio in these less feature groups or feature groups.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Is stable.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
And that's a pretty important thing.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Because if you don't add this classroom process.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Then he.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He might still be like this.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
But there's a difference in proportion.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Then you'll find that, oh, this whole machine, it's actually.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
You know, it's kind of like that.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
But he's actually not very stable.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
So, uh.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Involve this strategy becomes very important.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
What about the second point?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Uh.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
You can find the code on the line.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
It's basically allowed a single cut.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Single cut means that I'm on this picture.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
It's a bad one.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Horizontal straight line.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Uh.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
This straight line is the class.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
It's just.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
It's just telling you, oh, this is my top.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
So, uh.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
You figure out how many clusters are how many clusters.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
But there's a big problem with that.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Especially on the gas.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It's a big problem.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Uh.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
That is to say, um.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
If you're in.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
For example.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Galaxies.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
You can imagine that.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
It's just that they're actually extracted.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
It's not going to be much different.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
It's easy to imagine because it's actually the same thing.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It looks like it's on the ground.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
In fact, it doesn't look much different.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Of course, it's not going to go anywhere.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
But it's not the same.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
It's just that his appearance can change a lot.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
For example, your spiral is in a different position.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Ah, or your spiral is closer to you.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Or is it far from you?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
The whole thing is going to be a lot worse.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
But they're all called Spiral Galaxy.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
So, if you're only allowed to be single, you're going to have a situation.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
It's you.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
Your less feature group has too many unnecessary.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Uh, clusters.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
But your.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Feature group may not be enough.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
It's your.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Uh.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Group may not be enough.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
So.

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
So, uh, at this point, we're going to, uh, in this study, we're going to allow it to have different.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
Uh, on each line, in different branches, in this merger tree, we allow different distances.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
So.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
The next obvious question is where to cut.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
So, where are we going to make that line?

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
So, here, I'm going to jump out and talk about a very important question.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
It's when you're doing unsupervised machine learning.

40:20.000 --> 40:29.000
And when you're doing gap, uh, when you're doing this research, a very basic question, a fundamental question is how many classes.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
We should have.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
And this is actually a question of how many classes you're going to have.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
And this question is actually a tricky question in every unsupervised machine learning.

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
Uh, ideally, of course, you can have as many as you want.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
But there's always going to be a point where you're going to find that, uh, it doesn't make any sense at all.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
If you divide too much.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
And I just mentioned that, uh, before I did, there were actually two other.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Paper is related to this.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
So, they're in the galaxy morphology classification that they came up with.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
It's about, uh, let's talk about it.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Harbour is probably divided.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
You're strictly, uh.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Strictly speaking, you can say that it's divided into eight categories.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
What about the paper before that?

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
They divided it into about 160 classifications.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
So, you know, it's, uh, 160.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
It's not that you can't, but you're analyzing it.

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
On the scientific research, you'll find that, uh, it doesn't seem to be able to find some.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Uh, similarity or do some, uh, conclude something.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
So, how many classes have become very important?

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Uh, what kind of numbers are correct?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
What about here?

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It's us.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
Uh, we chose to use a very different way from the previous research.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
So, our way is that we want to use, uh, the variation of gas orientation.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
So, what does that mean?

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
Basically, you're going to find that some galaxies, especially spiral galaxies.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
They actually look pretty much the same.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
But they just seem to be turning an angle.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
So, this kind of galaxy is what you're going to do if you're using auto-encoder.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
They're just turning an angle.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
But because, uh, auto-encoder is going to keep them, uh, it's going to be completely different.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
So, auto-encoder.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
Uh, after auto-encoder, when you're using classroom, they're going to be divided into different groups.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So, that's not the result we want.

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
Because if they look pretty much the same, of course, we want them to be in the same group.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
So, the idea is that, uh, there's always going to be a point on your merger tree.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
Because they're all based on, uh, similarity.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
So, at some point, you'll find that there's a cluster.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
The reason it's because of this gas orientation.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
So, if we can find out where this happened.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
To calculate what is distance of this gas orientation.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
So, we can use this to do a distance cut.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
So, this way, we can solve our first problem.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Where to cut?

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
So, this gas orientation can provide the place where to cut in each different branch.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
And then, it can also solve a very important problem.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
How many branches do we want?

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
So, it can provide a number of classification that doesn't behave gas orientation.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
So, the final result is to give us 27 clusters.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
So, this number is definitely much more reasonable than 160.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
It's a little biased, in my opinion.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
But I think most astronomers will agree with me.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
So, 27 should be more reasonable than 160 in gas morphology.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
So, I'm not going to talk too much about the details.

44:09.000 --> 44:17.000
But we have found that they are basically based on the gas structure and gas shape.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And then there's this kind of classification.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
So, this picture is a little bit more difficult to explain.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
But the general concept is that we each.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
So, a bar here is a group.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
So, you can see that there are two groups here.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
And then there are three groups here.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
This is a machine-classified group.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
So, the general concept here is to say.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
A galaxy with a similar structure.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
So, they are structurally very similar structures.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Because they are divided into the same group.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It means that they are structurally very similar.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
They can be visually classified as multiple different morphology.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
For example, here is the galaxy in this group.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
It can be judged by your eyes.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
They will be classified into either elliptical galaxies or lenticular galaxies.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
So, what about the different blue parts here?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
There are different fractions of bar galaxies.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
The darker it is, it means that there are more bar galaxies in it.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
So, we're going to show you an example today.

45:27.000 --> 45:36.000
So, for example, in this group, there are no significant bar galaxies, bar features.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
And then this is a relatively weak bar feature.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
And then there's a group that has a relatively strong bar feature.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
And then there's another point.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
You'll find that it's pretty important.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
You'll find that it's visual classification.

45:56.000 --> 46:06.000
Like I just mentioned, galaxies with similar structures can be visually classified as multiple different galaxy morphology.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Especially, for example, lenticular galaxies.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
We just mentioned that lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
It's between elliptical galaxies and elliptical galaxies.

46:16.000 --> 46:25.000
So, we're going to do some analysis of lenticular galaxies in a group.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
We're going to use the search index.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
Basically, the smaller the number, the more likely it is to be this galaxy.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
And then we mean it's more likely to be a spiral galaxy.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
The larger the number, the more likely it is to be a bulge galaxy.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
And then there's the elliptical galaxy.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
We found that the blue one is group 27.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
It's a mix of lenticular galaxies and early spirals.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
The red one is a mix of elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
Only the yellow one is really full of lenticular galaxies.

47:04.000 --> 47:18.000
So, you can see that in terms of structure, only very moderate structures can be called lenticular galaxies.

47:18.000 --> 47:28.000
Most of the time, the judgment of the naked eye is that lenticular galaxies are actually all mixed up with early spirals and elliptical galaxies.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
It's not that easy to tell the structure apart.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
So, in the end, we're going to take the 27 clusters that we've divided up and we're going to do some physical comparison.

47:39.000 --> 47:46.000
So, you can see that we have color, absolute magnitude, standard mass, and size, physical size.

47:46.000 --> 47:52.000
So, you can see that there's a slight difference between each of our clusters.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
It's a slight difference, but it's obvious.

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
It's an obvious change.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
It's a gradual change.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
So, here are two plots.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
Basically, these two plots are the plots that we use a lot in our information analysis.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
It's a color magnitude diagram and a mass size diagram.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
The star part is visual classification.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
We're going to do a comparison over there.

48:24.000 --> 48:34.000
You can see that our 27 clusters are actually well distributed between different visual morphology.

48:34.000 --> 48:46.000
It means that if you use this machine classification method, you might be able to find some missing morphology.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
It actually needs to be identified.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
But in visual classification, it's not that obvious.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
It's just that the eyes can't be so sensitive to find out that there's actually a difference like this.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
So, basically, this is the end of my talk.

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
We still have some continued follow-up plans for this part of the research.

49:09.000 --> 49:24.000
My main goal is to use machine learning to build an unbiased and reproducible machine classification scheme.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
It can be used by different people and different surfaces.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
It can even be applied to different redshifts.

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
This is a pretty ambitious project.

49:37.000 --> 49:46.000
But I think this is a way to revolutionize what we know in current gas morphology.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Because we're now relying too much on visual classification.

49:50.000 --> 49:57.000
I think the main thing I want to share with you today is that machine learning is a growing area.

49:57.000 --> 50:05.000
And in the astronomy world, we're mostly still focused on accuracy and efficiency.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
But in fact, machine learning has more potential to be explored.

50:10.000 --> 50:20.000
For example, here, we use machine learning to think of ways to change our concepts of astronomy.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
I hope it can change some of the concepts we have about astronomy.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
That's about it. Thank you.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Please turn on the microphone.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
Let's give a warm round of applause to Tim for his wonderful presentation.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Let's start the Q&A.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
But before we start, I'd like to ask a few questions for those of you who are in the chat.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
The first question is, which of the algorithms is better?

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
I think this question is a little too general.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
So if you want to clarify, you can just open the microphone and say it.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
If not, we'll just ask Tim to answer.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
Like I said, this is a little too general.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
I think it depends on your science topic.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
But in terms of the last part of my presentation,

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
in terms of my classification scheme,

51:38.000 --> 51:48.000
I think the algorithms I'm using are the best combination of all the algorithms I've used so far.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
Because I think auto-encoder is probably the best explanation for this question.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
Some people used self-organized maps in their previous research.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
It's also a way to unsupervised machine learning.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
But I don't think it's as effective as auto-encoder.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
A lot of people want to de-rotate the galaxy orientation first.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
De-rotate the galaxy so that it's all facing the same direction.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
That's another algorithm.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
It's also a form of auto-encoder, but it's a concept of de-rotation.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
So there are actually a lot of different algorithms that can be used.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
But I think the simplest is the best.

52:32.000 --> 52:40.000
At the moment, I think this pipeline is the best combination I can think of.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Otherwise, I wouldn't use it.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
I hope that answers your question.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
We can chat later if there are any further comments.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
We have another question.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
The next question is from Altha and Herman.

53:00.000 --> 53:07.000
They want to know if you can briefly introduce your other project, Lyman-Alpha-Forest-IgM.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Sure.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
I still use supervised machine learning.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I use a convolutional network.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I have some Quasar spectra.

53:18.000 --> 53:24.000
I try to identify Lyman-Alpha-Forest using a convolutional network.

53:24.000 --> 53:33.000
I also predict some physical properties like current density, Doppler width, and the rate shift of these systems.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
I'm currently writing a paper.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
This machine has already been developed.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
We use this machine.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
It's a chain with mock spectra.

53:45.000 --> 53:51.000
But it can also predict values for observation spectra.

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
So we're going to provide this machine with the highest data.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
It's a very high resolution from Keck Observatory.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
So we're going to use this part and build a catalog.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
So this is another catalog paper we're writing right now.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Based on this catalog...

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Because we have a lot of...

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
In Lyman-Alpha-Forest, there was a 2012 catalog.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
So you know, it's a long time ago.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
The author spent three years to analyze 15 spectra.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
Now our CNN can reach the same accuracy as him.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
But we only need five minutes to analyze a Quasar spectra.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
So now we have a lot of data.

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
Because the highest data actually has hundreds of spectra.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
But he could only analyze 15 at the time.

54:47.000 --> 54:55.000
So based on this catalog, we're going to do some IGN or IGN transitional to CGM research.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
Okay, I hope that's the answer.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
If you want to ask further, you can continue to ask.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Then I personally have a question.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
My question is this.

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
In addition to using your algorithm to directly put it on the real data.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Have you ever tried to put this on?

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
You know his underlying physics assumption simulation.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And then see what happens.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
For example, the mass of dark matter is very heavy galaxy.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Will it all fall into one of your classification?

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Or will dark metal fall into one of them?

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
That is, so you can understand that these classes.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Uh, what is the underlying physics?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Have you ever thought about doing that?

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
Uh, uh, actually, this is one of the projects I'm doing right now.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
The direction is a little different.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Because that's what you're talking about.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
It's the next step I want to do.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
What we're doing right now is we're using simulations.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
And then we apply this classification scheme.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
And then we look at the different classifications.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Uh, different classifications.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
Then he, we respect his history.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
To see, to see if he has a single history.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Basically, we want to know that our classification scheme is not.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Visual classification is more physically meaningful.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
That's what I'm doing right now with the simulation.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Because this part is more important.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
We have to make sure that our classification can be.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Uh.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
The next step is what you just mentioned.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
We would like to be able to, if this part of us is confirmed.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
After this part is strengthened, the next step we will want to know.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
What kind of physics will influence us to form this kind of gas morphology?

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
Whether it's from the simulation or from the observation.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
This part is going to be very interesting.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
Because if we look at it from the simulation, we can see it directly.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Uh, you can see that, uh, you can understand it directly.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Study that today's gas morphology is.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
According to what kind of physics process to form.

57:09.000 --> 57:16.000
So, from the observation, you can build something like a family tree.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Of a galaxy.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
This idea, or you can add you.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
We have a lot of different terms, which is used to define gas.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
For example, like slow rotator, or.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Uh.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
Red, red, red nuggets, blue nuggets, etc.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
They may actually just be because of their.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Formation history is different.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Then we hope that the machine gives a more detailed.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
Classification can help to explain such a question.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
Thank you.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Okay, so do you have any questions?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Uh, okay.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Can I ask a question?

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
Um, so I actually have two questions.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
And then the first question is.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
You just said that orientation.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
That is, there is.

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
What algorithm you can look at a galaxy map and then you can know what its orientation should be.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
So you can.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
Just put it back in the direction you want.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And then the other question is.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
Uh, you, you use the data, we use it, is the data of the multi-colour.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Go down and turn together.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
Because it's just the same as the galaxy.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It should be a very strong correlation.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
It feels like there's more information to use.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
Uh, the first part of the question.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
It's actually just the rotation.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
It's a very, very difficult problem.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Simply put, you can think about it.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
That's where your reference point is.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
So how do you know that you're going to measure first?

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
Uh, where to see the orientation direction is a question mark.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And then there's your reference point.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Where is it?

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
So, of course, there are people in this part.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
You can do it because you can actually define where it is.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
You can actually define where it is.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Where is it?

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Then you might use it.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
It's to define where the direction of the rotation is.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
You can probably do that, but.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Overall, it's just that he's still a little tricky.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
So this part has always been in our.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Because there were two different studies before.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
So this part is.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
A lot of people want to deal with this.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
But we're doing this research today.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
We're doing this part of the research.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Think about it in a different direction.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
He might not be a problem.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
He might be able to help us make more effective decisions.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
In the end, how many classes do we need to produce?

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
So far, he's not an ideal.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Ideal solution.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
But, um.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It's him.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Anyway, the concept of this paper is.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
A different way to solve the problem.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You don't have to think of it as a.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You have to solve it.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
You have to have a low rotation.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You can think of it as a.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Just let you decide.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Oh, how many classes are we?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
We are the most reasonable.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Is that a solution to your question?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Yeah, I get it.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Thank you.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
The second part.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
The second part of the question is.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The second part is.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Do you use it?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Oh.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yeah, that's part of it.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What I'm doing right now.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Because when I was doing this project.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I'm a Ph.D. student.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I basically don't have that much.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Uh, memory or space.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You can put so much data.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So I only used it at that time.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Okay, go ahead.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Yeah.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This is a problem that is not enough.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But it is in this part.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Uh.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Multi-color is a very important point.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But multi-color processing.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
He has another question.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We have encountered it so far.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Just be very careful.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
One thing is.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Indeed.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Galaxy morphology is related to color.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But he is not.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Uh.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Not completely.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
You know.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
How to say.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
To say that.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We know.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Most of.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
They are passive.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
They are red.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
There will be an exception.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The so-called exception is.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We have red.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Uh.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
If you go.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That's what we're thinking about today.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
To say.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Do you want to use multi-color or single color?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Because single color can actually.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Purely let you focus on the galaxy morphology.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Then you.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You can know.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
If today.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Maybe there are some things.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
He has some galaxy.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
He's actually a tree.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But he is.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
This kind of.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
You.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Just look at his galaxy morphology.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You have to be accurate.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But if you involve those colors today.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Information.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Then.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You might be.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
You might be.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Plus.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's in there.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's just that you might make us feel like.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Oh.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
He has to be divided like this.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So this part.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's actually a bit tricky to deal with.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So we're still dealing with it.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
What the hell.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The second part of the data.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Yeah.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000

Let's give it up again.
