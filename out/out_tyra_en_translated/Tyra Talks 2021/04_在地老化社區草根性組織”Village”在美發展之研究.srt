1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today's speaker is Qiu Yiting. Yiting graduated from Chenggong University with a master's degree in urban planning, and at the same time retired from political studies.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
His master's degree is in the National Institute of Development, Taiwan University, and he is now a PhD candidate for George Mason's Public Policy.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yiting's research is cross-field policy research, and his main interest is local and national development.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
His important experiences in recent years include the assistant of the Chinese and French branch of the Taiwan Economic Research Institute's Sino-US Trade War, and the course teacher of the NCAR Learning, a non-profit organization for the benefit of the French.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the introduction of today's speaker. Let's not talk too much and let Yiting start today's speech. Thank you.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you very much for the introduction. I hope everyone can hear me. Thank you everyone for taking the time to listen to my speech.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry. Everyone can see the screen, right? This is the topic of my PhD paper.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can you see the screen? I'm sorry. I forgot to share it. I'm sorry.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can you see the screen now?

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It seems to be coming out.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I see only gray.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do I have to share it again?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, let's share it again.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you everyone for taking the time to listen to my speech.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry. I forgot to share it again.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry. I forgot to share it again.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you see the screen now?

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It seems to be coming out.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I see only gray.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It seems to be coming out.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Did you share it again?

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, I shared it again.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do I have to share it again?

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, share it again.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It seems to be coming out.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can you see the screen now?

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It seems to be coming out.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can you see the screen now?

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can you see the screen now?

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, I can see the screen now.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Can you see the screen now?

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Can you see the screen now?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why do I see a black screen now?

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm black now. What should I adjust?

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm black now. What should I adjust?

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Look at your software.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Look at your software.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Look at your software.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Look at your software.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sorry, I accidentally press your stop button.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sorry, I accidentally press your stop button.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sorry, I accidentally pressed your stop button.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can you use it again?

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please wait for me to use it again.

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you see it?

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now it becomes your checklist of the Lord of the Rings.

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, I'll change it later.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now it works.

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Can everyone see it?

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you. I'm very sorry.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you very much for listening to today's lecture.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is the topic of my doctoral thesis.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm discussing a type of community grass roots

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that is growing rapidly in Taiwan.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think this organization is initiated by the residents

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and provides non-medical but vital care and services

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to the local elderly residents.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think many countries, including Taiwan,

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
are facing an aging problem.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I think it's meaningful to discuss this phenomenon

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and the causes behind it.

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This organization is called Villages.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not an ordinary village.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The village is its name.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So my research goal is to discuss

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the social and economic factors

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
behind this organization.

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In the past 20 years,

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
there have been more and more organizations like this

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in the United States.

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So here's a definition.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a community organization.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Its goal is to help the local residents

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to grow old together.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Villages provide non-medical services

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to the local residents,

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
especially the elderly residents.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
For example, they drive you to the doctor's office

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
or provide you with some growth courses

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
or social activities.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
For example, they change light bulbs

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or teach the elderly how to use computers.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All kinds of non-medical services.

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This organization, called Villages,

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is founded by the elderly in the community

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and by the local residents.

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This organization is run by the local volunteers

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and the non-governmental organizations.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They also contribute to the organization.

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sometimes they apply for funds

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
from the government or non-governmental organizations.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Some of the donations are from private donors.

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The first organization, called Villages,

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
was founded in Beacon Hill, Boston.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It was founded in 2002.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A lot of people heard about this organization

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and thought it was a good idea.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So they decided to follow the Boston model

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and set up an organization in their community.

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is just an example.

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
One of the Villages is in California.

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Their website provides services

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
such as health information,

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
free education,

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
social activities,

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and sports.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The number of Villages is increasing.

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
with low-income communities.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Not only in the U.S.,

113
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
but also in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Villages have influenced

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
their local communities.

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not like McDonald's

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
where there are branches in the headquarters.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Each Village is an independent organization.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They are registered as a non-profit organization.

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
with low-income communities.

122
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They follow the Boston model.

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There are many different types of Villages.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Some Villages may belong to other organizations,

125
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
such as senior centers,

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
churches, and so on.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There are many different types of Villages.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They are different from one another.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The most typical example is a Village

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that is registered as a non-profit organization.

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There is another non-profit organization

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
called Hop & Spook Model.

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's located in Portland, Metropolitan.

134
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's like a headquarters with branches.

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The headquarters is called NW Village.

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a non-profit organization.

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a non-profit organization.

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a non-profit organization.

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a non-profit organization.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The average cost per m僚 is higher.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The cost will be covered

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
by the headquarters.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The independent Villages will only take care of

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
service members and training staff.

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The average cost per m僚

146
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
will be lower.

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The cost per m僚

148
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
will be covered by the headquarters.

149
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The independent Villages will only take care

150
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of service members and training staff.

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The average cost per m僚

152
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
will be covered by the headquarters.

153
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The independent Villages will only take care of

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
service members and training staff.

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It is subordinate to other organizations.

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Some você

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
code of conduct

158
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is the filiation

159
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
or program

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
whereas there may be a unit

161
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that is installed independently.

162
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The value of this model is

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that it is driven by users

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
compared to other organizations

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that provide care for the elderly.

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It reflects the needs of the elderly

167
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
rather than those provided by the government

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
or other private organizations.

169
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It is a service provided by the user

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to provide community resources.

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
On the other hand,

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the village model

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is less dependent on the government.

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
As I mentioned,

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
the village model

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is more flexible

177
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
compared to other organizations.

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
For example,

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
there is a village

180
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
with several group homes.

181
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Some elderly need professional care

182
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and some elderly need professional care.

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It is similar to

184
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
single-family homes.

185
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Each room is for one elderly.

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
One or two nurses

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
supervise the elderly

188
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
or take care of their daily needs.

189
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The village model

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
has several group homes.

191
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The elderly,

192
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
for example,

193
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
provide care for the elderly.

194
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The village model

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It reflects the needs of the elderly

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and provides community resources.

198
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The village model

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

200
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The village model

201
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

202
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The village model

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The village model

205
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The village model

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is more flexible

208
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
compared to other organizations.

209
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
In my opinion,

210
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the village model

211
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

212
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

213
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

214
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

215
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Another special thing about the village model

216
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is the coalition.

217
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
For example,

218
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in a region,

219
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
like DC,

220
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
there will be a coalition.

221
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The purpose of the coalition is to provide a platform

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to share resources.

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
For example,

224
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
if a community wants to build a village,

225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
they will go to the coalition to learn

226
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and learn from the experience.

227
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For example,

228
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
California has a village network.

229
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Washington has a village network.

230
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Bay Area has a village network.

231
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The main function of the coalition

232
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is to share resources.

233
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
For example,

234
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Washington DC has a village network.

235
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Washington DC has a village network.

236
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Washington DC has a village network.

237
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
My research question is

238
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
why this type of organization

239
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
appeared in the US in the past 20 years?

240
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Why didn't it appear earlier?

241
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why didn't it appear earlier?

242
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Second,

243
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?

244
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For example,

245
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
what is the background of the local community?

246
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Third,

247
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What is the background of the local community?

249
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What is the background of the local community?

250
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
These are my assumptions.

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
These are my assumptions.

252
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
First,

253
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the aging of society

254
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
has led to the emergence of the village model.

255
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
has led to the emergence of the village model.

256
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Second,

257
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
the emergence of the village model

258
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
is an important factor.

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's like a new venture.

260
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's like a new venture.

261
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's like a new venture.

262
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Creators' individual improvements

263
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
are very important in this process.

264
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Creators' individual improvements are very important in this process.

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Finally,

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,080
the dispersion of social networks

267
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,080
is very important

268
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,080
in this process.

269
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
In this process,

270
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
it is very important

271
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
that the community

272
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
has a strong social network.

273
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
It is very important

274
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
that the community has a strong social network.

275
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,080
It is very important

276
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,080
that the community has a strong social network.

277
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,080
It is very important

278
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,080
that the community has a strong social network.

279
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,080
It is very important

280
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,080
that the community has a strong social network.

281
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,080
It is very important

282
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
that the community has a strong social network.

283
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,080
It is critical

284
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,720
that the community has a strong social network.

285
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,720
It is critical

286
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
that the community has a strong social network.

287
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,720
It is critical

288
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,660
that the community has a strong social network.

289
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

290
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,020
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

291
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,360
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

292
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,860
Since then,

293
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,860
it is reported that the relevance of our series

294
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,360
of presentations

295
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
has become an important factor.

296
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
The average income of a community

297
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
The average income of a community

298
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,360
is a positive factor or a negative factor.

299
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,360
is a positive factor or a negative factor.

300
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,360
My assumption is that

301
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,360
it is a linear relationship.

302
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,360
If it is a very low-income community,

303
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,360
the organization needs to invest a lot of effort

304
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
the organization needs to invest a lot of effort

305
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,360
If it is a very low-income community,

306
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,360
it is difficult to maintain the livelihood.

307
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,360
It is difficult to maintain the livelihood.

308
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,360
For a very high-income community,

309
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,360
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.

310
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,360
so there is no right-wing organization to build a community.

311
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,360
For a very high-income community,

312
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,360
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.

313
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,360
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.

314
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,360
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.

315
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
However, there are some differences in my interviews.

316
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,360
For example,

317
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,360
when a community has a village,

318
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,360
when a community has a village,

319
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,360
there will be new social connections.

320
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,360
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.

321
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,360
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.

322
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
This is a community phenomenon,

323
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,180
so they can't really observe it.

324
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,180
so they can't really observe it.

325
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,320
So, my method includes

326
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,740
studying and

327
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,740
looking around detailed.

328
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,740
For large city RoV criteria,

329
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,740
I generally look into individual people with disabilities,

330
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,740
and use ground theory to do some research.

331
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,740
and use ground theory to do some research.

332
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,740
I'll talk about this in detail later.

333
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,740
So, how do I find these villages?

334
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,740
My research is limited to the United States,

335
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,740
so it's relatively simple.

336
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,740
So, how do I find the villages in the United States?

337
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,740
A list of the cities under the Yoga Village Coalition

338
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,740
includes members and non-members

339
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,740
and listed on the listing.

340
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,740
There are two biggest Coalition in the region.

341
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,740
The UC and D.C.

342
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,740
have their lists referred to.

343
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,740
First,

344
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,740
they conduct a survey

345
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,740
to understand their basic situation,

346
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,740
such as their establishment time,

347
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,740
service scope, and so on.

348
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,740
Their address is their office address,

349
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,740
but not their service scope.

350
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,740
You don't know how big their service scope is.

351
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Because of the pandemic,

352
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,740
they spend a lot of time on this.

353
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,740
I listed the total number of villages

354
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,740
and how many are still

355
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,740
under preparation.

356
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,740
There are four villages

357
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,740
that are still under preparation

358
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,740
due to the pandemic.

359
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Unfortunately, the village is closed due to the pandemic.

360
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,740
As far as I know,

361
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,740
at least one village has reopened.

362
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,740
I collected 120 samples in this survey.

363
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,740
On the Global Coalition website,

364
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,740
they also listed

365
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,740
their areas of interest.

366
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,740
They identified their areas

367
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,740
as metropolitan, suburban,

368
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,740
or rural areas.

369
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,740
I used this to compare

370
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:16,740
and show the representation of my sample.

371
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,740
This is the information I collected

372
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,740
in this survey.

373
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,740
You can see that the two villages

374
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,740
are very similar.

375
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,740
As for the establishment time,

376
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,740
the total number of villages

377
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,740
is less than the total number of villages

378
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,740
on the previous table.

379
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,740
You can see that

380
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,740
the first village was established in 2002.

381
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,740
Why is there an earlier year?

382
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Because that village belongs to a certain organization.

383
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,740
The time given is the establishment time

384
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,740
of that unit.

385
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,740
In 1952,

386
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,740
you can see that

387
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,740
the number of villages

388
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,740
is relatively lower than

389
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,740
the number of villages

390
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,740
on the previous table.

391
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,740
There is a big difference

392
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,740
in the scope of service.

393
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,740
The service area is about

394
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,740
5 zip code areas.

395
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,740
It's difficult to calculate

396
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,740
the number of villages on the previous table.

397
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Some services are as large as

398
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,740
two counties,

399
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,740
and some are as small as a building.

400
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,740
I use spatial analysis

401
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,740
to calculate the number of villages

402
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,740
on the previous table.

403
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,740
The spatial analysis is done

404
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,740
by county and county subdivision

405
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,740
based on U.S. census data

406
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,740
and American Community Survey.

407
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,740
The U.S. census data

408
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,740
shows that there are

409
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,740
more than 30,000 county subdivisions

410
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,740
on the previous table.

411
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,740
The U.S. census data

412
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,740
shows that there are more than 60,000 county subdivisions

413
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,740
on the previous table.

414
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,740
The U.S. census data

415
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,740
shows that

416
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,740
most of the volunteers

417
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,740
are local residents.

418
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,740
Most of the volunteers

419
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,740
are retired,

420
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,740
but there are also

421
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,740
a lot of young people

422
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,740
who want to work with us

423
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,740
to provide more resources.

424
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,740
So,

425
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,740
this is the return part.

426
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,740
So,

427
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,740
I use the U.S. census data

428
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,740
to calculate the number of villages

429
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,740
on the previous table.

430
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,740
The U.S. census data

431
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,740

432
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,740
income,

433
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,740
and the number of local residents

434
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,740

945
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,740
We still think about the government

946
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,740
and what services should be provided.

947
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,740
This is also related to your second question.

948
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,740
This is also related to your second question.

949
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,740
There are several stages of the elderly.

950
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
There are several stages of the elderly.

951
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,740
The first stage is that

952
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,740
many elderly people are still healthy

953
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,740
and have the ability to move.

954
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,740
The next stage is that

955
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,740
they may have some physical and mental difficulties.

956
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,740
The next stage is that

957
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,740
they may not be able to move in bed.

958
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,740
In Taiwan,

959
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,740
we are mainly discussing

960
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,740
how to deal with the later stages.

961
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,740
The elderly feel they do not need to worry

962
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,740
about the later stages.

963
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,740
This is a huge mistake.

964
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,740
It's like a machine.

965
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,740
It's like a machine.

966
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,740
You have to keep running

967
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,740
so that it can move smoothly.

968
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,740
you have to keep running so that it can move smoothly.

969
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,740
For example,

970
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,740
some people retire and do nothing.

971
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
Some people move with their children

972
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,740
to other countries or cities.

973
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,740
They watch TV all day at home.

974
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,740
They do not have social activities.

975
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,740
They can't quickly

976
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,740
enter the post-mortem

977
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,740
or the stage of mental decline.

978
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,740
It's all about problems.

979
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,740
How to take care of them.

980
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,740
How to take care of them.

981
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,740
We don't put resources

982
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,740
on how to give them more

983
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,740
when they are still healthy.

984
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,740
We don't put resources

985
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,740
on how to give them more

986
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,740
when they are still healthy.

987
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,740
I do interviews here.

988
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,740
I do interviews here.

989
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,740
I interviewed with senior people

990
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,740
who are in social activities.

991
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,740
Even when they are old,

992
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,740
even when they are old,

993
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,740
they will not stay in bed for a long time.

994
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,740
Even if they leave,

995
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,740
they will leave soon and feel no pain.

996
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,740
In Taiwan,

997
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,740
I think our social resources

998
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,740
should be more.

999
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,740
Or think more about

1000
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,740
this.

1001
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,740
As I said earlier,

1002
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,740
Village is a very flexible

1003
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,740
and flexible mode.

1004
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,740
So in Taiwan,

1005
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:36,740
I think we can connect with

1006
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,740
Taiwan's own social network.

1007
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,740
For example, in Taiwan,

1008
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,740
the elderly care is mainly

1009
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,740
based on the first one,

1010
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,740
the community development association.

1011
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
Mainly based on these two.

1012
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,740
Then I was thinking if Village

1013
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,740
can be combined with these two.

1014
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,740
In fact, in Taiwan,

1015
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,740
in terms of self-employment services,

1016
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,740
everyone's love is quite high.

1017
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,740
For example, in Taiwan,

1018
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,740
relatively invested in

1019
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,740
non-profit organizations,

1020
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,740
relatively invested in religion.

1021
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,740
Of course, religious organizations

1022
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,740
can also be combined with this.

1023
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,740
How to think about

1024
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,740
such a part.

1025
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,740
For example, on this table,

1026
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,740
the United States is facing a problem.

1027
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,740
In fact, these costs are quite high.

1028
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,740
Even if you are a middle-income person,

1029
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,740
even if you are a middle-income person,

1030
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,740
even if you are a middle-income person,

1031
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,740
once you get old,

1032
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,740
the source of income is reduced.

1033
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,740
And you don't know what kind of

1034
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,740
serious illness you might have.

1035
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,740
For them, it's a big burden.

1036
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,740
So that's why

1037
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,740
there's a reason for

1038
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,740
establishing Village.

1039
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,740
Like you just said,

1040
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,740
for example,

1041
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,740
there's another thing

1042
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,740
that's not listed here.

1043
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,740
It's nursing home.

1044
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,740
It's a nursing home

1045
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,740
that avoids that kind of situation.

1046
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,740
Especially in nursing homes,

1047
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,740
there are some

1048
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,740
medical care.

1049
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,740
There are some bad quality

1050
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,740
and a lot of mess inside.

1051
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,740
For example, assisted living

1052
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,740
in Virginia and Maryland

1053
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,740
has a retired community.

1054
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,740
But the costs

1055
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,740
are not too low.

1056
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,740
So if you

1057
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,740
just have a little

1058
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,740
inconvenience with some actions,

1059
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,740
for the most part,

1060
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,740
if you want to

1061
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,740
move to another place

1062
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,740
like assisted living,

1063
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,740
especially for

1064
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,740
the elderly,

1065
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,740
your social network

1066
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,740
will be cut off.

1067
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,740
And your social space

1068
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,740
will be more limited.

1069
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,740
So that's what

1070
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,740
the elderly in the U.S.

1071
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,740
are facing.

1072
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,740
So they try to

1073
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,740
stay where they

1074
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,740
used to live.

1075
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:56,740
For example,

1076
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,740
how to do some adjustments

1077
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,740
on the house.

1078
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,740
You just said

1079
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,740
that the costs are not low.

1080
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,740
I know that

1081
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,740
I checked on the Internet

1082
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,740
that the range of nursing homes

1083
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,740
is up to $100,000.

1084
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,740
So you said that

1085
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,740
the costs are not too low.

1086
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,740
What's the range

1087
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,740
in the U.S.?

1088
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,740
I've only seen

1089
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,740
more than 1,000 nursing homes

1090
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,740
in Virginia.

1091
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,740
Anyway,

1092
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,740
if I want to report,

1093
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,740
I can give you

1094
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,740
the statistics.

1095
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,740
Because each home

1096
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,740
is different.

1097
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,740
For example,

1098
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,740
the location,

1099
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,740
the unit,

1100
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,740
the profit unit,

1101
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,740
the situation will be miserable.

1102
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,740
Thank you.

1103
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,740
Thank you for your question.

1104
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,740
Do you have any other questions?

1105
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,740
I can stop the recording

1106
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,740
first.

1107
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,740
Then you can ask questions to

1108
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,740
the audience.
