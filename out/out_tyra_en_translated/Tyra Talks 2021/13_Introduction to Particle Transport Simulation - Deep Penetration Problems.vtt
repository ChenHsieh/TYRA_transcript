00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The first TerraTalk in 2021, today is January 9th.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
We are very happy today to invite Dr. Wang Mengren to tell us about his topic today.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
His topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation Deep Penetration Problems.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Before we start, let me introduce our speaker today.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
His name is Vince Mengren.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Let me introduce his background.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
Before this, he got his PhD in Nuclear Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2019.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
His main research interest is Particle Transport Simulation.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
This is the topic he will talk about today.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
There is another topic that is not today's topic, but it is very cool.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
It is Robotic Arm Applications in Nuclear Industry.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Obviously, you can't do anything by yourself.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
This is a very important application.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
There is a very special thing.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
This is our online speech.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome our speaker.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speaker can hear our applause.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Vince to give us a wonderful speech today.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll leave it to you.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Thank you, Ian.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to my speech.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
My topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Basically, Particle Transport Simulation can be used in many ways.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
My main focus today is Deep Penetration Problem.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I will introduce what Deep Penetration Problem is later.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
In fact, this chart has already told you some information.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
At first, I will talk about what Particle Transport is.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Why do we need Particle Transport?

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Second, what are the main applications?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
I just said that Particle Transport has many applications.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
If I have to talk about everything, I won't be able to finish it in an hour.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So I'm focusing on Deep Penetration Problem today.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's actually a shielding problem.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Basically, you need to have a method to do this simulation.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
There is a Governing Equation behind it.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Then you have to develop some methods to solve it.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I will talk about what the mainstream methods are now.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
What are their advantages and disadvantages?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
What are some more advanced methods?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Basically, I'm talking about Variance Reduction Techniques here.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Finally, of course, I will give a Demonstration Problem.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Finally, there is a Summary.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
Before we solve any problem,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
we have to talk about the Governing Equation behind it.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
The Governing Equation behind Particle Transport is the Boltzmann Transport Equation.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
You can see that the above equation looks very complicated.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
This is General Form.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You have Time Dependent Terms.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
We talk about Particle Streaming.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Your particle will be in Boundary Loss.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Then you may have an extra position.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
For example, if you are an electrolyte, you may have magnetic force.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Gravity is generally not considered.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Because the particle is very small.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Then you have Collision.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
The right side is basically Particle Gain.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
When we calculate the Particle Transport,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
We will talk about whether it is Lost or Gain.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You can see that the left side is basically Lost.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
The right side is Gain.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
I won't focus too much on Mathematics.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Because if you are not doing this field,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Mathematics will take a long time to understand.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
The above is General Form.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The following is basically

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
If you need to do radiation transfer calculation.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Calculate their mass.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
This is the Governing Equation we usually use.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
This is from the above equation.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
We talk about Steady State and Linear Boltzmann Equation.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
You can see that there is a word called Linear here.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Steady State should not need to explain, everyone knows.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Basically, what we mean by Linear here is

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
For example, if you want to calculate the mass today.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
For example, I am Photon today.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Photon will cause mass to me.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Today I assume that there will be no effect between Photon and Photon.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So this Linear is from here.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So you can see here

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Basically, it only looks like once.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
This is the function we want to solve.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
We call it Flux.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Basically, you can see that the above and below

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
These two equations actually look a bit like.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
The only difference is that one is General Form.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
The other is Specifically.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
We are not too independent and it is Linear.

05:17.000 --> 05:27.000
We can explain a little bit about what this equation is doing.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Just use this example.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
This example is basically if you go to the hospital.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
You often see these X-ray machines.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
This X-ray machine basically has a radiation source inside.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
The middle one is inside.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Basically, a general X-ray machine is a beam of light.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Basically, you can circle a boundary.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
If this beam of light runs out of this system.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I don't think about it.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Because it basically won't come back.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Basically, my patient may be here.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You basically have to estimate the number of patients.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
The beam of light that goes out here.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I just talked about streaming.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
This beam of light has run out of this boundary.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Basically, it is unlikely to hit back again.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
On the one hand, the energy you hit is getting lower and lower.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Its path will be shorter and shorter.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
So this is basically a little bit.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Just connect this equation.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
What is he talking about?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Take advantage of this problem.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
OK.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Speaking of Particle Transport.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Its application is actually very wide.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
What I just talked about is a medical radiation device.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Or a physical accelerator that is often used.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
You need to generate high energy particles.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Basically, you know that when the electric field is turning.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
You will put the light out.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Basically, you will need to design its radiation barrier.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
How do you design it?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
To make the staff at work.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
Don't let its dosage exceed the specified limit.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Whether it's nuclear fusion or nuclear separation reaction.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I basically need it.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Nuclear fusion reaction, if you need a place.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Basically, it's the same as I said.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
It's basically a high-energy particle.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
You cut it out again.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It will emit light.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Basically, you will have the same radiation barrier.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
The problem needs to be calculated.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Nuclear separation reaction is no longer necessary.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
From the core to the radiation barrier outside.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Basically, you need Particle Transport.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Here is a brief introduction to Deep Penetration Problem.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Basically, I just talked about Particle Transport.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
There are many applications.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Basically, Deep Penetration Problem is radiation barrier calculation.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
How much radiation barrier material do you need?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
In front of your staff.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Let your dosage reach the value you want.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
It's not too high.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem in academia.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Why do we talk about Deep Penetration Problem?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Because these particles need to go through.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
If it has to go through such a thick barrier.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Basically, this calculation is not very easy.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Generally speaking, if you are talking about radiation barriers.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
We will have an interesting example.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Basically, there are only three.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Mainly the first two.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Medium value and light value.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Basically, there is time for electrons.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Basically, when you need electrons.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Most of them are in medical equipment.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Medical radiation radiation source equipment.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
In the nuclear industry.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Basically, we do not consider this.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Because it is an electrolyte.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Then it's light.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It basically can't get out.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And the nuclear industry is basically.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
The barriers you don't see are basically very thick.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
So these two.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
The first two are basically without electricity.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So it's easier to get out.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Basically.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Basically, every calculation.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You have to have his goal.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Basically, we just talked about it.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
You have to protect the staff.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
And you have to calculate.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Know how much your dosage is.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Here I listed some of the general.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
The unit we will use for radiation.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
You can take a look.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
This is not directly related to the topic I am talking about today.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Just mention it a little bit.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You basically have some units.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
It is considered to be biological.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Like these are what we usually use.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Some of them are not.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Because you have these different particles.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It may cause damage to our human body.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Will be different.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Especially the seed.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
OK.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Ok, then.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
If we take a system to do.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Which one is.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
If there is a color system.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Let's do it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
For example.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
You can take this.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
This should be very necessary in Taiwan now.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Because Taiwan is basically.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Now the nuclear power plant is going to be established.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
You will have these radiation.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
In the process of loading the barrel.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
In the process of shipping.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
You basically have to.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Calculate how much radiation it will protect.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Basically, you can see.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Here is the nuclear fuel inside.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
These nuclear fuels are basically.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Burned in the reactor.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm talking about burning here.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Actually, it's not burning.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It is nuclear transmutation.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Yes, because basically the nuclear reaction.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's not the same as the general chemical reaction.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Yes, basically you.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Burned in the reactor.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
It's basically been activated.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Is being activated.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Then you basically.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
There may be these.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
These radiation.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
These radiation are basically.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Spent nuclear.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Is.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Used nuclear fuel.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Basically, it may be released.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Basically, you can't just.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Take it out.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Then.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Use people to operate.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
So basically it's all mechanical.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Then put it in these barrels.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
These barrels are basically very thick.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
That light inside.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Inside is the inner barrel.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Basically, that steel.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
That stainless steel is basically.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It's already 25 centimeters thick.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So basically there is such a thick.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
There is such a thick.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Radiation barrier.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
You basically have some particles.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
You don't need to think about it at all.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
For example, Alpha Particle.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Alpha Particle.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
You are basically in the air.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's about five centimeters.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
So don't say you have.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
You have a little bit.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Then Electron doesn't have to say.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It is very light and has electricity.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Then Neutrinos basically.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
It doesn't react with matter.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So we don't consider it.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
So basically.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Ah.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
We basically.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
You are in the nuclear industry.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
We have to calculate.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Ah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
If it's a measure.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Basically, most of them are these two.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And it's about 100%.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
The rest is basically.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
You can say it is negligible.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
It depends on the case.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
OK.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
So basically you can see that.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Because we only.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Only interested in this non-electric particle.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
So we just use this.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Steady linear.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Steady linear Boltzmann equation.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Basically, you can use it directly.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Ah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
To do this calculation.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
OK.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Ok.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Then you want to do this calculation.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
The physical model behind you has developed well.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
It is.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Ah.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Transport equation.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Basically, you basically have to.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
To solve this equation.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Ah.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
But that equation.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
You just saw it.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Basically, it has.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Ah.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
If you expand all the variables.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Include.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
If it includes time.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
It has seven variables.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Ah.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
XYZ.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Ah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Then the energy.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Then the angle.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Is the particle.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
What angle does it shoot?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Then.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
There are basically two angles.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
It has.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Ah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Z-multiple and polar.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
And then.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
It also has time.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Basically, there are seven.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Then it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
That.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
That.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
That.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
That.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
That.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
That.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
That.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
That.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
That.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
That.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
That.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
That.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
That.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
That.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
That.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Ah.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Ah.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Ah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Ah, basically, you can only solve the number.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
So, basically, the number is.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
This is the first deterministic model here.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You really have to go.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
This equation.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Break it down one piece at a time.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Then you can see it has a lot of.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
It is a square of space.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
It is XYZ.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
You have to break everything down.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
And then you have to break down the energy.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
And then there are two parts of the angle.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You have to break down.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
So, this is basically a module.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
It is a very difficult process.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
There is another method.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
It is basically a Monte Carlo method.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
You can put this whole.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
You can use this method.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Basically, you can.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
You do not have to go directly.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
The one who solved the equation.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You basically, we are.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
All the physical processes.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Turn it into a probability function.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Then go down to do the signal.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Basically, these two methods.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It has good and bad.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
So, basically, I am now.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I will talk about it next.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Where is it good and bad?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
And why is it bad?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Because it is a.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

13:38.000 --> 13:48.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

13:48.000 --> 13:58.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

13:58.000 --> 14:08.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

14:08.000 --> 14:18.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

14:18.000 --> 14:28.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

14:28.000 --> 14:38.000
It is a, it is a, it is a.
