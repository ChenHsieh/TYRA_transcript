00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
Welcome to today's TARTalk. We are honored to have Dr. Ronson to talk about his research on quantum bit during his Ph.D. class.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Before we start, let me introduce today's speaker.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Dr. Ronson graduated from Rochester University in the east of the United States this year.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
His work in his Ph.D. class is mainly to use superconducting man-made atoms to achieve protective superconducting qubits.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Before his Ph.D. class, he worked in the 3D IC department of TSMC for two and a half years.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
He just finished his Ph.D. class and got his degree.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
He will move to IBM Research as a Research Scientist and continue to develop and integrate his most specialized superconducting quantum chips.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
At the same time, he is also one of the members of the Qiskit Advocate of the IBM Q promotion plan.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
In addition to his main superconducting qubit research, he is also very committed to developing quantum education and games with Qiskit.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's welcome Dr. Ronson to give us today's speech with a warm applause.

01:17.000 --> 01:31.000
Dr. Ronson, thank you for giving me this opportunity to share with you.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
You can see my laser pointer.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Thank you.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
What I'm going to share with you today is my work at the Ph.D. class.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
There are three parts of my work at the Ph.D. class.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
The first part is Low-EJ's Josephson-Johnson superconductor.

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
The third part is the prototype of a quantum circuit.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
We call it bifloxone qubit.

02:07.000 --> 02:17.000
Because junction is a little boring, and there are some time constraints, I won't mention junction.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
The main focus is on the bifloxone circuit and a more important component in it, the superconductor.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Dr. Ronson is here again.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
This circuit is very similar to the bifloxone circuit.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
It's just that the black-shift junction is changed to a cooper-pair box, and the gate is used to connect.

02:39.000 --> 02:50.000
Because I do Fab, not design, I will try to explain the circuit.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
But there may be some Hamiltonian behind the theory.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Because of time constraints, I won't mention too much.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm not a specialist in quantum circuits.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
You can discuss any questions you have.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Because not everyone here is doing qubit, I will briefly mention it.

03:14.000 --> 03:26.000
In quantum computation technology, especially in qubit hardware, there are mainly five criteria.

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
These are the five criteria proposed by Dr. Ronson in 2000.

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
The first two are circuit depth, which is how long a circuit can run before the signal disappears.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
So you can put a few gates before the signal disappears.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
The other criteria is the number of qubits.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
So Dr. Ronson's work is more like de-extending the circuit depth of super-canon qubit.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
That is to say, try to increase our either coherent time or dephasing time.

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
Here is a recent meme, a web meme.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It summarizes the paper of super-canon qubit.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Now we can see that there are 12 kinds of papers.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
Dr. Ronson's work is basically located in these three papers.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
He wrote that Johnson and Johnson can do so many things.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is my first work.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
The second is to realize super-inductors, impossible inductors.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
The third one is our prototype.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
We made a new qubit and it is awful.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Just kidding.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
This is my work at Dr. Ronson's lab.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
The first one is super-inductors.

05:01.000 --> 05:10.000
We try to realize super-inductors with granular aluminum.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
The second one is super-inductors based on Johnson to realize bifluxon qubits.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The third one is super-inductors based on granular aluminum to realize bifluxon qubits.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
This is an ongoing project.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Maybe we can talk about it later.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
But today's main focus is these two.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Basically, this page is a brief introduction of Johnson.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Johnson is basically a capacitor.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Its two sides are super-conductors.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
There is a thin layer of aluminum oxide in the middle.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
In our device, we use aluminum-based.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
We use a shadow mask to grow an aluminum layer in one direction.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Then introduce some oxygen into the vacuum chamber.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Then another layer of aluminum is cut in the other direction.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
This is Johnson.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Johnson can be represented by three elements on the model.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
One of them will affect the resistance of the circuit damping.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
There is also a capacitor and a non-linear inductor.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
The characteristic energy of the capacitor and the inductor is

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Q2 over 2C

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
This is the energy generated by the Johnson effect.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Johnson effect basically describes

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
You can use the phase difference of the super-current on both sides of Johnson as a parameter.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
To parameterize the characteristics of the circuit element IV.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Its current and voltage can be parameterized by phase.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Then you can get its characteristic energy.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
In practice, what Johnson I did today

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
How much is the resistance of the two sides of the circuit?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
It is inversely proportional to Ej.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
Ej and Ec can be used in classical physics.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
You can think of it as the kinetic energy and potential energy in classical physics.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
Ej is like a potential energy in phase representation.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Ec is like kinetic energy.

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
When the quantity of Ej and Ec is in the correct position

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
When Ej and Ec are comparable

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Because of the quantum confinement effect

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
We can observe the generation of energy levels.

08:00.000 --> 08:09.000
In quantum computation, we take the first and zeroth connection to do the operation.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
For example, if the energy level is non-equally spaced today

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
You can use the microwave to address the ground state and the first excited state more accurately.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
This is the basic concept of quantum computation using superconducting artificial atoms.

08:31.000 --> 08:43.000
I just mentioned that Ej can be compared to kinetic energy and potential energy.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
In classical physics, we know that kinetic energy and potential energy

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Because of the mathematical structure of kinetic energy and potential energy

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
We can expect them to represent their own bases.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
For example, the kinetic energy base is the kinetic energy, and the unknown base is the unknown.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Therefore, P and delta P and delta X will follow the computational relation.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
You can expect them to have certain principles.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
There is a similar phenomenon in superconducting circuits.

09:20.000 --> 09:30.000
We use the basis of charging energy, which is the number of cooper pairs.

09:30.000 --> 09:39.000
And the basis of Josephine energy, which is the parameterized supercurrent phase.

09:39.000 --> 09:49.000
These two operators will also follow the so-called oscillating principle.

09:49.000 --> 10:00.000
In superconducting circuits, we are more concerned about charging energy.

10:00.000 --> 10:13.000
If we want to minimize the charge noise, we need to maximize the phase fluctuation.

10:13.000 --> 10:28.000
To maximize the phase fluctuation, we need to compress the energy spectrum into a parabola.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Therefore, we need a large inductance to flatten the parabola.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
In this way, we can get a relatively low charge sensitivity.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.000
This is why we want to make a superconductor.

10:49.000 --> 11:01.000
Traditionally, in semiconductor, the way to make a superconductor is to make a line.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
The thinner the line, the larger the inductance.

11:05.000 --> 11:14.000
Last year, there was a paper to demonstrate how large the inductance can be.

11:14.000 --> 11:24.000
This paper realized about 1 uH and 30 kΩ.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
The reason why kΩ impedance is an important parameter is that

11:29.000 --> 11:37.000
we want a superconductor to operate at a certain frequency.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
We want the superconductor to maintain an inductive response.

11:42.000 --> 12:01.000
That is to say, the operating frequency must be higher than the operating frequency.

12:01.000 --> 12:10.000
This resonant frequency can be used to equal 1 over square of LC.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
That is to say, if you have a large L and the corresponding F is fixed,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
your specific capacitance must be small enough.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
This will correspond to a high enough impedance.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
The reason why impedance is an important parameter is because of this.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
This paper demonstrates that it is already a limit.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Because the black part of the device is hollowed out.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
However, it is quite difficult to do this.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
To make a device of hundreds of microns in size and hollow out the substrate,

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
leaving only a very thin dielectric, is very challenging.

12:57.000 --> 13:06.000
Generally, we use superconducting kinetic inductance to do this.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Here is an example of what we do in our lab.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We use a material called granular aluminum.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
We will see a simple structure of it later.

13:13.000 --> 13:28.000
This material is provided by Cooper-Pear kinetic inductance.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
On the other hand, we use Johnson-Johnson inductance.

13:31.000 --> 13:46.000
I forgot the name of the professor.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
This is Professor Lin's lab.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
This is made by Maruchan and his group.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
This is the largest inductance in the world.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
It is 2.5 microhenry with an impedance of up to 200 kΩ.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
The way they do this is to remove the entire Johnson-Johnson substrate.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
It is similar to the concept of suspended graphene.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
After removing the oxide at the bottom,

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
and over-etching, the metal will rise up due to the force.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
By doing this, you can remove the substrate and get a very high impedance.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
This is provided by Johnson-Johnson superconductor.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
This is a simple description of why we need a superconductor.

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
These are some of the challenges we face in superkinetic qubit.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Whichever is smaller, either T1 or T2,

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
the shortest decoherence is not equal to Tg.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
The number of times a circuit can operate is the so-called circuit depth.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
What we need to do is to try to extend the circuit depth.

15:09.000 --> 15:24.000
The next thing I want to talk about is how to extend the circuit depth.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
One way is to use parity protection.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
The concept of parity protection is...

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Sorry, let me first talk about what T1 and T2 are,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
and what we are focusing on in this talk.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
T1 and T2 are a number in the NMR system.

15:43.000 --> 15:54.000
T1 refers to how long it takes for a qubit or electron to be excited to the first excited state,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
and how long it takes for it to relax back.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
If this is a block sphere in a qubit,

16:00.000 --> 16:11.000
the physical picture is that when you excite from 0 to 1,

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
after a certain amount of time, the ball will slowly shrink back to 0.

16:15.000 --> 16:29.000
Defacing is more like how to decoherence the information on the face of the xy plane.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
We are mainly talking about the relaxation of T1,

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
which is to say, how to suppress from 1 to 0 before 0 to 1.

16:44.000 --> 16:57.000
I have made a brief video on how to realize 0 and 1 in superconducting qubits.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
This is a device for charge qubits.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
It can be written as 4EC times the number of qubit pairs,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
which is the number of qubit pairs on the island.

17:10.000 --> 17:18.000
In this structure, we can see that when n is equal to 0,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
it means that there is 0 charge on the island,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
and when n is equal to 1, it means that there is 1 charge on the island.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
There will be individual parabola corresponding to this.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
For example, if you are 0 today, your energy should look like this.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
When there is 1 charge on the island, it looks like this.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
In fact, the energy is the number of qubit pairs you add up,

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
and the whole charge is your charging energy.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
If there is a charge running on the island today,

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
we expect that your energy will jump from here to here.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
For example, you have some quasi-particle tunneling.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
On the other hand, you will have some local charge noise.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
If you have some local noise today,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
your energy will jump from here to here.

18:12.000 --> 18:20.000
At this time, if I turn on Jordan-Johnson tunneling today,

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
I just saw that Jordan-Johnson is a capacitor.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
The energy diagram we expect looks like this.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
If I turn on Jordan-Johnson effect today,

18:33.000 --> 18:42.000
what we see is that we will have so-called anti-level crossing,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
and then you will have 0 state and 1 state.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
In this case, it is a similar situation in our system,

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
but we only use flux as the basis.

18:58.000 --> 19:06.000
What we are actually observing is the so-called flux zone.

19:06.000 --> 19:14.000
The concept of flux zone is the circulation in the circuit today,

19:14.000 --> 19:23.000
which is your super-current phase winding.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
For example, if you have a flux zone tunnel today,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
your super-current will have an extra graph,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
and your phase will have an extra graph wrapping.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
The concept of flux zone is used to...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
As I mentioned earlier,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
the concept of protection today is...

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Let's say we have a system today,

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
which is completely invisible to each other between 0 and 1.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
In other words,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I have a...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Let's put it this way.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Basically, if we play today...

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
Because of this Jordan-Johnson tunneling,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
what will happen is that it allows you to jump from 0 to 1,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
but you can also jump from 1 to 0 because of the coupling with the outside world.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But if we have a switch today,

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
we can put the system between 0 and 1.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Because in this case,

20:34.000 --> 20:41.000
let's say we have a degeneracy.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Basically, when I open 0 and 1 today,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
that is, when the switching system is in a different situation,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I can do...

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
When I want to read and write the system today,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I can do 0 and 1 writing.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
When I want to read today,

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
I can let the system enter the so-called protective state.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
At this time,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
the signal will be preserved.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
It can be preserved better.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I may not have done a good job.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
I tried to use the concept of degeneracy to explain,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
but the effect may not be very good.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
But basically,

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
if we write it down...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Vincent, sorry.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Vincent, sorry.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Can I ask a question?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yes, you can.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Hello.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Can I go back to the last page?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yes.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I want to ask you...

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
This seems to be a very basic thing.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
So when you do the rotational...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Because the part below you,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
minus one-half EJ,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
is your transition,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
right?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Then the above is basically

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
the amount of charge

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
on your island.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
If...

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
We discussed it last time.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
When you do it,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
you should also see some charge drop.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
It should be on the top.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
It affects NG here.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
So when you do rotation with approximation,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
it should eliminate the above.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
But if it's charge drop,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
the frequency it affects

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
will probably affect

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
the order of magnitude.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
My understanding is...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
I'm not doing charge qubit.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
But my understanding is

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
it's effective the same.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It won't affect.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Why?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
So the above...

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
4EC N-NG square.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
This basically turns it into frequency.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
So you want to do

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
rotation with approximation?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yes.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
OK.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
But...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
OK.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
But there's a shift.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
It affects the picture.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I think it's probably calibrated.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
OK.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
So let's say...

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
You usually put

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
1,000 electrons.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Then you jump an electron.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Your frequency jump

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
is about one-third of the jump.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
How much is that?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Two-thirds?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because it's N square.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So I don't know...

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I should say...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I think I should say...

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I don't know...

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
It's under rotation with approximation.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
In fact,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I don't know how to do calibration.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So I can't comment.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Sorry.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yes.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But my understanding is

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
it's...

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
In fact, charge jump

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
happens for a long time.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So we actually

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
don't really...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
If you really meet it,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
you're not very lucky.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
But we usually

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
take it as

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
the main calibration.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So we don't worry about it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It's just that it takes a long time.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
For example,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
10 milliseconds,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
you'll see it once.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
10 milliseconds, you'll see it once.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
But if you see it,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
because we basically do single shot,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
so we don't really worry about it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So I'm not very convinced.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Got it.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
OK.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
It doesn't matter.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Keep going.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Thank you.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
OK.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Sorry.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Then I'll...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I'll talk about it more smoothly

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
this week.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Because this week...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Basically, we...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Our basic concept is

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
we're in Flux on Parity.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm going to build a mechanism

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
in my circuit

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
to turn on and turn off

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
my protection.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Suppose I...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The concept of on and off protection

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
comes from what I just said.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Suppose it's a degeneracy lifting.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
That is to say,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
suppose my system has degeneracy.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Then I can somehow prevent

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
the degenerated ground state

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
between the two.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
They can communicate

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
between the two.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Suppose I have this ability.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Then I can do one thing.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
That is, I can

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
preserve the data

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
in the protected state.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
In the unprotected state.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
That is, I can disable this protection.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Then it has degeneracy lifting.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Then we can do

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
0 and 1 read and write.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Then this is a...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
a...

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
a concept.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Then our work this time is

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
a proof of concept.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Then we actually use

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the mechanism I just said.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It's the so-called Aruna-Kesher effect.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Aruna-Kesher effect is basically

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Aruna-Bohm effect

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
which is a dual version of Aruna-Bohm.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Imagine that

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Aruna-Bohm is

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
an electron in the gas.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Then there are some

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
non-zero vector potentials in it.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
When the electron propagates,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
it will have

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
destructive or

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
constructive interference

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
because of this vector potential.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Then Aruna-Kesher effect

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
refers to a fluxon.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
When it is tunneling,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
there is a junction on the left or right

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
to do tunneling.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
In the process of tunneling,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
how many charges

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
exist on this island

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
will have some impact.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
In the case of

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
a single electron,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
this tunneling will have

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
destructive interference

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
which suppresses the

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
tunneling of a single fluxon.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
The specific performance

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
in Hamiltonian

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
is that

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
there are two

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
degenerate ground states

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
in the optimized point.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
However,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
these two states

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
cannot see each other.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
This is why

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
we call it

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
parity protection.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
do you have any

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
questions

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
or

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
need to explain more clearly?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
If not,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
let's move on to the first part.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
The superconductor.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
The superconductor of quantum mechanics.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
OK.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I will continue to explain.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I just mentioned

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
how to

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
realize the circuit.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
A very important element

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
is to

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
make the

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
superconductor.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
The superconductor

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
is made of

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
granular aluminum.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Its microscopic structure

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
is like this.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
The red one is aluminum,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
and the green one is aluminum oxide.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
The way to

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
grow it is

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
to add some oxygen

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
to the argon plasma

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
during the sputter process.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Then,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
pressurize

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
about 1%

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
to 1%

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
of the concentration.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Then,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
we can get a structure like this.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
The grain size is usually

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
about 3 to 4 nanometers.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
This graph shows

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
the experimental data

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
extracted from

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
the literature.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
This graph shows

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the TCE and resistivity.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
We can see that

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
as the resistivity increases,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
the TCE

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
starts to grow.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The pure aluminum

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
is about 1.3K.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Then, it will grow to 2K.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
In different degrees,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
we can get different films.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
The grain size is different.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
The maximum TCE

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
can reach 3K.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
However, when we continue

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
to increase the resistivity,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
the TCE will not grow.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It will not have

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
the so-called

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
disorderly induced

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
SI transition.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Why do we need to increase

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
the resistivity?

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The reason is that

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
kinetic inductance

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
can increase

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
the resistance.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
This is the

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
experimental demo

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
of a sub-inductor.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
We basically made it

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
into a resonator structure

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
to measure its

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
resonant frequency.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Then, we can get

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
its inductance.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
We got an impedance

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
of about 30kΩ

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and an inductor

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
of 1.3uH.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Here are some details

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
about the application.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
This is the resistivity

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
as a function of oxygen flow.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
We later found that

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
the more accurate method

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
is to use a flow meter

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
instead of oxygen pressure.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
If you are interested in

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
the details,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
we can talk about it

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
in more detail later.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
The resistivity we made

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
can be controlled

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
by a flow meter.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
We just mentioned

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
that we made it

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
into a resonator structure.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
The black part is

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
the granular aluminum.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
The white part is the pure aluminum.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
We made it

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
into a resonator

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
of half-wavelength

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
called planar waveguide geometry.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Then, we threw it into the fridge

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
to measure its

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
resonant frequency.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
We extracted

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
the quality factor.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We further

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
characterized the quality factor

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
as a function of temperature.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
We got

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
a feature

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
of the quality factor

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
which is

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
a line

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
that does not change

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
with temperature

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
when it is

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
below 250kΩ.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
We observed

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
that it is

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
an exponentially

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
decaying

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
quality factor.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It is

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
similar to

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
the superconductor

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
in many disorders.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We observed

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
a two-level system behavior

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
at low temperature.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
At high temperature,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
we observed

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
a semi-regenerated

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
quasi-particle.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
What is the difference between

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
these two things?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
At low temperature,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
it is a two-level system.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
A two-level system

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
usually has

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
some non-saturated

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
or non-reactive

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
oxides or dielectrics

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
in the dielectric

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
when the film

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
is growing.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
These dielectrics

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
will produce

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
some local

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
electrical dipoles.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
They will have

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
some oscillation

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
with the

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
EM field

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
in our

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
micro-resonator.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
This will

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
cause an additional

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
loss.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
This loss

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
will not change

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
with the temperature.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
At higher temperature,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
a quasi-particle

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
will be produced.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
It is similar to

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
when you get closer to Tc,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
your couple pair

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
will start to break

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
due to temperature.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
These normal electrons

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
will reduce

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
your quality factor.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
These normal electrons

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
will produce

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
some excitation

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
from exponential

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
1 over kT

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
to produce a model.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
This is the so-called

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Martin-Spartan theory.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
So basically,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
our work here is to verify...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I have a question.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Do you have exactly

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
the same geometry

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
as ordinary aluminum?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
We are curious

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
about the difference between

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
granular aluminum

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
and ordinary aluminum.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
We didn't really

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
calibrate the two-level system.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Pure aluminum

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
has a

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
very low

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
kinetic doctrine,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
so

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
we didn't really

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
calibrate

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
the two-level system.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Oh, okay.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I understand.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I think

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
another

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
crude comparison

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
is that if you

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
make exactly the same feature

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
but ordinary aluminum,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
what is the difference

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
between your QI?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
If your QI is

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
TLS lost at low temperature,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
you can compare, right?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I think

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
the two-level system

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I just mentioned

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
is highly related to your QI.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
For example, if we make

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
granular aluminum,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I also suspect that our aluminum...

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Because granular aluminum

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
is built-in oxide.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
So will the material itself

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
have some two-level system loss

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
from the structure of the material itself?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
This is also possible.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Yes, I'm actually

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
worried about this.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Okay, I understand.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Okay, so...

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
The details

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
need to be more

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
detailed.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
It does require more detailed

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
analysis of the structure.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Because the two-level system is

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the source of

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
the NOES of OneOF.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
So

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
we need to spend more time on it.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
For example, for surface cleaning,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
we need to be more careful

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
and more detailed.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Right.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Okay, thank you.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Thank you.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And...

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Right, so basically

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
what I'm talking about here is

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
we are fitting two parameters,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
which are the parameters in practice,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
the results obtained in practice,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
which are my frequency shift and my quality factor.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Then I can get

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
a very good match,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
that is, the contribution of my loss

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
is basically

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
temperature-independent.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
At low temperature,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
it is temperature-independent

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
two-level system loss

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
that dominates.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
At high temperature,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
more than 250 mC,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I can see the sum of

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
the sum of the generated

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
quasiparticle that dominates.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes, this is a simple summary.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Okay.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Next is our

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
performance QP.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
This time we use

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Junction to do super-inductor.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It is closer to

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
what Meru and Quarren did.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Then,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
as we just mentioned,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
using quantum mechanics to do super-inductor

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
to build this structure

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
is still an ongoing process.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
In this circuit,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
how can this circuit

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
be mapped to this place?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Basically, you turn this 90 degrees,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
then these two junctions,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
these two red cross,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
then this super-inductor,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
half here,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
the other half here,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
then the last two sides

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
are connected to this.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
This thing turns 90 degrees counterclockwise,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
then it will be mapped to this graph.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Then connect to a radar resonator.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
This radar resonator is coupled

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
to a microwave line.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
This is a strip-line structure,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
not a coplanar waveguide.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
These are basically

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
how we do this device.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Then,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
the device parameters,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
what we do on the structure

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
is that we

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
use

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
our super-inductor,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
we can't do much in this device.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Basically,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I remember

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
this device is

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
less than a microherry.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
This device

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
is less than

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
a microherry.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It's not an ideal device.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
When our super-inductor

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
is not big enough,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
we still have

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
T1 protection,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
but our defacient protection

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
is not too big.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Basically,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
our T2 data

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
is about

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
1 microsecond.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
T1 can be

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
10 to 100 microseconds.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Our device

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
is

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
basically

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
a charge-sensitive device

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
because it has a coplanar island.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Then,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
in this device,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
we do

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
quasi-particle trap.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
The concept is basically

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
because we have

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
an island structure,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
we have three different

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
films,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
three layers of aluminum.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They are all aluminum,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
but they are made in different processes.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
These three layers

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
can be separated.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
These two are the same layer,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
and this is the other layer.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
We can adjust the thickness

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
to make the aluminum in the middle

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
thinner.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
The aluminum will have a bigger

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Tc, a bigger bandgap.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
This kind of structure

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
can make

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
the middle

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
island

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
have a bigger bandgap.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
So, the quasi-particle

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
is not easy to come up,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and suppress

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
the quasi-particle poisoning.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
It is simply controlled

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
by the thickness of the film.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Then,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
we observed that

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
in 8 hours,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
we only saw a few times

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
the quasi-particle

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
jump.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
The number of times is relatively small,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and each measurement

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
ends very quickly.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
If it is a time domain,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
it ends very quickly,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
so we rarely

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
encounter it.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Basically, we measure the data

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
and

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
this is a relatively impressive

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
place.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
If you don't do

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
quasi-particle trap,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the frequency of the jump

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
is about 10 ms.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
In our system,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
the shortest

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
is also about

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
10 ms.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
This

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
is our

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
frequency domain

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
of spectroscopy.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
These are

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
X01 transition,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
which is

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
the cubic spectrum.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
The blue data

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
is the

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
unprotected state,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
which is the

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
anti-level crossing.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
The orange data

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
is the

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
island bias 1E,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
which is 0.5.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
We see

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
degeneracy,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
which is the Arunacheshire effect.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
When we enable

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
the system's protected state,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
we see

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
degenerated ground state.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
When

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
we enter

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
0E,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
we enter the unprotected state,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
and we can do the reading.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
On the other hand,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
the linear fit

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
is basically

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
the super-inductor.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
We can get

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
the super-inductor

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
inductance.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Sorry, the inductance is

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
0.1 mH,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
not 1 mH.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
On the other hand,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
we observe

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
the

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
self-resonance

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
frequency, which is

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
0.1 mH.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
From this frequency,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
we can get the junction-based super-inductor.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Its impedance is

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
about 4 kΩ.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
The proof-of-concept

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
shown here

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
is how to

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
enable

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
the protected state

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
and

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
compare

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
the protected and unprotected state.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
This is the

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
microwave protocol.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
The y-axis

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
is the charge,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
which means

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I turn on

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
the protection

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
on i.e. bias 1E,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and turn off the protection

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
on i.e. remove the gate.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
What we do

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
is to let the system

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
be in unprotected state,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and then we

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
write the system into 1.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Then we turn on the protection.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
This is a 30-minute

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
pause to

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
turn on the protection.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
The duration is Δt.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
After Δt,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I turn off the pause

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
and read the system

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
to see whether it is in 0 or 1.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
This is the relaxation of the system.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
The delta is here.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
If there is no

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
gate,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
the T1 feed

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
is about 12 microseconds.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
When I turn on

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
the protection,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
the T1 can reach

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
100 microseconds,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
which is 10 times

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
the improvement.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
However,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
the T1 of this device

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
is still quite bad,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
which is only 10 microseconds.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
We can use

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
ArrayCatcherEffect

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
to demonstrate

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
that ArrayCatcherEffect

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
can help us achieve

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
a protected effect.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Basically,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
we verify

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
this graph

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
at different flux-biasing points.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
We can see

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
about 10 times

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
the improvement.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
The location of 0.3

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
is PhiExternal

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
and 6 PiExternal

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
are matched to

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
the read-out resonator.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Therefore, we get

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
0.3

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
or 6 GHz.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
These 6 GHz

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
are the

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
read-out resonator

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
frequencies.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
This is the

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
conclusion.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
We realize

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
a prototype circuit.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
This circuit

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
can have

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
a protective

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
mechanism.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
We can

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
enjoy

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
a short gate-time

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
while

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
enjoying a higher

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
improvement of T1.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
This is

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
the main topic of today.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Thank you to all my collaborators.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Thank you for your

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
participation.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm ready to take questions.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Before

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
the Q&A,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
let's give a round of

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
applause to Wen-Cheng

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
for his wonderful speech.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Of course,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
if you have any questions,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
you can

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
open the microphone to ask.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Is there

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
any question?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Actually, I have a question.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Let me ask a question first.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Sorry.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
OK.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Can I

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
ask you a question?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Sorry.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
OK.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Very nice talk.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
The result is

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
very exciting.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I want to ask

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
about

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
the following

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
work.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
T1 is

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
102 microseconds

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
under the protective state.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I want to ask

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
if you have studied

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
what limiting factor

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
limits it to

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
102 microseconds.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Yes.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Basically,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
it is...

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It is

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
junction symmetry.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
In short, it is junction symmetry.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
If the two junctions

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
are not symmetric,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
it will affect

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
the original T1.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Even unprotected state

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
will affect T1.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Yes.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I don't think

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I put it here.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Basically,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
if these two junctions

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
have either oxidation

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
or size asymmetry,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
it will

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
limit T1.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Is it different from

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
dielectric loss

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
limitation?

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Is it?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It is not caused by

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
two-level system.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
At least,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
in modeling,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
they know better.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
According to their feedback,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
in modeling,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
asymmetry will have a big impact.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Asymmetry can be

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
from our...

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
We can look at it

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
with a squeegee.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
We can

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
look at

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
asymmetry

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
at the lowest point

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
of the field.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Our equipment is bad.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
We make

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
asymmetry,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
put it in modeling,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and push it out.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
It tells us

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
our equipment is bad.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Or

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
maybe not.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The junction symmetry

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
is more particular.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
We must use two junctions.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
The asymmetry of these two junctions

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
is quite critical.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I have a question.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
What is your

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
asymmetry?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
For example,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
your asymmetry

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
can be parameterized.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
For example,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
in Squid,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
there is a defect.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
How much

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
difference

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
is there?

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Ideally,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
what is the difference?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
We use

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
gigahertz.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
0.6 gigahertz.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
So your

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
delta

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
is about

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
0.4 gigahertz.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I see.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
There is no difference.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Asymmetry

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
is a must

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
for junction.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Our

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
situation is

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
that

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
our device

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
must have these two junctions.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
You can't just make one.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
You have to have both.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
If you make one,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
there will be such a problem.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
The device

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
is particular about delta.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It takes time to tune.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
If you don't mind,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I have a second question.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Why your

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
super inductor

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
junction

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
is

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
a two-angle junction?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
It looks like

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
a rotating-angle junction,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
not a

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
stolen-bridge junction.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Unlike what we did

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
in Maryland.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Our boss doesn't like

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
stolen-bridge junction.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
He thinks

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
our junction

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
won't be broken.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So I want to fix it,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
but my boss says it's too slow.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Is your

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
blow-dry

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
like a trick?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
What?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Do you have a special trick

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
when you blow-dry?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I remember that

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
top-mask

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
was a PMMA

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
last year.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
It collapsed when I blow-dry it.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I couldn't finish it in 4 or 5 years.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
My boss told me not to do it again.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So I want to ask you.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
According to

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
normal

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
fab,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
our yield

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
is quite high.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
As long as

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
the first step is OK,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and the next step is OK,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
it's usually

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
not a problem.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
It's usually not a problem.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
No, we just can't do it.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I've been doing it for

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
a week, and my boss said

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
there's nothing special

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
to fix.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Nothing special.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
OK.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I see.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I'll let others

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
ask questions.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Thank you.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I have a question.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Can you go back to

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
TC?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
TC and

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
granularized.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
My question is

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
for different

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
samples,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
do you know

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
the delta

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
bandgap?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Is it almost

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
the same?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Or not?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I didn't test it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
But you feed

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Matisse-Bardini

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
and you get the value.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Oh, no, sorry.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
This TC is independent.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I just use it

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
to test TC.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Oh, I see.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So each data is

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
transported by TC.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And there's no microwave.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Matisse-Bardini uses microwave.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Right.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
So we don't...

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Suppose

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
there should be

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
a resonator chip.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Suppose

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
if it's 100% Matisse-Bardini,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
it should be exactly the same.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
But we're worried

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
because we don't know

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
how much of it is not Matisse-Bardini.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
We're curious.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Yeah, that's

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
a very good point.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
But in that case,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
if it's

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
what you want to do,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
you don't want it to be Matisse-Bardini.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You want the

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
alpha factor to be high.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
You want it to

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
deviate from Matisse-Bardini.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Not necessarily.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
But I hope

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
if it really comes from

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
the energy deposit,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
it can still break the pair.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Then I can test the documenter.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Otherwise, it reacts a lot

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
but it's useless

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
if it doesn't interact with the particle.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Interesting.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
OK.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
My understanding is

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
if it follows BCS,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
it's Matisse-Bardini.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
We haven't

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
thought about it.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
At least the first part,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
the alpha factor is good.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
We've demonstrated this part.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
As you can see,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
we want to test it because of this.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
But we're worried

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
if it doesn't interact

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
with the physical particle

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
in a normal response,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
it becomes a very powerful

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
but it only reacts with RF.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
It's useless.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
OK.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Because what I did before

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
is HKID.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The pair I read before

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
is more HKID.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I haven't thought about it.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
OK.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
OK.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
OK.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
As I said last time,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
in low resistivity,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
it usually follows

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
strictly

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Matisse-Bardini.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
If you push it

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
to close to 800

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
or 1000

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Michael-Henry per square,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
sorry,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
you'll get

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
a nonlinear phenomenon.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
It makes sense.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It's in line with the prediction.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
It's not Matisse-Bardini.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Yes.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
OK.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
This is my question.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Do you have any other questions?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
If you don't have any questions,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
please turn on

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
the microphone.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
OK.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Now I...
