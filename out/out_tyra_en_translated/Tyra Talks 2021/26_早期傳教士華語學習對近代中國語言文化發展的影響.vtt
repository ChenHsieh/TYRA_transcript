00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, thank you.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Thank you, everyone.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
I'd like to share my screen with you.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
This is the topic I'm going to talk about today.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
The influence of early Western missionary Chinese education on modern Chinese language and culture.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
First of all, this is a very new topic.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, it is my experience of studying the history of Chinese education in the past few years.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
Because it is the first time to publish, there may be some lack of evidence or some points of view are not mature enough.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
So I'd like to ask you to give me some feedback later.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Or you are welcome to contact me after the meeting.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
So thank you, everyone.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
In addition, I would like to thank my instructor.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Because the idea of ​​this topic is probably related to his leadership.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
That is, Professor Xin Shichuang.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
There is also my Chinese teacher, the instructor of the course, Mr. Gu Baili.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
This whole topic and some of the content is also the result of the cooperation between this teacher and the teacher.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay, so let's get into my structure first.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
The topic of my report today is roughly divided into three parts.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
The first is the preface.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
The second is the main part.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Discuss how missionary Chinese education affects the influence of this country's language and culture.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I will discuss it at about 6 o'clock.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
The third part is the conclusion.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
At the beginning of this part, I would like to explain to you first.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the influence of missionary Chinese education on China.

01:54.000 --> 02:04.000
But this topic focuses on the ideas developed by the missionary to learn Chinese.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Or his learning process.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Or some of his teaching materials.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
How do these things affect modern China?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on science.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
We will not discuss the impact of missionary Chinese education on painting and architecture.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
We will focus on the impact of missionary Chinese education on language learning.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Now, let's first understand how missionary Chinese education entered China.

02:30.000 --> 02:42.000
In fact, the spread of religion is very long and has a great impact on the interaction of various nations around the world.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
China's earliest external religious exchange was Buddhist culture.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
What impact does Buddhist culture have on China?

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
At that time, there was a lot of communication between Buddhism and Chinese in the Wei, Jin, Nan, and North Dynasties.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
This actually stimulated the development of Chinese linguistics.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Chinese linguistics is said to be four-vowels.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
One of the characteristics of Chinese linguistics is that we have a tone.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
In fact, it is influenced by Chinese learners.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
The second wave of religious transmission and language learning,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
the second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
The second wave of high tide is the part we are going to share today.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
The missionary Chinese education did not come from the West.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
However, what we are discussing today is the missionary of the West.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
Therefore, the earliest systematic Chinese-speaking ethnic group in the West,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
I emphasize that there is systematic learning of Chinese.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
In fact, Catholicism has been passed down in China for a long time.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
A while ago, there was a very famous TV series called The Twelve Hours of Chang'an.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Many people may have seen it.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
It talks about the Great Qing Jin religion.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
In fact, it is the Eastern Catholicism at that time.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It is based on Syrian literature.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
There is a Persian prince in it.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It represents the entry of Catholicism at that time.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
However, as early as the Tang Dynasty,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
there was already a translation of the Tantric literature version.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
However, the Catholicism has been in contact with China for a long time.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
In the Song Dynasty, the Catholicism has become more subdued.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
In the Yuan Dynasty, the Catholicism has reached another peak.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
We know that the Yuan Dynasty people have a so-called Sermon people.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
The Sermon people are Westerners.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
A story that everyone is familiar with is the Marco Polo travel diary.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Marco Polo is a businessman.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
He came to the Yuan Dynasty with some religious missions and met the emperor.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
Later, Pope Francis sent him directly to the Yuan Dynasty to make contact with China.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
However, these contacts did not really become a systematic study of Chinese.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
The real beginning of Chinese research is still at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
At the end of the Ming Dynasty, at the end of the 16th century,

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
the Jesuit Church was established in France.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
The Jesuit Church has a strong mission to preach,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
and they are willing to go to the distant Far East to explore.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
The second point is the great breakthrough and invention of the sea.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
The people we just talked about are all through the road,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
which we are more familiar with is the Silk Road to China.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
The road is very far away.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
This is more difficult and dangerous.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
The Jesuit Church at the end of the Ming Dynasty is mostly through the Silk Road.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
The Jesuit Church went from the Silk Road to Haowangjiao,

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
then to the Middle East, and then to India.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Let's look at the two peak periods.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
The first is the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the end of the 16th century.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
The second is the second peak period after the Opium War.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
In the early period, it was mainly the Catholic Church in Europe.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
After the middle of the 19th century,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
it was the new era of the Jesuit Church.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
The real long-term and continuous impact

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
is actually more concentrated after the middle of the 19th century.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Now let's see how these missionary Chinese studies have affected China.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
First of all, many of our friends online

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
are teachers and predecessors in the Chinese education field.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
How did Chinese education become an independent subject?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Today, many people think that

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
after the Second World War,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
it separated from traditional Chinese studies.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
In fact, it may have started to separate earlier, at this time.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
The original Chinese and Chinese studies,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
that is, the synology we are talking about,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
cannot be distinguished.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
With the arrival of Luo Mingjian,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
these people brought back a large number of Chinese classics

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and translated them into Latin.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Then it spread to Europe.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
We know that this is the Chinese heat of the enlightenment period.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
The Sun King Louis XIV was very fond of Chinese culture,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
especially the rise of rationalism.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
They found that the distant Eastern Empire was godless.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
They were very curious about the idea of ​​godlessness in Confucianism.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
So at that time in Paris,

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
the Chinese hot trend was the fashion of the upper-class society.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
So you have to wear Chinese silk, drink Chinese tea,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and discuss the Four Books and Five Sutras.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
This is the rise of Chinese Chinese studies.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
However, at this time,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
because China and the West did not have direct contact,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
Chinese studies at this time focused on the study of thought and culture,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
and there was no need for actual language communication.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
However, with the large number of Jesuits sent to China,

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
they actually began to come into contact with China.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
These Jesuits had a need for preaching,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
so they began to actively study Chinese.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Therefore, these Jesuits in China

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
began to independently develop language learning,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Chinese-language second language learning,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
into an independent subject,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
and made a distinction with Chinese studies based on thought.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
For example, Gu Saifeng and Dai Suiliang,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
who were the priests of the Jesuits,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
began to write professional Chinese textbooks,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
such as Chinese Introduction.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Next is the New Religion.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
The New Religion I'm talking about

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
is the so-called Christian religion.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
In the missionary history of the US Department of State,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
as you are familiar with,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Wei Sanwei also published a ten-chapter text in English.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
This ten-chapter ten refers to ten difficulties,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
from the most basic words,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
to the conversation in Chinese,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
to the final reading material.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
This is what makes Chinese studies

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
an independent subject.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
This is the first impact.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
The second impact is the development of Chinese-language language learning.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
In our traditional Chinese primary schools,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
as you are familiar with,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
the study of Chinese characters,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
is based on the study of Chinese characters.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
The emphasis is on the character,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
but the study of grammar has not been developed.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
For Western Chinese-language learners,

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
especially those with Latin and Romance languages,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
there is a huge difference in grammar.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It is very difficult for them to learn.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Even in the early days,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
when they were reading literature,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
the literature was very simple.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
In addition to the grammar,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
it was very difficult for them to grasp.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
They even mistakenly thought that

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
there was no grammar in Chinese.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Recently,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
the study of Chinese teaching history

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
has become more popular,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
so a lot of information has been discovered.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Some of the information that you may be familiar with

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
is probably on my side.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
There are some relatively new sayings.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
First of all,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
in the first book,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
a Chinese-language book

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
written by a teacher from Laihua,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
is written by Huankobo,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
the father of the Taoism Society.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
This book is actually dead.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It was because modern scholars

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
were studying the history of Chinese teaching,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and they found that

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
this book was mentioned

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
in the internal documents of the Taoism Society.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So it was designated as the earliest Chinese book.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
In addition,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
there is a book called

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Huangjialue,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
which is probably the first book

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
written in Chinese.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
There are many scholars in the mainland

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
who have been designated

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
as scholars

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
from China

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
to France.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Huangjialue is probably the first book.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
However,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
this book

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
was written in France.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Secondly,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
it was not executed.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
In fact,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
it was not widely promoted.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And is it written by Huangjialue?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
There is still some controversy.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So I won't talk about it here.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I will focus on the research of

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Western missionary language.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
The second book

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
is probably the book

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
that has become the conclusion

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
over the past few years,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
which is the book

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
of Wei Kuanguo's Chinese Literature.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
This book is written in Latin.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It was written in Latin

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
until the beginning of the 20th century.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Of course,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
it is now in English.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So almost all the early

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
letters in the church

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
are probably written in Latin.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
He wrote this book

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
in Chinese.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
This book is

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
circulated in the form of a manuscript.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
His manuscript

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
still exists

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
in several versions.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Several libraries

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
in the church still have it.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
One of the characteristics of this book

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
is that it discusses grammar

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
in the second and third chapters,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and for the first time

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
makes the difference between Chinese and Latin.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
The difference between Latin and Chinese.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
He also found that the characteristics of Chinese

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
are that there is no gender.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
There is no gender.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There is no gender.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
There is no

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
gender.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
There is no gender.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Let's take a look.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
There is another book.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Ten years ago,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
it was discussed

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
that Ji Wanguo's Chinese Guanhua Grammar.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
This book is

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
the earliest

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
widely printed

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
grammar book.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It was also

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
a very popular

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
grammar book

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
What has a deeper impact

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
is the Chinese Zha Ji

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
written by Ma Ruose.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
One of the characteristics of this book

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
is that the book was written

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in 1728.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
He had already first

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
studied the grammar of

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Chinese and Latin.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
In addition,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
in the analysis of the grammar of Chinese and Latin,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
the sentences he used

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
were a large number of sentences

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
quoted in the novel

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
At the same time, he noticed that

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
the words were divided into

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
real words and imaginary words.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
He kept some local dialects.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
For example,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
when he quoted the Water Tiger Diamond,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
he used a large number of Shandong dialects.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It is a historical

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
language

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
presentation.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It is a very real

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
grammar book.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Next,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
let's talk about the impact of this book.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
This impact is very direct.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
We are all very familiar with

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
the first Chinese grammar book

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
written by Ma Ruose.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The author of Ma Ruose

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
is Ma Jianzhong.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It can be said that

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Ma Jianzhong's writing of Ma Ruose

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
was influenced by the grammar book

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
of the Western missionary.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Let's take a look.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Ma Jianzhong himself was from Zhejiang.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
At that time, he was called Dan Tu.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Dan Tu is the name of a school

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
in Xuhui, Shanghai.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
If you are from Taiwan,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
you probably know that

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Xuhui High School

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
is the name of a school

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
in Luzhou,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Xinbei City.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
That's right.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Xuhui High School

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
is the name of a school

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
in Xuhui, Shanghai.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It is a middle school

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
established by

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Ma Jianzhong

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
in Xuhui.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
At that time,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Ma Jianzhong was also

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
a member of Xuhui.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
He was very familiar

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
with these French priests.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
He studied Latin grammar

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and wrote a book called

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Ma Shi Wen Tong.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It is worth mentioning that

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Ma Jianzhong's family

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
was Catholic.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
He had a very famous brother

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
who later became a monk.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
He was the founder

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
of Furen University

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
in Beijing.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Ma Jianzhong

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
was also a representative

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
from Europe.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Ma Shi Wen Tong

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
studied Chinese grammar

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
in a thorough way.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
He wrote a lot of books

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
about the grammar of words.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
He did a thorough research.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Ma Shi Wen Tong's book

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
was very helpful

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
in modern Chinese grammar

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
study.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It was influenced

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
by Zhang Shizhao's

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Middle Chinese Dictionary,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Li Jingxi's

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
New Chinese Grammar,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Lu Shuxiang's

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and Wang Li's works.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Next,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I would like to compare

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
the analysis

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
of the vocabulary

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
of Ma Shi Wen Tong's book.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The first book

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
is Wei Kuanguo's

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Chinese Grammar in 1651.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
As you can see,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
he divided Chinese vocabulary

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
into nine categories.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
We are all very familiar with it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Next,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Ma Shi Wen Tong's Chinese Dictionary

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
has six categories.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
What is special

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
is that

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Wei Kuanguo

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
into nouns.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The Chinese Dictionary

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
into nouns.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Ma Shi Wen Tong

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
classified the Chinese vocabulary

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
into nouns.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
He classified the Chinese vocabulary

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
into subordinate words.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
He studied the subordinate words separately.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Let's look at

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
the book

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
which has become

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Lu Shuxiang's

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Chinese Dictionary

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
in the early 1980s.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
He classified the Chinese vocabulary

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
into twelve categories.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
He added the subordinate words

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
and the subordinate words.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
We can see

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
that the Chinese Dictionary

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
which has been classified

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
for more than 300 years

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is still based on

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
the earliest Chinese Dictionary

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
in 1651.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The third factor

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
is the appearance

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
of Chinese alphabets.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
We all know that

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
the traditional Chinese alphabets

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
are pronounced in the opposite way.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
They are pronounced

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
in the opposite way

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
in Chinese characters.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
They are pronounced in the opposite way

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
in Chinese characters.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
This is the way

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Chinese alphabets have been used

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
for a long time.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
The Chinese alphabets

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
are classified into

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
the subordinate words

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and the subordinate words.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Therefore,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
it is very difficult

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
for a native speaker

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
to learn Chinese alphabets

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
or a non-native speaker

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
to learn Chinese alphabets.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
After Li Maodou

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
came to China,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
he first tried to

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
pronounce Chinese alphabets

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
but he failed.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
On the one hand,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
the Chinese alphabets

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
were changed

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
from the Ming Dynasty

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
to the Qing Dynasty.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
At that time,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
the Chinese alphabets

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
were introduced

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
from the south to China.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
In addition to the dialects

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
of Guangdong,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
the Chinese alphabets

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
were introduced

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
from the north to the south.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
At that time,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
the official language of Guangdong

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
was Manchurian.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Therefore,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
the Chinese alphabets

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
were studied

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
in different regions.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
The next one

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
is a heavy-weighted work,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
which is

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
the work of

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
the father of

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Genghis Khan.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
He studied the books

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
of the Ming Dynasty

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
and translated the Chinese alphabets

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
into

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
the Western

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
alphabets.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
He only used

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
25 alphabets

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
and 5 tones.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
At that time,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
the 5 tones

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
included the Chinese alphabets

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
so there was one more tone

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
than now.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Now,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
let's look at

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
the Chinese alphabets.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
This is the

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Chinese alphabet

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
of Sirurmuz.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Although it is not clear,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
it is presented

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
in a compass-shaped way.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
The Chinese alphabets

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
were translated

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
in the way of

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
putting the sound

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
inside and

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
out.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Let's continue

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
to look at

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
how the Chinese alphabets

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
of Sirurmuz

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
influenced the development

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
of Chinese alphabets.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Sirurmuz's significance

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
is that

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
using Latin alphabets

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
to analyze Chinese alphabets

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
has always been

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
seen as a complicated

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
and difficult task.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It has a great impact

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
on the later

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Chinese alphabets

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
such as Sirurmuz,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Sirurmuz,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Sirurmuz,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Sirurmuz,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Sirurmuz,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Sirurmuz,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Sirurmuz,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Sirurmuz,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Sirurmuz,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Sirurmuz,

21:52.960 --> 21:54.960
Latin and Romance alphabets

21:54.960 --> 21:56.960
had a big impact

21:56.960 --> 21:58.960
on the success

21:58.960 --> 22:00.960
of cutting alphabets

22:00.960 --> 22:02.960
of Chinese alphabets.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.960
Eulius Dirich,

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
the pope who came from

22:08.960 --> 22:08.960


22:08.960 --> 22:10.960
in the middle of the 19th century

22:12.960 --> 22:14.160
was an American

22:14.160 --> 22:14.960
who studied Chinese 싶은

22:14.960 --> 22:16.000
We know that

22:16.000 --> 22:17.760
Chinese characters are hard to learn.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.760
He felt that

22:19.760 --> 22:21.700
Chinese characters were

22:21.700 --> 22:23.700
unreasonable.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.700
So he wrote a paper

22:25.700 --> 22:27.700
in the Chinese Newspaper

22:27.700 --> 22:29.700
and he was the first to argue

22:29.700 --> 22:31.700
that Chinese characters should

22:31.700 --> 22:33.700
be replaced by Pinyin.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.700
The reason he argued

22:35.700 --> 22:37.700
was very intense.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.700
First, he thought

22:39.700 --> 22:41.700
that an excellent language

22:41.700 --> 22:43.700
should be Pinyin.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.700
He even said that

22:45.700 --> 22:47.700
alphabets,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.700
such as the Egyptian alphabet,

22:49.700 --> 22:51.700
should be replaced by Pinyin.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.700
He felt that

22:53.700 --> 22:55.700
Chinese characters should be

22:55.700 --> 22:57.700
eliminated from the

22:57.700 --> 22:59.700
progress of language.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.700
He also suggested

23:01.700 --> 23:03.700
that Chinese characters

23:03.700 --> 23:05.700
should be replaced

23:05.700 --> 23:07.700
by Pinyin.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.700
He said that

23:09.700 --> 23:11.700
Chinese characters

23:11.700 --> 23:13.700
are hard to learn.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.700
Chinese children

23:15.700 --> 23:17.700
should learn

23:17.700 --> 23:19.700
because

23:19.700 --> 23:21.700
Chinese characters

23:21.700 --> 23:23.700
are hard to learn.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.700
Wei Sanwei

23:25.700 --> 23:27.700
agreed with this argument.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.700
He continued to

23:29.700 --> 23:31.700
argue in the Chinese Newspaper.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.700
At the beginning of

23:33.700 --> 23:35.700
the Qing Dynasty,

23:35.700 --> 23:37.700
there were many

23:37.700 --> 23:39.700
intellectuals

23:39.700 --> 23:41.700
who recognized

23:41.700 --> 23:43.700
the old China.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.700
For example, Xuantong, Chen Duxiu,

23:45.700 --> 23:47.700
etc.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.700
Even Hu Shi

23:49.700 --> 23:51.700
said that

23:51.700 --> 23:53.700
Chinese characters

23:53.700 --> 23:55.700
should be replaced

23:55.700 --> 23:57.700
by Pinyin.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.700
This led to

23:59.700 --> 24:01.700
the famous

24:01.700 --> 24:03.700
Chinese-Latin movement

24:03.700 --> 24:05.700
in the early years of the Republic of China.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.700
Of course,

24:07.700 --> 24:09.700
the Chinese-Latin movement

24:09.700 --> 24:11.700
did not succeed

24:11.700 --> 24:13.700
in 2021.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.700
Because there are too many dialects in China,

24:15.700 --> 24:17.700
there is no way

24:17.700 --> 24:19.700
to use one Pinyin

24:19.700 --> 24:21.700
to represent all dialects.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.700
Second,

24:23.700 --> 24:25.700
there are too many homonyms in China.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.700
In addition, there is a difference

24:27.700 --> 24:29.700
between spoken Chinese and spoken Chinese.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.700
Without Chinese characters,

24:31.700 --> 24:33.700
there is no way

24:33.700 --> 24:35.700
to express it correctly.

24:35.700 --> 24:37.700
So Pinyin

24:37.700 --> 24:39.700
did not replace Chinese characters.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.700
However,

24:41.700 --> 24:43.700
Chinese characters

24:43.700 --> 24:45.700
were replaced by Pinyin

24:45.700 --> 24:47.700
in the 18th century.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.700
This is directly

24:49.700 --> 24:51.700
due to the influence

24:51.700 --> 24:53.700
of the Roman Pinyin

24:53.700 --> 24:55.700
of the Western missionary.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.700
Fourth,

24:57.700 --> 24:59.700
missionary Chinese

24:59.700 --> 25:01.700
has also improved

25:01.700 --> 25:03.700
the status

25:03.700 --> 25:05.700
of traditional Chinese literature.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.700
Chinese literature

25:07.700 --> 25:09.700
has always been

25:09.700 --> 25:11.700
about poetry.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.700
Poetry

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
can not be counted.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.700
However,

25:17.700 --> 25:19.700
the novelist

25:19.700 --> 25:21.700
has always been

25:21.700 --> 25:23.700
compared to the literati.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.700
From the Chinese characters,

25:25.700 --> 25:27.700
the author said

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
that the novelist Liu

25:29.700 --> 25:31.700
is a hearsay.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.700
He is not as good as Liu.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.700
This idea

25:35.700 --> 25:37.700
has been

25:37.700 --> 25:39.700
passed down

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
from generation to generation.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.700
The author did not

25:43.700 --> 25:45.700
accept the novel.

25:45.700 --> 25:47.700
He did not accept the novel

25:47.700 --> 25:49.700
of Zhang Hui.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.700
He accepted the short stories

25:51.700 --> 25:53.700
of the literary world.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.700
However,

25:55.700 --> 25:57.700
he did not accept the four great novels.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.700
Why?

25:59.700 --> 26:01.700
Because he felt that the four great novels

26:01.700 --> 26:03.700
were very vulgar.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.700
However,

26:05.700 --> 26:07.700
after the Western missionary

26:07.700 --> 26:09.700
came to China,

26:09.700 --> 26:11.700
he made a big change.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.700
In French literature,

26:13.700 --> 26:15.700
novels and plays

26:15.700 --> 26:17.700
are very important.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.700
The Chinese literature of France

26:19.700 --> 26:21.700
started to pay attention

26:21.700 --> 26:23.700
to Chinese novels and plays

26:23.700 --> 26:25.700
very early on.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.700
The missionary

26:27.700 --> 26:29.700
also found that

26:29.700 --> 26:31.700
the novels of Zhang Hui

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
and Baihua

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
were very rich in

26:35.700 --> 26:37.700
folk customs

26:37.700 --> 26:39.700
and life records.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.700
Therefore,

26:41.700 --> 26:43.700
the missionary

26:43.700 --> 26:45.700
started to use

26:45.700 --> 26:47.700
the novels of Zhang Hui

26:47.700 --> 26:49.700
as a Chinese textbook.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.700
In the book

26:51.700 --> 26:53.700
of Ma Ruose,

26:53.700 --> 26:55.700
he used the sentences

26:55.700 --> 26:57.700
of the novels of Zhang Hui

26:57.700 --> 26:59.700
as an example.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.700
Let's take a look

27:01.700 --> 27:03.700
at the book of Ma Ruose.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.700
The French priest

27:05.700 --> 27:07.700
of the Jesuit Church

27:07.700 --> 27:09.700
named Andre Gaulle

27:09.700 --> 27:11.700
translated the book

27:11.700 --> 27:13.700
of Ma Ruose

27:13.700 --> 27:15.700
as a textbook.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.700
He translated

27:17.700 --> 27:19.700
the book of Ma Ruose

27:19.700 --> 27:21.700
as a textbook.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.700
He translated the book

27:23.700 --> 27:25.700
of Ma Ruose

27:25.700 --> 27:27.700
as a textbook.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.700
Ma Ruose

27:29.700 --> 27:31.700
also translated

27:31.700 --> 27:33.700
the book of Ma Ruose

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
as a textbook.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.700
He translated the book

27:37.700 --> 27:39.700
of Ma Ruose

27:39.700 --> 27:41.700
as a textbook.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.700
In addition,

27:43.700 --> 27:45.700
the missionary

27:45.700 --> 27:47.700
from the United States

27:47.700 --> 27:49.700
named Wittema

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
translated the book

27:51.700 --> 27:53.700
of Ma Ruose

27:53.700 --> 27:55.700
as a textbook.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.700
Wittema

27:57.700 --> 27:59.700
translated the book

27:59.700 --> 28:01.700
of Ma Ruose

28:01.700 --> 28:03.700
as a textbook.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.700
In addition,

28:05.700 --> 28:07.700
the missionaries

28:07.700 --> 28:09.700
from the West

28:09.700 --> 28:11.700
also tried to

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
create novels of Zhang Hui.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.700
For example,

28:15.700 --> 28:17.700
Ma Ruose

28:17.700 --> 28:19.700
wrote a novel

28:19.700 --> 28:21.700
about Confucianism

28:21.700 --> 28:23.700
with the purpose

28:23.700 --> 28:25.700
of teaching.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.700
The missionaries

28:27.700 --> 28:29.700
from the West

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700
were interested

28:31.700 --> 28:33.700
in the novel

28:33.700 --> 28:35.700
of Zhang Hui.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.700
The missionaries

28:37.700 --> 28:39.700
were interested

28:39.700 --> 28:41.700
in the novel

28:41.700 --> 28:43.700
of Zhang Hui.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.700
Especially,

28:45.700 --> 28:47.700
the missionaries

28:47.700 --> 28:49.700
from the West

28:49.700 --> 28:51.700
were close

28:51.700 --> 28:53.700
to the Chinese

28:53.700 --> 28:55.700
and were interested

28:55.700 --> 28:57.700
in the novel

28:57.700 --> 28:59.700
of Zhang Hui.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.700
The missionaries

29:01.700 --> 29:03.700

29:03.700 --> 29:05.700
were close

29:05.700 --> 29:07.700

29:07.700 --> 29:09.700
and were interested

29:17.700 --> 29:19.700
were close

29:19.700 --> 29:21.700

29:45.700 --> 29:47.700

but I'd like to ask

40:11.700 --> 40:13.700
them later.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.700
I'd like to ask them later.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.700
I think

40:21.700 --> 40:23.700
I'd like to ask

40:23.700 --> 40:25.700
questions

40:25.700 --> 40:27.700
like

40:27.700 --> 40:29.700
the question

40:29.700 --> 40:31.700
of

40:31.700 --> 40:33.700
Ning Shen.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.700
Because

40:35.700 --> 40:37.700
you mainly talk about

40:37.700 --> 40:39.700
the missionaries from the West.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.700
I'd like to know

40:41.700 --> 40:43.700
how you define

40:43.700 --> 40:45.700
the missionaries

40:45.700 --> 40:47.700
from the West.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.700
I'd like to know

40:49.700 --> 40:51.700
how you define

40:51.700 --> 40:53.700
the missionaries

40:53.700 --> 40:55.700
from the West.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.700
I know

40:57.700 --> 40:59.700
some of them

40:59.700 --> 41:01.700
are from different countries

41:01.700 --> 41:03.700
and some of them

41:03.700 --> 41:05.700
are from different countries

41:05.700 --> 41:07.700
and some of them

41:07.700 --> 41:09.700
are from different countries

41:09.700 --> 41:11.700
and some of them

41:11.700 --> 41:13.700
are from different countries

41:13.700 --> 41:15.700
and some of them

41:15.700 --> 41:17.700
have different accents

41:17.700 --> 41:19.700
and accents.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.700
Do you think

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
their analysis

41:23.700 --> 41:25.700
of Chinese

41:25.700 --> 41:27.700
has an impact?

41:27.700 --> 41:29.700
Because, as you said,

41:29.700 --> 41:31.700
their main purpose

41:31.700 --> 41:33.700
is to preach.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.700
Their main purpose

41:35.700 --> 41:37.700
is to preach.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.700
I talked about

41:39.700 --> 41:41.700
their interpretation

41:41.700 --> 41:43.700
of the Bible

41:43.700 --> 41:45.700
to help them preach

41:45.700 --> 41:47.700
and communicate.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.700
But before that,

41:49.700 --> 41:51.700
because the Chinese culture

41:51.700 --> 41:53.700
and language

41:53.700 --> 41:55.700
flowed into

41:55.700 --> 41:57.700
Europe

41:57.700 --> 41:59.700
and they

41:59.700 --> 42:01.700
read written language

42:01.700 --> 42:03.700
and read written language

42:03.700 --> 42:05.700
instead of conversation.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.700
instead of conversation.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.700
I'd like to know

42:09.700 --> 42:11.700
because...

42:11.700 --> 42:13.700
What's my question?

42:13.700 --> 42:15.700
Because their purpose

42:15.700 --> 42:17.700
is different.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.700
I'd like to know

42:19.700 --> 42:21.700
if this has an impact

42:21.700 --> 42:23.700
on their Chinese learning

42:23.700 --> 42:25.700
and analysis.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.700
If you want

42:27.700 --> 42:29.700
to read literature

42:29.700 --> 42:31.700
and analyze literature,

42:31.700 --> 42:33.700
the emphasis is different.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.700
Is there a mismatch?

42:35.700 --> 42:37.700
Is there a mismatch?

42:37.700 --> 42:39.700
Next,

42:39.700 --> 42:41.700
as you mentioned,

42:41.700 --> 42:43.700
they've been

42:43.700 --> 42:45.700
learning Chinese

42:45.700 --> 42:47.700
in different places

42:47.700 --> 42:49.700
for a long time.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.700
for a long time.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.700
As you mentioned,

42:53.700 --> 42:55.700
there's a Shandong dialect.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.700
There's a Shandong dialect.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.700
Francesco Varo,

42:59.700 --> 43:01.700
a Spanish missionary,

43:01.700 --> 43:03.700
he read

43:03.700 --> 43:05.700
the White Paper

43:05.700 --> 43:07.700
in 1728.

43:07.700 --> 43:09.700
It's a Shandong dialect.

43:09.700 --> 43:11.700
So, I'd like to know...

43:11.700 --> 43:13.700
He read it in Shandong dialect.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.700
He read it in Shandong dialect.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.700
So, I'd like to know...

43:17.700 --> 43:19.700
I'd like to know...

43:19.700 --> 43:21.700
I'd like to know...

43:21.700 --> 43:23.700
I'd like to know...

43:23.700 --> 43:25.700
I'd like to know...

43:25.700 --> 43:27.700
I'd like to know...

43:27.700 --> 43:29.700
I'd like to know...

43:29.700 --> 43:31.700
I'd like to know...

43:31.700 --> 43:33.700
How does learning Chinese

43:33.700 --> 43:38.700
affect their

43:38.700 --> 43:40.700
Chinese learning?

43:40.700 --> 43:42.700
How does learning Chinese

43:42.700 --> 43:44.700
affect their

43:44.700 --> 43:46.700
Korean learning?

43:46.700 --> 43:49.700
