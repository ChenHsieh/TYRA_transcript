00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, I'm Annie, and I'm honored to have Ian here to give us an amazing talk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ian is a PhD candidate at Cornell University.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today's topic is called Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today's talk will be about 40-45 minutes, with a 10-15 minute Q&A.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The recording will be uploaded to Taira's YouTube channel or blog in about a week.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Ian.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you, Annie.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not a PhD candidate yet, but I hope to be one soon.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm very happy to be here today, especially with the support of my Taiwanese friends.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll try to be more introverted, and introduce the topic to those unfamiliar with it.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll start by sharing my screen.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can everyone see the video?

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, I can.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you can't see the video, please let me know.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today's topic is Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In Chinese, the word oblivious refers to an ignorant person, or a person who has no awareness.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a difficult word, so it's normal if you don't know it.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm Ian Su.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm a postdoctoral student at Cornell University.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm currently studying Human Development.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll be joining the Department of Psychology.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is a project I'm working on with Cornell Law School.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Today's talk will be divided into three parts.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In the first part, we'll go over the background of Killing the Oblivious.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In the second part, we'll look at what the project is about.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In the third part, I'll talk about how the project combines psychology and law.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll use a simple way to explain how we view food.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll start with the first part.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The reason I'm doing this research is because

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was a lawyer in Taiwan two years before I came to Cornell.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
During my time as a lawyer, I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I didn't choose to be involved in these cases,

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
because my major was Law.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My master's was Psychology.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was fortunate to be a lawyer with a background in both psychology and law.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Many of the defendants were mentally ill.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The reason I came to Cornell Law School

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is because I had a five-year Ph.D. program in psychology,

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but they have a very strong cross-field discipline.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They have a dual degree program.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The professors here are very strong,

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and they like to combine psychology, law, and research topics.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Although I didn't mention the six-year dual degree program on the screen,

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
my professor told me that I already had a law degree in Taiwan,

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so I didn't need to come to the U.S. to study law.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What I'm actually doing is trying to combine the law and psychology that I learned in the past

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and see how I can use my research to study legal issues.

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The reason I started the killing the oblivious project

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is because the two professors above me are professors in the Department of Human Development.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They know that I had experience in the death penalty defense in Taiwan,

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
so they strongly recommended that I go to Professor John Bloom of Cornell Law School.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and he is probably the most famous death penalty defense lawyer in the U.S.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For example, he went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend himself eight times.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
For a lawyer in the U.S., this must be a very difficult experience.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So I went to Professor John Bloom and asked him if he had any interesting topics that we could work on together.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Professor John Bloom is currently the Director of the Cornell Law School's Death Penalty Project.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Law schools in the U.S. usually have to study for three years,

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and in the first two years, students will look for the so-called legal aid,

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the so-called legal aid clinic course,

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and students will usually choose a certain professor to lead the clinic

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and hold a special case for this professor.

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
so his legal aid clinic is also a case related to death penalty defense.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So he has been working on this relevant topic.

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And because death penalty is very special,

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
it is often intertwined with many psychological or psychological issues.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So these two books are some of the books he helped with.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Professor John Bloom studies death penalty from a lawyer's point of view.

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In the process of death penalty,

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
he may often come into contact with some so-called intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So he may use a more legal perspective to discuss or observe these things.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Today, we will not discuss the nature of death penalty,

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but will focus on one of the issues from a purely academic point of view.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Cornell is quite special.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In addition to focusing on local death cases in the United States,

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he also has another center that looks at the death penalty all over the world.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
For example, they are currently looking at how to look at it from a more human perspective,

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
even if it is death penalty.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Some countries may lack the so-called legal procedure for the execution of death penalty.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For example, Cornell's Law School is currently helping some African countries

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to reform the execution method of death penalty or related laws.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So this is probably why I am in contact with death penalty-related psychological research here at Cornell.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because he originally had these faculty members doing these researches.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now we come to the main topic, what is Killing a Belief?

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is he going to discuss?

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The first part is that this research is about criminal liability.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You may think that this ability is abstract.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Basically, in the general criminal litigation process,

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because you can imagine that in Taiwan, Taiwan is a three-level, three-provincial system.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So if there is a criminal case today, and it involves a death penalty,

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
for example, a more serious case, such as murder,

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it will go all the way from the local court to the high court to the Supreme Court.

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The situation in the United States is similar.

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In this process, in addition to the judge going to interrogate some facts,

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the judge must also pay attention to whether the parties in the process have the ability to arrest the parties.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So in the U.S. judicial process, including Taiwan, there is a similar law.

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Usually, I list the four basic abilities that the parties need to have.

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The first is that the parties must have the ability to interrogate.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That is to say, at least he needs to know what the court process means,

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and what the role of each person is.

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The second ability is competency to plead guilty.

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That is to say, if he pleads guilty, does it count?

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If he is mentally ill, does he have the ability to plead guilty for himself?

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The third ability is competency to waive the right to counsel.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In the United States, it is more special that these serious crimes are not necessarily forced defense cases.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That is to say, the government does not necessarily need to help him get a lawyer.

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In this case, or if it is a forced defense case,

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
can the parties say, I think I have the ability to defend myself,

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
can I waive the counsel?

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't need a lawyer to help me.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If a party makes such a statement, is it an effective statement?

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The last ability is competency for execution.

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This ability is very specific, only in criminal cases.

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That is the topic we will focus on today.

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Competency for execution means that if a case involves execution,

119
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in the end, he is sentenced to death,

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and after being sentenced to death,

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that is to say, this person is already in the so-called death penitentiary.

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He also obtained an execution date,

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that is to say, maybe the state government has issued a date of execution,

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
where and how he will be executed.

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In this case,

126
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
he himself or his defense team can help him fight for

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that this person may not have the ability to be executed.

128
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We will explain later why the ability to be executed is needed.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
For example, he may have serious mental disorders, etc.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is also equivalent to the judicial procedure,

131
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
if it involves an execution case,

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
he will need the ability to be sentenced in the end.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We will focus on the last one today,

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
competency for execution.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In Taiwan, the current method is more like the ability to be executed.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
At present, Taiwan's execution method is also being revised.

137
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It should be revised recently.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This ability is quite interesting.

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It originates from the U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment.

140
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment also states that

141
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
there is no way to tolerate

142
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
a cruel or unusual way of punishment.

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Whether in Taiwan or the U.S.,

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
execution is a way to punish criminals.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, in the U.S. judicial discussion,

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
if it is related to execution,

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it is usually quoted in the sentence of the 8th amendment of the Constitution

148
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to discuss the execution.

149
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
For example, the most common discussion may be the purgatory,

150
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
where the execution is considered unethical or cruel.

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
As for the specific method of execution,

152
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the U.S. Supreme Court has three very decisive judgments.

153
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They are Fort, Penelope, and Madison.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Today, we will introduce these three judgments.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why do we need to discuss them?

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The reason why we need to do this research is because

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
although I just explained competency for execution,

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it is a legal ability that judges need to consider.

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But in fact, its standards are very self-explanatory.

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Although in the past Supreme Court judgments,

161
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
it said that to have the ability to be executed,

162
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you must be able to understand the facts in a rational way.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What is execution?

164
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And why are you sentenced to death?

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Or why are you sentenced to death?

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And when this person accepts the relevant judicial procedures for execution,

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
he must have the ability to help his lawyer.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Although the court has these two standards,

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
how do you actually,

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
for example, if a psychologist or psychiatrist,

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
how do they operate this standard is very self-explanatory.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Next, we will go through these three judgments

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and talk about what impact these three judgments have on competency for execution.

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Before we talk about the judgment,

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can give you an overview of what the U.S. execution procedure is like.

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a bit similar to Taiwan.

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So let's start with the column on the far left.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Generally speaking, the three columns on the left are very similar to Taiwan's three-level three-judgment system.

179
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The bottom left is similar to our local courts.

180
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then the top left is the Supreme Court,

181
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and the top right is the Supreme Court.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So generally speaking, the death sentence will almost always end

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
at the three levels of the column on the left.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because it's a more serious crime,

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and it may be related to life.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Generally speaking, if we take Taiwan or the U.S. as an example,

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
sentences that are not related to execution usually end at the column on the far left.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But if it's a death sentence,

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
they also have the so-called re-trial system,

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
which is the middle column.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The re-trial system also usually has the concept of the so-called three-level three-judgment,

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
which may reach the Supreme Court all the way.

193
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Re-trial means that the court may want to review some new evidence,

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
or new facts, or new reasons, etc.

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Each has different regulations.

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But simply put, it's not like the first column is over.

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It will go to the second column.

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Even most death sentences may go to the third column.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The third column is very special in the U.S.,

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
which is related to the part of the life protection order.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It means that because the death sentence is a serious crime,

202
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
so they are in the process of the entire legal process.

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They are almost all locked up in the so-called death cell,

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
or in the confinement cell.

205
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is equivalent to locking people up.

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So as long as it's locked up with people,

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it may involve a violation of the law.

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
According to the U.S. law,

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
people can go through a three-level three-judgment system

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
based on the issue of life protection.

211
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So if a U.S. death sentence is a serious crime,

212
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
there will usually be the so-called nine steps.

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is about five to ten years on average.

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So the process of execution is very long.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You might imagine that

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
if a person may have a mental disorder

217
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
or a lack of mental intelligence,

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
the process of nine years is actually very dynamic.

219
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And because if they are all in the so-called prison,

220
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
or if they are suppressed in some organs,

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and the medical environment may not be so good,

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
their mental state may deteriorate.

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is a very common case in the U.S. death cell.

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Even if they have been sentenced to death,

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it may be a very, very long process

226
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
from the day of execution to the day of execution.

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So the death sentence in the U.S.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
is a problem that many people will discuss.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The death sentence in the U.S.

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
has a huge number of people,

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
with thousands of people in each unit.

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And the number of people on duty

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is also thousands of people in each unit.

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So it's less than 60 people

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in the current death sentence in Taiwan.

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is a big difference in the number of people.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So this is to show you

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the process of execution in the U.S.

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are about three parts,

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and there are nine steps.

241
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The earliest sentence is called the Ford sentence.

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was the first time in the U.S. Supreme Court

243
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to discuss the death sentence,

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because the law stipulates

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
how we should deal with it.

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mr. Ford himself,

247
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
he committed the crime of killing a police officer.

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
In the process of execution,

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
it should be said that

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
in the process of case trial,

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
he had schizophrenia,

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and he had some obvious delusions.

253
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
For example, he had a delusion

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that the U.S. was involved

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in racial discrimination

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
with the 3K Party.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So in the end,

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
he went through the nine steps

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
that I just mentioned.

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And then his lawyer

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
helped him file

262
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the so-called claim

263
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
for the ability to be executed.

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The challenge is that

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
he may not be able to be executed

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because he had schizophrenia.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He had a very serious delusion.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
At that time,

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the judge said

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
that they didn't judge

271
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Mr. Ford directly

272
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
whether he was crazy

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
enough to completely lose

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the ability to be executed.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But they gave a rough definition.

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In other words,

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
as long as the person

278
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
who was executed

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
had the rational ability

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
to understand

281
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
his execution

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and his reason,

283
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
we would say that he was capable.

284
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
On the contrary,

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
he may not be able to be executed.

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This was a judgment

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
about 40 or 50 years ago in 1986.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
After the Supreme Court

289
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
made this judgment,

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
he said,

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
okay, we have finished the definition.

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then he threw it back

293
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to the lower court

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
to judge

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
whether Mr. Ford

296
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
was capable of being executed

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
or not.

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Unfortunately,

299
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mr. Ford passed away

300
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
due to other reasons.

301
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
At that time,

302
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it was not clear

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
how to operate this definition.

304
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It seemed that

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
everything was possible,

306
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
but in practice,

307
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
it seemed that

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Ford was not capable

309
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
of being executed.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So many cases

311
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
were failed.

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
After 20 years,

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
there was a second judgment

314
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
called Panetti v. Quarterman

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
in 2007.

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It was a judgment

317
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
after 20 years.

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It was a similar situation

319
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
where the person

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
had a long history

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
of visual impairment

322
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
for example,

323
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
he wore western jeans

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and helped his lawyer

325
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to open the court.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He may decide

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
to call many different witnesses,

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
such as the deceased

329
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
President of the United States

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or Jesus,

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to be the witness of his case,

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
which is not related

333
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
to the case itself.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
In this judgment,

335
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the judge

336
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
re-explained

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the long history

338
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
of the previous judgment

339
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
in detail.

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
However,

341
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
this time,

342
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the judge

343
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
re-explained

344
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the reason

345
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
for the execution

346
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and the reason

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
for the sentence.

348
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In this case,

349
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the execution

350
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
is meaningless

351
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
because the judge

352
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
should be responsible

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
for what he did.

354
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If the judge

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
can't understand

356
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
what he did wrong,

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
there is no way

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
for the execution

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
to work.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Therefore,

361
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
when Panetti v. Quarterman

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
was released,

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the court finally agreed

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to solve

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the issue

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
after 20 years.

367
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
However,

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the reason for the confusion

369
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
is that the court

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
has to say more

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
in the next 20 years.

372
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
For example,

373
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
there are psychiatrists

374
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
in psychology schools,

375
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
so at least

376
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
there should be

377
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
some guidelines

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
for the execution.

379
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
However,

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the judge

381
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
has to say more

382
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in the next 20 years.

383
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
For example,

384
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
there are psychiatrists

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
in psychology schools,

386
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
so at least

387
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
there should be

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
some guidelines for the execution.

389
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
However,

390
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the judge

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
has to say more

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
in the next 20 years.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
However,

394
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
there are psychiatrists

This is the second part.

The third part

885
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
is about the

886
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
legal strategies

887
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000

for the execution.

892
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You may think

893
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that you know

894
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the legal context

895
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
but you don't know

896
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
how to operate it.

897
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
However,

898
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
most of the laws

899
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
in Taiwan

900
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
are against the U.S.

901
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and other countries.

902
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
In terms of

903
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the execution

904
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
of the Fourth Claim,

905
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
the progress between Taiwan

906
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and the U.S.

907
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
is not that different.

908
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We just started

909
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
a paper in 2014

910
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and we are still

911
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
working on it.

912
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
At present,

913
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
many U.S. law firms

914
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
will come up with

915
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
creative legal strategies

916
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
based on their lawyers.

917
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
If a particular state

918
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
is successful,

919
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
it may influence

920
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
other states.

921
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
In the end,

922
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
each state will

923
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
have its own

924
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
lawyers

925
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
who will

926
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
determine if

927
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
a particular client

928
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
has a serious mental illness

929
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and how to

930
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
deal with it.

931
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If the client

932
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
has been in the prison

933
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
for more than 10 years

934
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and he looks very sick,

935
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the state government

936
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
will not issue a death warrant.

937
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If the state government

938
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
does not issue a death warrant,

939
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
the defense lawyer

940
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
will have no choice

941
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
but to watch the client

942
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
either go crazy

943
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
or die in the prison

944
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
for other reasons.

945
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The defense lawyer

946
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
will coordinate with

947
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the state government

948
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and if the client

949
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
is very sick,

950
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
the state government

951
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
will issue a death warrant

952
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
for the client.

953
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If the client is in a

954
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
very bad condition

955
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and the state government

956
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
does not issue a death warrant,

957
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the defense lawyer

958
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
will not be able

959
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
to issue a death warrant

960
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
for the client.

961
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The defense lawyer

962
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
will not be able

963
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
to issue a death warrant

964
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
for the client.

965
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Another example

966
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
is from California.

967
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The state government

968
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
will issue a death warrant

969
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
for the client

970
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
if the client

971
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
is in a bad condition

972
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and the state government

973
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
does not issue a death warrant

974
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
for the client.

975
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
The state government

976
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
will issue a death warrant

977
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
for the client

978
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
if the client

979
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
is in a bad condition

980
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and the state government

981
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
does not issue a death warrant

982
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
for the client.

983
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Another example is

984
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
from California.

985
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The state government

986
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
will issue a death warrant

987
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
for the client

988
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
if the client

989
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
is in a bad condition

990
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
and the state government

991
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
does not issue a death warrant

992
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
for the client.

993
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So far,

994
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
the first legal strategy

995
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
has been used a lot

996
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and the probability of success

997
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is relatively high.

998
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's like the tacit understanding

999
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
between the defense team

1000
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and the state government.

1001
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Basically,

1002
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
they will hold a hearing

1003
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
to determine

1004
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
whether the person

1005
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
is mentally ill

1006
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
or not.

1007
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The second strategy

1008
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is the litigation strategy.

1009
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Lastly,

1010
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'd like to thank

1011
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
my collaborators

1012
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and the RAs

1013
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
who helped me

1014
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
code my lawsuit.

1015
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
We're still

1016
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
looking at these

1017
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
long-term death warrant

1018
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and we're still

1019
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
looking at these long-term

1020
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
death warrant

1021
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and the MakeAuthors Foundation

1022
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
has been focusing on

1023
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
the research on mental illness

1024
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and death.

1025
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Is there any possibility of

1026
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
racial inequality?

1027
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's all

1028
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
for my presentation

1029
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and I'd like to see

1030
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
if there are any questions.

1031
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Thank you.

1032
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'll start with Ian.

1033
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Thank you, Ian.

1034
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
This is not my area

1035
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
but I've learned a lot.

1036
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'd like to ask

1037
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
if there are any questions

1038
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
for Ian.

1039
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm happy to ask questions.

1040
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm curious

1041
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and this might not

1042
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
have much to do with

1043
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
your presentation

1044
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
but I'm curious

1045
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
how the US

1046
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
identifies

1047
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
mental illness

1048
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
when it comes

1049
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
to death warrant.

1050
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For example,

1051
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
how much

1052
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
mental illness

1053
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
does this person

1054
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
need?

1055
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
How do they

1056
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
consider this?

1057
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I don't know

1058
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
much about the US.

1059
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
The US court system

1060
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
is not the same as Taiwan.

1061
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They have a national judge

1062
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
for public prosecution.

1063
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm using the term

1064
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
from Taiwan.

1065
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm curious how they

1066
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
consider these things.

1067
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Currently,

1068
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
there are a few

1069
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
institutions

1070
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that have tried to

1071
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
provide guidelines.

1072
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The guidelines are similar

1073
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
to the ones

1074
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
provided by

1075
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
psychiatrists and psychologists.

1076
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
First,

1077
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
each state has different

1078
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
qualifications.

1079
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
There are no rules

1080
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
for each state.

1081
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
For example,

1082
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
how many people

1083
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
can be identified?

1084
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's a mess.

1085
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
For example,

1086
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
there are two psychiatrists

1087
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
in Texas.

1088
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They need to

1089
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
write their own

1090
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
professional report.

1091
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They need to write

1092
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
their diagnosis

1093
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
according to

1094
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DSM-5.

1095
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The rest is left

1096
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
to the judge.

1097
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This is an interesting

1098
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
aspect.

1099
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
There are a lot of judges

1100
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
with serious

1101
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
visual impairments

1102
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and delusions.

1103
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Some people succeed,

1104
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
some people fail.

1105
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I don't know why

1106
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
we need to look at

1107
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
so many factors

1108
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
to determine

1109
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the outcome.

1110
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
In Taiwan,

1111
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
there are no

1112
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
cases like this.

1113
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'd like to ask

1114
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
about mental

1115
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
disorders.

1116
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This is related

1117
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
to the third example,

1118
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
which is about

1119
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
medicine.

1120
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You said it's related to

1121
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
people in prison

1122
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
for a long time.

1123
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm thinking

1124
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that

1125
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
people in prison

1126
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
for a long time

1127
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
are sentenced

1128
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
to death.

1129
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
After a long period

1130
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
of time,

1131
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
it's normal.

1132
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
For example,

1133
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
what's the mechanism

1134
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
for them to

1135
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
apply for

1136
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
this kind of

1137
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
sentence?

1138
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Is it

1139
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
impossible to

1140
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
enforce?

1141
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's rare.

1142
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Most cases

1143
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
require

1144
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
the person to be

1145
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
transferred to

1146
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
a medical institution.

1147
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's rare.

1148
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
The reason is that

1149
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
the death penalty

1150
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
is stricter

1151
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
than the death penalty

1152
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in the United States.

1153
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's not easy

1154
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to get the person out of prison.

1155
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In fact,

1156
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
thousands of people

1157
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
in the United States

1158
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
are waiting for death

1159
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and unable to

1160
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
get help.

1161
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That's why

1162
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the so-called premature

1163
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is used

1164
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
to determine

1165
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
whether the person

1166
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
has the ability

1167
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
to survive

1168
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
for a long time.

1169
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's to

1170
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
determine whether

1171
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
the person

1172
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
has the ability

1173
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
to survive

1174
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
for a long time.

1175
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Most people

1176
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
are in prison.

1177
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Most people

1178
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
are in prison.

1179
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Is prison

1180
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
different from other prisons?

1181
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Is prison different from other prisons?

1182
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It depends on the state.

1183
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Some states have

1184
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
so-called heavy prisons.

1185
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Heavy prisons may have

1186
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
one death cell.

1187
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For example,

1188
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Texas or California

1189
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
may have thousands of people

1190
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
in death cells.

1191
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
They may have

1192
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
all death cells

1193
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
in prison.

1194
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Heavy prisons

1195
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
are more common.

1196
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Some states have

1197
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
fewer death cells.

1198
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
They may be in

1199
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
more independent prisons.

1200
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It depends on the state.

1201
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I think it's interesting.

1202
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I don't know if

1203
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
they are still different.

1204
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Except for

1205
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
all death cells,

1206
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
what about

1207
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
other prisoners?

1208
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
What about other prisoners?

1209
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It depends on the state.

1210
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Some states

1211
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
have

1212
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
heavy prisons.

1213
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Some states have

1214
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
heavy prisons.

1215
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It also depends on the state.

1216
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Some states

1217
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
have more open prisons.

1218
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
They have fewer

1219
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
medical resources.

1220
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Some states have

1221
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
no prisoners.

1222
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Some states have

1223
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
many prisoners.

1224
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Some states have

1225
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
no prisoners.

1226
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
They are waiting for death.

1227
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's not like

1228
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
there are no prisoners.

1229
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
The treatment is different.

1230
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The prison is different.

1231
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The prison is free.

1232
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It has minimum

1233
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
guarantees.

1234
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
They are waiting for death.

1235
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
In theory, they can't use

1236
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
too much resources.

1237
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But there are many people in the US

1238
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and their policies are changing.

1239
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's weird.

1240
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Some people have been

1241
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
in prison for years

1242
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
but they are not dead.

1243
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's awkward.

1244
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's not certain.

1245
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's a complicated

1246
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
situation.

1247
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes.

1248
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Any other questions?

1249
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Any other questions?

1250
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Any other questions?

1251
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Any other questions?

1252
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
No.

1253
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Thank you for the wonderful report.

1254
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm looking forward to

1255
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
your coding.

1256
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I was thinking

1257
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
to do a Lenten class analysis

1258
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
to see

1259
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
whether the prisoners

1260
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
are successful or not.

1261
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Their backgrounds

1262
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and profiles

1263
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
are different.

1264
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm looking forward to

1265
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
your analysis.

1266
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I hope we can

1267
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
finish coding soon.

1268
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Thank you, Annie.

1269
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Thank you, Gao Xian.

1270
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's comfortable

1271
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
to talk about

1272
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
heavy topics.

1273
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I think the topics

1274
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
are sensitive.

1275
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
The ability to save lives

1276
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
is the last

1277
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
decision

1278
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
to be made.

1279
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
It's a complicated decision.

1280
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm glad

1281
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
to have the audience

1282
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
here today.

1283
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Thank you, Annie.

1284
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Thank you, Annie.

1285
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Thank you for the wonderful

1286
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
presentation.

1287
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Thank you for staying up

1288
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
to listen to our

1289
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
presentations.

1290
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Thank you.

1291
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I hope

1292
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Annie,

1293
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
next year

1294
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
you can

1295
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
tell us

1296
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
about your research.

1297
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
OK.

1298
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'll share it

1299
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
with you.

1300
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank you.

1301
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Good night.

1302
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Good morning.

1303
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Good afternoon.

1304
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Thank you.

1305
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Bye-bye.
