1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Both are fine.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you want to introduce again?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's okay, no need.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's start.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I hope the internet is okay later.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If it breaks again, let me know.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is the full screen screen okay now?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, I'll start right away.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thanks to the host, Wei Zhe, for the introduction.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm Pan Haoren from the Department of Chemical Engineering.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The topic of today's report is related to my research.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It is a high-efficiency algorithm for the optimization of P4 alkynes.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Before I start talking about today's topic,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to clarify one thing.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because when you hear the word alkene,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
if you are a material background,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or you may be a chemistry background,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or you are a chemistry background,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
or you are a chemistry background,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you may want to discuss,

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
for example, the problem of alkyne arrangement,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
for example, some morphology,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
for example, I may want to play SRD,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and so on.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But in the field of procedural engineering,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that is, in the field of PSE,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we are referring to any process that can be obtained from the solution.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So today, even if it is just a sedimentary reaction,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
we will also broadly call it crystallization.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Under this definition,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
this crystallization is a process of separation and purification.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It can be done in a continuous way,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
or in a batch way.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
SRD is the so-called supersaturation.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It can be obtained in the following four ways.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What we are discussing today is the crystallization of batches.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Most of the crystallization of batches

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is to make some high-added-value compounds,

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
such as specialized chemicals,

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
such as food additives,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
such as drugs, and so on.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Compared to this continuous way,

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
its operability is relatively large.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It can also deal with some more difficult-to-deal with systems,

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
such as toxic chemicals,

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Such crystallization has two basic mechanisms,

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
which are called nucleation, synthesis, and crystal growth.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nucleation means the new crystal body is generated.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When a new crystal body is generated,

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
its volume is basically less than zero.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Crystal growth means that a new crystal body exists in a batch.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because of the high-added-value compounds,

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
it grows bigger and bigger.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is what we call crystal growth.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Nucleation can be divided into several different mechanisms.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The first one is homogeneous primary nucleation.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It is a spontaneous reaction in thermodynamics.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Nucleation can only occur in a high-added-value system.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The second one is heterogeneous primary nucleation.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is a reaction of different particles.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For example, it may be caused by some pink particles.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The third one is secondary nucleation.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It means that nucleation is generated on the surface of the existing crystal body.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
For example, in a batch, the crystal body may collide with each other.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There will be some friction.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When the friction occurs, its volume is basically less than zero.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is what we call nucleation.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me give you an example.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If there is a batch today,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
there is no crystal body in it at the beginning.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In the early stage of this batch,

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because we want to have the crystal body from nothing,

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it is called primary nucleation.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
However, in the later stage,

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
because there are more crystal bodies,

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
crystal growth and secondary nucleation

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
will become the main mechanism.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In the operation of a batch,

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we can usually add some crystals at the beginning,

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
which are called seed crystals,

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
or simply called seed.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The reason is that these seeds can quickly

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
exhaust the over-homogeneity.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Once it is exhausted,

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
it can inhibit the so-called primary nucleation.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What is the advantage of this?

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The advantage is that primary nucleation has a feature

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
called stochastic,

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
which means that it is random.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So in this operation,

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you can make this process more stable.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Next, let's talk about how to measure the quality of a product.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Of course, we know that the purity of the product

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is a very important indicator.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But in addition to purity,

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
another important indicator is the so-called

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
crystal size distribution, or CSD.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
A good CSD usually has the following features.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
For example, it must be single-seam.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
For example, the ratio of fine particles should be lower.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Next, because in some circumstances,

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
for example, if I want to make a drug today,

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I would like this drug to be in the human body.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The conclusion curve is a curve that we want.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In this case, I may need to specify

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
the average filter of a product

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and the so-called variance of this CSD.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If we can find a way to design a process

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to make the average filter and variance of this product

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
meet such a requirement,

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
it will also be a situation that we want.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course, if today's CSD is not very good,

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it may cause some problems.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For example, if today's product has the so-called double-seam CSD,

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
or its filter distribution,

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
or its fine particles are too high,

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it may cause the following problems,

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
including excessive filter resistance,

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
including the need to use a lot of washing liquid

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to clean the solid,

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or even when it is sent out,

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
these small particles may be directly stuck on the tube wall.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
These are all situations that we don't want to see.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So basically, what we want to do is

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to suppress some excessive nucleation.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Next, if we talk about some

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
CSD control strategies,

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it can be divided into two categories.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The first category is what we call model-free feedback control.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Its idea is that it will use a so-called feedback control loop,

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and some corresponding

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
self-made analytical technology,

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the so-called PAT,

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to implement this.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Basically, such a control strategy,

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just need to know some basic features of the system,

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
for example, what kind of filter is OK.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The so-called model-free model here

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
refers to some kinetic energy of crystal growth and nucleation.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When we use this type of strategy,

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
we don't need to know the kinetic energy of these growth factors.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
One of the so-called model-free strategies

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is called supersaturation control.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Some people call it concentration control.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What it means is that

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
in the entire batch,

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
we control the saturation in a set value.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Of course, it will need some corresponding

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
analytical technology.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For example, like this,

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
it will need an online concentration measurement.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
For example, you can use FTIR to do this.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This strategy is not bad,

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
because we don't need too much information.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But there is a drawback.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We still can't design this product's CSD directly.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because it doesn't have a model to describe.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So in contrast,

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
another method is called model-based control.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It basically uses a function called population density function

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to describe this CSD.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How does this CSD change in the batch?

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We will use a population balance equation

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to describe it.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In this strategy,

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we usually multiply optimization problems

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to find the so-called best control strategy.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The target function may include some

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
batch time,

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
or some characteristics of product CSD statistics.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Decision variable is the so-called

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
control strategy.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
For example, it may be related to the temperature trajectory.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Or I may consider some so-called seed recipes,

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
which is how many seeds I want to add

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and its average filter, and so on.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
One of the challenges of using this model-based control

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is that its burden will be greater.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because the so-called PBE just now

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
belongs to a distributed city,

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so its computational burden is relatively large.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is also one of the purposes of our research.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We hope to use some high-performance computational methods

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to improve the optimization of these P4 solution.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We will analyze several problems,

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
including some competition between target functions, trade-off.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Next, we want to find the seed recipe design

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and some experience rules of control strategy,

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the so-called rule of thumb.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Next, we will also explore

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
if what we use today is the seed coding process,

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what impact will it have on the control of CSD?

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Next, we want to introduce some theories.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
At the beginning, we want to introduce the so-called

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
population density function.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
As mentioned earlier, it is used to describe CSD.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Assuming that there is a system today,

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
we only use the feature length of a system to describe it.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For example, if the solution of this system today

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is close to the sphere,

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
then we can use the diameter or radius

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
as the feature length.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If there is such a description,

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
we put the pdf to l,

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and the result will be

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the solution number in the batch.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Next, we can define a pdf moment.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This moment is not a moment.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It has some other translations in physics,

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but I don't think it fits our situation.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I just call it moment.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I won't translate it.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The definition of moment is as follows.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
From mu0 to mu3,

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
these moments all have corresponding physical meanings.

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The physical meaning of mu3 is the total volume of the solid.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
After we define the pdf,

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
we can write the corresponding population balance equation.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In this study, we have some assumptions,

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
including the theory in the batch,

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
which is uniform,

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and its volume is constant.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We also ignore some phenomena,

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
such as the collision of solids

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and the splitting of solids.

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is called crystal breakage.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Or the collision of solids and solids.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is called aggregation.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's ignore these assumptions.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Next is the volume of the solid.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It has a volume of 0 at the beginning.

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Under these assumptions,

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
we can get a corresponding ppe.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As you can see, it is a Pythagorean equation.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Later, we will talk about

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the physical meaning of the equation

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and some calculations.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If we look at the ppe,

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we can see that it contains

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the momentum of growth and dissolution.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Therefore, we need to introduce the part of momentum.

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
As mentioned earlier,

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the driving force of the crystal is super saturation.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There are many different definitions of super saturation.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Here are the two most common ones,

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the definition of relative and absolute.

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We can see that the definition of super saturation

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is related to the difference between the density of the solution

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and the density of the saturation.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The density of the solution itself

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
can be calculated by mass balance.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's assume that the ppe function

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
is a function of temperature.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Let's assume that

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the ppe function is a function of temperature.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Therefore, the primary nucleation can be ignored.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In this case,

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
we can define the momentum of growth rate and nucleation rate.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
At present, there is no complete theory

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to describe this phenomenon in the academic world.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Therefore, we still use some experimental methods.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What we can notice is that

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the growth rate is divided into two parts.

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The first part is only related to super saturation.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The second part is only related to the size of the crystal.

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If the second part is equal to 1,

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
we call it size-independent growth.

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If the second part is not equal to 1,

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
we call it size-dependent growth.

274
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For most systems,

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
the nucleation rate is more sensitive to super saturation

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
than the growth rate.

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Therefore, the parameter b is greater than g.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Therefore, the parameter b is greater than g.

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Next, I will introduce

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
how to solve the ppe function.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
At the beginning,

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we will divide the ppe function into two parts.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mathematically,

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
we call it homogeneous and non-homogeneous.

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Physically,

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
we call it homogeneous and non-homogeneous.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why do we need to divide it into two parts?

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There are two reasons.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The first reason is that

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
it is more convenient to apply some experimental methods.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The second reason is that

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
we can separate the seed and nucleation

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to make a quantitative description.

294
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
As I just said,

295
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
we want to suppress nucleation.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Therefore, we make a quantitative description

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to make a quantitative description.

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Before we start to talk about

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
some quantitative methods,

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
let's take a look at a simple example.

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
In this example,

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the ppe function has a so-called analysis solution.

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
By the way, let's understand

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the physical meaning of some of the functions.

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's assume that there is a system

306
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
whose growth rate and nucleation rate

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
are constant.

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
In this way,

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
we can write the corresponding ppe

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and the corresponding analysis solution.

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
How can we judge the physical meaning

312
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of the analysis solution?

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If there are some seed crystals,

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the pdf at the beginning

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
looks like an orange.

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
After a while,

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
they will grow bigger.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
How big will they grow?

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The size will increase

320
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the growth rate times batch time.

321
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Therefore,

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the yellow part

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is directly shifted to the right

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
to shift the growth rate times batch time.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In the case of nucleation,

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the size of the seed crystal

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
at the beginning

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
will also be the same

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
as the growth rate times batch time.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Therefore,

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the pdf will look like this.

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Of course,

333
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
this is just a special case.

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's talk about

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
some commonly used quantitative methods.

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
In general,

337
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
there are two types of quantitative methods.

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The first type is called

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the method of moment.

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There are two versions,

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
standard and quadrature.

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
In the standard version,

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
ppe is converted to ODE.

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It can only be used

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
in the size-independent

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
kinetic system.

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In the quadrature version,

348
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
ppe is converted to

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the differential algebraic equation.

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In other words,

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
there is a linear equation

352
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
of the differential equation

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that can only be used

354
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
in the size-independent

355
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
kinetic system.

356
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The advantage of this method

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
is that it can quickly

358
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
solve the moment,

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
but it can't find

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
the complete pdf.

361
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's take a look at

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
the standard version.

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The ODE

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
will look like this.

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
As you can see,

366
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
the seed and nucleation

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
are solved.

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The second method

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
involves

370
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
some linear methods.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There are many

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
methods,

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
including the method of

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
characteristic,

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
method of classes,

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
or the method of

377
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
finite volume.

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The advantage of this method

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
is that it can

380
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
keep the pdf format

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and the pdf format

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
will be based on

383
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the accuracy of

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the CSD analysis

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or the accuracy of

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the numerical method.

387
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It will need a lot of

388
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
discretization points,

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
which will lead to

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
a greater burden

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
on the calculation.

392
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
In this study,

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
we use the NOCH method.

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The idea is that

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the characteristic curve

396
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is represented

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
by the family

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
of ODE.

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
These are some

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
common numerical methods.

401
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'd like to introduce

402
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
a method that

403
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
greatly reduces

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the burden on the calculation.

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's called

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
coordinate transformation.

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This method was

408
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
proposed by two German

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
scholars.

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
As we just saw,

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the fixed value

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
will reduce the burden

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
on the calculation.

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
However,

415
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
since the unit of

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
coordinate transformation

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
is speed,

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
can we use the

419
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
VT graph

420
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that we learned in

421
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
high school

422
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to represent

423
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the area?

424
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The area

425
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
is the size

426
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
of the crystal.

427
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So, we define

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
a transformer time,

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
which is the

430
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
size of the crystal

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
from batch 1

432
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to a certain time.

433
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The transformer time

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
is a unit of

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
length.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We can use

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the VT graph

438
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
to represent

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
the area

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
of the crystal.

441
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The area

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
is the size

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
of the crystal

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
from batch 1

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to a certain time.

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The area

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is the size

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
of the crystal

449
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
from batch 2

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to a certain time.

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We only need to use

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the transformer time

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to represent the

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
area of the crystal.

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This way,

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
we can reduce the

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
burden on the calculation.

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
After introducing

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the necessary theories,

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we can start to look at

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the case studies.

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The first part

463
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
is the competition

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As mentioned earlier,

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the model-based control

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
is to find the best

467
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
control input

468
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
under the

469
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
constraint of

470
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the target function.

471
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There are three types

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
of target function.

473
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The first type is

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
to minimize the

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
new creation moment.

476
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The second type is

477
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
to maximize the

478
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
variable coefficient

479
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
of variation.

480
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Another question is

481
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
how to define

482
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the best strategy.

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is a big question.

484
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There is a study

485
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
conducted by

486
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
my professor

487
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and his team.

488
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The study found

489
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
that the best

490
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
control input

491
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
seems to have a

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
strong relationship

493
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
with the

494
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
target function.

495
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Does this mean

496
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that there is a

497
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
strong competition

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
between the

499
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
target function

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and the

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
control input?

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Finally,

503
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
let's analyze

504
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the relationship

505
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
between the

506
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
target function

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and the

508
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
new creation moment

509
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and the

510
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
variable coefficient.

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
How do we

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
analyze the best

513
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
strategy of

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
multi-target function?

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We use the

516
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
weighting sum method.

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The idea is to

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
write the target function

519
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
as a linear addition

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and the

521
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
weighting vector

522
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
should be specified

523
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
before the

524
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
optimization problem.

525
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
After the specification,

526
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
we can get

527
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the point

528
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
on the

529
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Pareto front.

530
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If α is 0 or 1,

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
we can get

532
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the point on

533
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the Pareto front.

534
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If α is 0 or 1,

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we can get

536
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the point on

537
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the Pareto front.

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How do we choose

539
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the beta?

540
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's find the

541
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
point on the

542
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Pareto front.

543
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Then we define

544
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
the normalized

545
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
objective function.

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The point on the

547
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Pareto front

548
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
should be

549
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
between 0 and 1.

550
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then we can

551
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
define the

552
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
beta.

553
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Another advantage is

554
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
that we can

555
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
find the best

556
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
solution

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
in the

558
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
multiple

559
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Pareto optimal

560
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
solutions.

561
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The shortest

562
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
distance is the

563
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
best solution

564
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
for the

565
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
multiple

566
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Pareto optimal solutions.

567
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The solution is

568
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
called

569
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
knee point.

570
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Now we can

571
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
solve the

572
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
optimization problem.

573
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We need to consider

574
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
independent kinetics.

575
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We also need to

576
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
consider some

577
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
restrictions.

578
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
For example,

579
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
we need to consider

580
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
production rate,

581
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
batch time,

582
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and control input.

583
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The control input

584
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
is set as growth rate.

585
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We can also set it as temperature

586
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
or super saturation.

587
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
They can be

588
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
considered as

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
equal values.

590
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
In this case,

591
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
we can write

592
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the problem

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
formulation,

594
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
as shown in the video.

595
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
For the

596
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
optimization problem,

597
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
the input variable

598
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and the state variable,

599
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the growth rate and the

600
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
nucleation moment,

601
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
are all time functions.

602
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This is the

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
dynamic optimization problem.

604
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There are many ways

605
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to solve the DLP problem.

606
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
In today's

607
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
study,

608
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
we use

609
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the optimal control theory.

610
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The optimal control theory

611
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
can be

612
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
introduced by

613
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Pond-Stratton's

614
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Minimum Principle.

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This principle

616
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
is a two-point

617
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
boundary-variable problem.

618
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It is a two-point

619
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
boundary-variable problem.

620
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It is a two-point

621
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
boundary-variable problem.

622
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It sounds good.

623
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It can be introduced

624
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
as a necessary condition.

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But it is challenging.

626
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
First,

627
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I just need to write

628
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the TP-BVP,

629
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
which is challenging.

630
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The TP-BVP

631
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
is a two-point

632
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
boundary-variable problem.

633
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We know that

634
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
there may be

635
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
some convergence problems

636
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in the numerical method.

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
In today's study,

638
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
we just need to

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
use the coding

640
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
transformation

641
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and some assumptions.

642
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Then,

643
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
we can

644
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
apply the TP-BVP

645
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and TPs

646
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
to solve

647
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the problem.

648
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The TP-BVP

649
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
is a two-point

650
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
boundary-variable problem.

651
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It is a two-point

652
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
boundary-variable problem.

653
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We can use the

654
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
TP-BVP

655
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and TPs

656
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
to solve

657
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
the problem.

658
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The TP-BVP

659
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
is a two-point

660
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
boundary-variable problem.

661
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We can use the TP-BVP

662
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and TPs

663
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
to solve

664
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the problem.

665
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The TP-BVP

666
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
is a two-point

667
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
boundary-variable problem.

668
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We can use the TP-BVP

669
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and TPs

670
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to solve

671
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the problem.

672
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The TP-BVP

673
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
is a two-point

674
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
boundary-variable problem.

675
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We can use the TP-BVP

676
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and TPs

677
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to solve

678
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the problem.

679
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The TP-BVP

680
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
is a two-point

681
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
boundary-variable problem.

682
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We can use the TP-BVP

683
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and TPs

684
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
to solve

685
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the problem.

686
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Remember that

687
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
for any value

688
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
in the U-star,

689
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the u-star

690
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
must have

691
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
a minimum value

692
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
for the Hamiltonian.

693
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In this section,

694
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
the state variable

695
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
is selected as

696
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
the movement

697
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
at increased process time.

698
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The control input

699
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
is the growth rate.

700
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The reason for this

701
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
is to make it easier

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to push down the equation.

703
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The simplification

704
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we mentioned earlier

705
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is assuming that

706
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the nucleation rate

707
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
is no longer affected

708
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
by the nucleation crystal.

709
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This is a reasonable assumption

710
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
because the size of the seed

711
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
should be greater than

712
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
the size of the nucleation.

713
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Because of this simplification,

714
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it is possible to

715
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
calculate the growth rate

716
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in the same way.

717
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The process is relatively long,

718
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
so I won't go into details.

719
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can read the paper

720
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I published

721
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
for more details.

722
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's take a look at

723
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
some case studies.

724
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
In this chapter,

725
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
we used two different systems.

726
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
One is the nucleation crystal.

727
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The other is the

728
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
pericyclic crystal.

729
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Their

730
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
kinetic parameters

731
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
are as shown.

732
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Note that

733
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
J refers to

734
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
the relation between

735
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the nucleation rate

736
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and mu3,

737
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
which is the number

738
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
of crystals in the batch.

739
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The nucleation rate

740
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
is proportional to mu3,

741
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
but the nucleation rate

742
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
is not related to mu3.

743
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This will lead to some

744
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
differences in the nucleation rate.

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I will talk about this later.

746
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
In addition to the nucleation rate,

747
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we will also look at

748
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
some simple control trajectories

749
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
that will lead to

750
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
a control result.

751
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
We used a system that

752
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
included linear deceleration,

753
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
three-dimensional deceleration,

754
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and the pericyclic crystal

755
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
we mentioned earlier.

756
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This system is called

757
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
size-independent kinetics.

758
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
For the pericyclic crystal control trajectory,

759
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
the growth rate is measured

760
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
as a fixed value.

761
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The result of these trajectories

762
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is as shown in the picture.

763
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Let's look at

764
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the pericyclic crystal system.

765
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If it is a linear deceleration,

766
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it will lead to

767
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
early growth trajectory,

768
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
which means that

769
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the growth rate will be higher

770
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
due to the

771
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
nucleation rate.

772
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The early growth

773
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
of the pericyclic crystal

774
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
will cause

775
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
the growth rate to increase.

776
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This will lead to

777
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
a larger

778
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
nucleation rate.

779
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
On the other hand,

780
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
a tubid cooling

781
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
can be considered a net growth

782
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because it has a large growth rate

783
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
later on,

784
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
which will lead to a

785
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
larger nucleation rate.

786
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
If we look at the

787
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
PENTA system,

788
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
we will see a similar phenomenon.

789
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It is worth mentioning that

790
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
if we look at the temperature

791
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
trajectory,

792
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
we will find that the temperature

793
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
after the linear cooling

794
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
is relatively low.

795
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The reason is that

796
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
a lot of the solution

797
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
will be sucked out

798
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
from the system.

799
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
This will cause

800
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the batch temperature

801
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to be relatively low.

802
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Next,

803
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
if we look at

804
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the target function

805
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
set,

806
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
we will

807
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
divide the target function

808
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
into two categories.

809
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The first category is the lower moment.

810
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It is composed of mu0 to mu2.

811
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The higher moment

812
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
is composed of mu3 to mu5.

813
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
In this case,

814
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
we can divide the target function

815
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
into groups

816
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and use

817
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
different pairs

818
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to analyze.

819
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can see

820
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that we have analyzed four groups of target functions.

821
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The first two groups

822
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
are a higher moment

823
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and a lower moment.

824
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The last two groups

825
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
are two higher moments

826
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and two lower moments.

827
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Let's take a look at

828
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
how the different target functions

829
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
are related to each other.

830
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
If we look at

831
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
the small triangle system,

832
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
we can draw

833
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
all four groups.

834
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We will find that

835
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the first two groups,

836
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
which are a higher moment

837
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and a lower moment,

838
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
will cause a strong

839
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
trade-off.

840
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This can be seen from the

841
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
width of the x-axis.

842
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The x-axis represents

843
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
the volume of mu3n.

844
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The first group

845
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
is about

846
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
5000 to 7000,

847
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
which is about 40%.

848
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The second group is about

849
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
50,000 to 10,000,

850
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
which is almost double.

851
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The trade-off between

852
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
3.3 and 3.4

853
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
is relatively weak.

854
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
If we look at

855
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
the yellow circle,

856
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
it represents

857
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
the target function

858
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
obtained by super-saturation control.

859
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The value of this target function

860
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
is quite close

861
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
to the so-called need point.

862
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So we can conclude that

863
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
super-saturation control

864
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
seems to get

865
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
a trade-off result.

866
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If we look at

867
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the Penta system,

868
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the trade-off

869
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
is quite similar to

870
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
the super-saturation system.

871
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What we need to pay attention to

872
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
is the 3.1 graph.

873
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The yellow circle

874
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
obtained by super-saturation control

875
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
is directly

876
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
overlapped with the need point.

877
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Why?

878
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Because in the Penta system,

879
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the nucleation rate and

880
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
the density of the

881
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
mu3 or batch

882
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
are not related.

883
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
This means that

884
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't need to

885
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
change the value of

886
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
super-saturation control

887
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
before or after the batch.

888
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I only need to make

889
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the nucleation number

890
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the lowest value.

891
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If we look at

892
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the growth rate trajectory,

893
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
let's look at

894
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the single objective

895
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
of the Penta system.

896
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
We will find that

897
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
the early growth trajectory

898
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
seems to be

899
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
more friendly to

900
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the lower moment

901
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
objective.

902
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The reason is that

903
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
early growth can avoid

904
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
the nucleation rate

905
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to become very large

906
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
if the nucleation rate

907
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
is small.

908
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
On the other hand,

909
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
if the nucleation rate

910
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
is small,

911
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
the nucleation rate

912
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
in the later stage

913
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
will not grow

914
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
much.

915
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This will make

916
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
the nucleation rate

917
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
smaller,

918
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
so it will be more

919
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
friendly to the higher

920
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
objectives.

921
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
If we look at the

922
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
so-called knee point

923
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
trajectory,

924
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
we will find that

925
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
the growth rate

926
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
of 3.1 and 3.2

927
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
is relatively small.

928
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This can be verified

929
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that super-saturation control

930
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
has a good balance

931
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
between the higher moment

932
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and lower moment

933
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
objectives.

934
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
If we look at the

935
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
3.3 and 3.4,

936
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
we will find that

937
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
3.3 has two higher

938
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
moment objectives,

939
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
so its trajectory

940
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
is more friendly

941
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
to the later growth.

942
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
On the other hand,

943
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
3.4 has two lower

944
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
moment objectives,

945
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
so its knee point

946
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
trajectory is more

947
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
friendly to the early growth.

948
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We can conclude that

949
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
super-saturation control

950
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
can be used

951
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
as a rule of thumb

952
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
in the

953
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Penta system.

954
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
In conclusion,

955
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
we use

956
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the best control

957
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
theory

958
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
to solve

959
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
these problems

960
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
in a

961
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
self-explanatory

962
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
way.

963
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We also analyzed

964
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the tradeoff

965
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and found that

966
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
the higher moment

967
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and lower moment

968
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
objectives are more competitive.

969
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It seems that

970
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
super-saturation control

971
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
is a pretty good

972
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
strategy in these two systems.

973
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
However,

974
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
the SSC

975
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
super-saturation control

976
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
is also a good idea.

977
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
However,

978
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
we still need to

979
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
explore other systems.

980
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
When we were

981
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
looking for this document,

982
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
we found that

983
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the numerical range

984
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
of the K-parameter

985
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is very wide,

986
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and it can be as wide as

987
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
a dozen orders.

988
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
In addition,

989
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the unit of

990
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the K-parameter

991
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
is related to

992
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the unit of

993
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
the J-parameter.

994
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Another problem is that

995
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
we can't judge

996
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
the numerical range

997
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
of the system

998
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
directly from the value.

999
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Another problem

1000
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
is that

1001
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
we also want to explore

1002
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the design of the C-recipe.

1003
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A group of Japanese scholars

1004
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
did an experiment

1005
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
to explore

1006
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
several different crystalline systems.

1007
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
They found that

1008
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
as long as the C-loading ratio

1009
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
is increased,

1010
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
the definition of C-loading ratio

1011
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is a ratio of

1012
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
C and product mass.

1013
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
As long as the C-loading ratio

1014
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is increased,

1015
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and the C-mean size is reduced,

1016
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
the numerical range

1017
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
can be as limited as possible.

1018
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There are two problems here.

1019
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
First, we know that

1020
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
if the C-loading ratio

1021
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
is higher,

1022
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and the C-mean size is

1023
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
smaller,

1024
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
then the average

1025
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
numerical range of the product

1026
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
will also be smaller.

1027
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Of course, the goals mentioned earlier

1028
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
are contrary.

1029
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Next, if the C-loading ratio

1030
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
is too high,

1031
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
or if C is used too aggressively,

1032
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
then the product recycle rate

1033
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
will be higher.

1034
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
This is not a good phenomenon.

1035
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
In order to analyze

1036
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
these problems,

1037
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
we will use

1038
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
a soundless model

1039
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
to quickly analyze

1040
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
these problems.

1041
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Let me briefly introduce

1042
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
this soundless model.

1043
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
First, in order to reduce

1044
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
the number of parameters,

1045
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
we combine

1046
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
these parameters.

1047
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
After combining,

1048
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
the definition of Kb

1049
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
is different.

1050
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The definition of Gamma

1051
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
is the relative sensitivity

1052
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
of the nucleation rate

1053
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and growth rate

1054
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
to the saturation rate.

1055
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Next, we define

1056
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the reference quantity

1057
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
with the underline ref.

1058
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A prime means

1059
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
that this quantity

1060
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
is a soundless quantity.

1061
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
For example,

1062
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I want to define a soundless growth rate,

1063
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
which is the original value

1064
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
divided by the reference quantity.

1065
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Based on the following definition,

1066
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
we can build

1067
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
this soundless model.

1068
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
In this model,

1069
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the soundless C-mass

1070
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
will be the C-loading ratio.

1071
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
In this way,

1072
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
it is easier to see

1073
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
how large the ratio is.

1074
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
In terms of the

1075
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
selection of the target function,

1076
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
we just mentioned

1077
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the competition between

1078
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
the higher-moment and lower-moment

1079
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
target function,

1080
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
so we choose one

1081
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
as a representative.

1082
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
We choose the volume of nucleation

1083
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and the number of nucleation

1084
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
as the higher-moment and lower-moment

1085
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
representative.

1086
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We can also write the target function

1087
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
as a linear addition.

1088
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We use the same method

1089
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
to solve this addition problem.

1090
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The process is similar,

1091
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so I won't go into details.

1092
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
As for the city recipe,

1093
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
we know that

1094
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
there should be an infinite number

1095
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
of city recipes

1096
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
that can balance the nucleation.

1097
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We define the so-called

1098
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
critical city recipe.

1099
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It is a combination of

1100
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
C-loading ratio and

1101
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
C-means size.

1102
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
For example,

1103
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the nucleated volume

1104
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
at the knee point

1105
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
is equal to

1106
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
1% of the city volume.

1107
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
We consider 1%

1108
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to be negligible,

1109
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
so we can use

1110
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
C-loading ratio

1111
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to balance

1112
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the nucleation.

1113
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Next,

1114
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
let's look at

1115
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
the

1116
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
kinetic parameter.

1117
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
In our research,

1118
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
we found 32 sets of

1119
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
different crystallization systems.

1120
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We can see the relative

1121
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
parameter gamma

1122
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and J.

1123
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
In most systems,

1124
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
gamma is between 1 and 2.5,

1125
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
while J is between 0 and 1.

1126
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You can refer to

1127
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
this paper

1128
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
by me as

1129
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the first author

1130
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
of the paper.

1131
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We consider the

1132
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
solution of the crystallization system,

1133
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
including many organic compounds,

1134
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
non-organic compounds,

1135
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
food additives,

1136
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and medicines.

1137
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You can refer to

1138
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
these details in the paper.

1139
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
In this case,

1140
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
we can solve

1141
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the relative parietal front.

1142
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
We find that

1143
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
when the value of gamma

1144
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is higher than

1145
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
the value of J,

1146
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the relative parietal front

1147
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
will be wider.

1148
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
On the other hand,

1149
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
if the nucleation rate

1150
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and growth rate

1151
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
are similar to

1152
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the sensitivity of

1153
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
super-saturation,

1154
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
gamma will be closer to 1,

1155
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and the relative parietal front

1156
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
will be weaker.

1157
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
At the same time,

1158
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the difference between

1159
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
super-saturation and

1160
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
nucleation rate

1161
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
will be greater.

1162
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
In other cases,

1163
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
the difference will be smaller.

1164
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
The reason is that

1165
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
when J is between 0 and 1,

1166
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
the super-saturation will

1167
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
be minimized by

1168
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
mu0n,

1169
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
which is the maximum

1170
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
reduction of nucleation rate.

1171
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
In other cases,

1172
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
if gamma is not large,

1173
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the relative parietal front

1174
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
will not be wide,

1175
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and the result of

1176
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
nucleation rate

1177
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and super-saturation

1178
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
will not be much different.

1179
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is another proof

1180
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
that super-saturation

1181
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
is a good control strategy

1182
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
for most systems.

1183
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
As for the series of design,

1184
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
we will discuss

1185
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
the impact of batch time

1186
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
on the series of recipes.

1187
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The longer the batch time,

1188
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
the smaller the

1189
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
average super-saturation

1190
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and nucleation rate.

1191
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
In this case,

1192
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
we don't need to add so much seed.

1193
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
However,

1194
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
is it worth it?

1195
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Because the longer the batch time,

1196
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
it is not a good thing.

1197
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Is there a CP value

1198
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
to extend the batch time

1199
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
to reduce the

1200
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
amount of seed?

1201
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Is there a general rule

1202
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
for different

1203
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
systems?

1204
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Or is there a general rule?

1205
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We would like to

1206
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
do an analysis

1207
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
through this

1208
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
random framework.

1209
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The result is

1210
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
the extended batch time

1211
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
affects the

1212
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
seed loading ratio,

1213
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
depending on

1214
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
the system.

1215
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
For example,

1216
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
if I change the batch time

1217
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
from 1 hour to 12 hours,

1218
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the amount of seed

1219
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
changes from

1220
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
100% to

1221
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
20%.

1222
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
However,

1223
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
for system 3,

1224
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the extended batch time

1225
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
basically has no effect.

1226
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
This is called

1227
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
system specific.

1228
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
In this chapter,

1229
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
we have analyzed

1230
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
seed recipe design

1231
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and

1232
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
seed loading ratio.

1233
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We will

1234
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
use

1235
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
a high-efficiency

1236
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
random framework

1237
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
to analyze

1238
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
the best solution

1239
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
by

1240
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
using

1241
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
a high-efficiency

1242
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
random framework.

1243
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
In the last part,

1244
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
we consider

1245
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
the donor stage.

1246
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
In some documents,

1247
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
it is mentioned that

1248
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
if we include

1249
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
the dissolution mechanism

1250
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
into the operation,

1251
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
we will have the opportunity

1252
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
to control the

1253
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
seed SSD

1254
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
However,

1255
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
if we use

1256
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the model-based method,

1257
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
we will have to

1258
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
analyze the crystal

1259
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
disappearance.

1260
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
In the process of

1261
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
dissolution,

1262
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
some crystals will

1263
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
disappear.

1264
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
In the past,

1265
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
the model-based description

1266
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
was described in

1267
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
a rational way,

1268
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
but in this chapter,

1269
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
we want to solve this problem.

1270
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Since we want to

1271
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
analyze the dissolution,

1272
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
we have to analyze

1273
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the PPE.

1274
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Let's assume

1275
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
there are many stages in the batch.

1276
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
In each stage,

1277
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
only growth

1278
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
or dissolution occurs.

1279
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
In addition,

1280
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
this process always starts

1281
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
with the dissolution.

1282
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In this way,

1283
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
we can write the

1284
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
number of growth stage

1285
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and dissolution stage,

1286
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and write the PPE.

1287
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The lower case k

1288
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
is the stage number.

1289
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
At the same time,

1290
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
the kinetic expression

1291
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and the definition of

1292
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
transform time

1293
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
are based on

1294
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
the growth stage expression

1295
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and the definition of

1296
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
transform time expression.

1297
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
In this way,

1298
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
we can see that

1299
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
the expression and

1300
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
definition of transform time

1301
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
are similar.

1302
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Let's divide the

1303
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
PPE into

1304
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
seed and nucleation part.

1305
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
In the seed part,

1306
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
we can solve

1307
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the expletive solution

1308
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
in the tau domain.

1309
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
We can see that

1310
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
the expletive solution

1311
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
can be expressed

1312
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
in the tau domain

1313
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
regardless of

1314
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
growth stage

1315
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
or dissolution stage.

1316
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Again,

1317
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
we use a

1318
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
high-performance method

1319
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to solve the seed PPE.

1320
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The nucleation part

1321
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
is a bit more complicated

1322
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
because it involves

1323
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
the size-independent

1324
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
growth and dissolution

1325
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
kinetics.

1326
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The reason for this

1327
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
is that

1328
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
if we want to

1329
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
use the

1330
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
standard method

1331
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
of moment

1332
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
to solve the PPE,

1333
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
this is a necessary

1334
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
assumption.

1335
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
At the same time,

1336
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it is a reasonable assumption

1337
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
because the value of

1338
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
GL and DL

1339
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
are close to 1

1340
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
when L is small.

1341
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
When we

1342
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
do the experiment

1343
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
to fit the parameter,

1344
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
most of the parameters

1345
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
are used in the

1346
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
seed-goron crystal experiment.

1347
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
There is no evidence

1348
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
to show that

1349
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
small nucleated crystals

1350
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
have the same kinetic behavior.

1351
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So we make the above assumption.

1352
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Under this assumption,

1353
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
we can write the

1354
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
corresponding PPE.

1355
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
As you can see,

1356
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
it is a continuous solution.

1357
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
What is the benefit of this?

1358
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
This can lead us to

1359
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
directly use

1360
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
the standard method of moment

1361
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
to match the continuous expression

1362
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
to deduce

1363
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
the corresponding ODE.

1364
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
What is the role of

1365
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
the continuous expression?

1366
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Let's look at this graph.

1367
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Suppose we have a batch

1368
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
with only two stages.

1369
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
After the first stage is over,

1370
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
the nucleated

1371
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
CSD

1372
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
looks like this.

1373
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
The second stage

1374
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
will move all the CSD

1375
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
to the left

1376
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
when it is about to

1377
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
dissolve.

1378
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Once the crystal size

1379
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
is reduced,

1380
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the continuous expression

1381
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
can be used

1382
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
as a reference

1383
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
for the

1384
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
disappearing crystal rate.

1385
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
After discussing

1386
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
some mathematical methods

1387
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and theories,

1388
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
we can look at

1389
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
the so-called

1390
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
attenuable seed-goron CSD.

1391
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Why do we want to

1392
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
find the CSD

1393
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The main idea is

1394
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
that when we

1395
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
select the crystal

1396
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
or select the product,

1397
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
we often use the

1398
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
sieve to select the product.

1399
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
In this way,

1400
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
the average grain diameter of the product

1401
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and the width of the CSD

1402
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
will be limited by the

1403
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
size of the sieve.

1404
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So if we can

1405
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
design a process

1406
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
to control the grain

1407
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
diameter and

1408
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
the width of the CSD,

1409
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
it will be the best.

1410
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So we can use

1411
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
the algorithm

1412
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
we just introduced

1413
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
to do a quick analysis.

1414
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
In this chapter,

1415
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
we use a

1416
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
simple system.

1417
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
The simple system of kinetic

1418
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
is shown below.

1419
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
The next question is

1420
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
how do we define

1421
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the so-called

1422
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
attenuable region.

1423
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We use the

1424
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
mean and

1425
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
variance of the product

1426
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
to define it.

1427
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
We define the

1428
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
seed CSD

1429
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and some constraints

1430
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
for optimization.

1431
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The constraints include

1432
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
initial condition,

1433
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
seed loading,

1434
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
solubility,

1435
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and production rate.

1436
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Some more detailed

1437
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
explanations can be found

1438
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
in another paper

1439
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
by me.

1440
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I won't go into

1441
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
too much detail here.

1442
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Next,

1443
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
the constraints

1444
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
for the product

1445
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
mu0 and mu3

1446
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
can be defined

1447
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
by the

1448
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
mean and

1449
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
variance of the product

1450
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
mu0 and mu3.

1451
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Finally,

1452
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
when we define

1453
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
the attenuable region,

1454
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
we use the mean size

1455
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to define the

1456
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
number volume mean.

1457
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
We can then

1458
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
use the constraints

1459
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
we just mentioned

1460
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and

1461
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
the number volume mean

1462
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
of the target

1463
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
to maximize or minimize

1464
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
the product's sigma p

1465
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
or variance.

1466
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
In this way,

1467
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
we can define the

1468
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
attenuable region.

1469
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Note that

1470
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
we only talked about the seed.

1471
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
The PBE of the seed

1472
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
can be expressed by tau.

1473
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Therefore,

1474
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
we can see that

1475
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
we haven't mentioned

1476
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
the sum of saturation

1477
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of the seed.

1478
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This is the result.

1479
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
First, let's look at

1480
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
the attenuable region.

1481
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
As a result,

1482
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
if this is a single-stage process,

1483
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
we will get an attenuable curve

1484
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
instead of a region.

1485
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
However,

1486
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
if we have more stages,

1487
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
the region will become wider.

1488
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
However,

1489
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
the width of the region

1490
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
is basically

1491
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
the same as

1492
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
the width of the seed.

1493
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Therefore,

1494
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
the CSD of

1495
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
A, B, C

1496
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
will become

1497
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
wider and wider.

1498
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
However,

1499
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
the CSD of

1500
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
D, E, F, G

1501
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
will not change much.

1502
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Why is that?

1503
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Let's find out.

1504
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The result is

1505
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
that the growth rate

1506
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and the dissolution rate

1507
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
have different sensitivities

1508
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
to the crystal size.

1509
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The growth rate

1510
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
is more sensitive

1511
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
while the dissolution rate

1512
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
is only sensitive

1513
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
in a small range.

1514
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Therefore,

1515
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
if I want to make the CSD

1516
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
narrower,

1517
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I can only do cycling

1518
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
in a narrow region.

1519
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
At the same time,

1520
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the mu3 change

1521
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
in the growth stage

1522
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
is relatively small.

1523
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Now,

1524
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
let's talk about

1525
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
the attenuable region.

1526
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
If we have

1527
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
the product

1528
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
mean size

1529
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and sigma p,

1530
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
and the value

1531
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
is in the attenuable region,

1532
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
we can use

1533
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
the optimization problem

1534
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
to find out

1535
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
a set of CDO and

1536
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
a set of TAUF.

1537
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
There are many sets of solutions.

1538
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
The patch time

1539
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and the nucleated volume

1540
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
of each set

1541
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
are different.

1542
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
However, the patch time

1543
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and the nucleated volume

1544
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
will depend on

1545
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
the sequence of

1546
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
the second function

1547
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and the constant function.

1548
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
We can use

1549
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
the optimization problem

1550
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
to find out

1551
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the minimum patch time

1552
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
under the conditions

1553
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
of the product mean

1554
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and variance.

1555
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
This is a trade-off.

1556
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The larger the set point

1557
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
of the super-saturation,

1558
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
the shorter the patch time.

1559
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
However, the same nucleation rate

1560
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
will be larger.

1561
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So, we draw

1562
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
a curve

1563
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
to analyze

1564
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
the relationship.

1565
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
At the same time,

1566
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
we can deduce

1567
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
the corresponding temperature.

1568
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Then, we can analyze

1569
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
how large the set point

1570
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
of the super-saturation

1571
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
will be.

1572
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
In this chapter,

1573
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
we used the framework

1574
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
to analyze

1575
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
the C-CSD tailoring problem

1576
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
using

1577
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
gross dissolution cycles.

1578
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We can also

1579
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
analyze the so-called

1580
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
crystal disappearance.

1581
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
As for

1582
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
the expandability

1583
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
of the attainable region,

1584
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
it will be determined

1585
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
by the kinetic.

1586
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
We also discussed

1587
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the competitive relationship

1588
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
between patch time

1589
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and inhibiting nucleation.

1590
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The conclusion of

1591
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
the last chapter

1592
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
is that

1593
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
we analyzed the following

1594
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
problems

1595
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
using

1596
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
coordinate transformation,

1597
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
optimum control theory,

1598
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
target number trade-off analysis,

1599
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
rule-of-sum

1600
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
control strategy,

1601
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
C0-0 ratio

1602
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
saving problem,

1603
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and attainable region

1604
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
problem.

1605
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
This kind of framework

1606
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
can be used in

1607
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
different fields.

1608
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
These are some research directions

1609
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
for the future,

1610
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
including the analysis

1611
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
of more complex

1612
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
parameters,

1613
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
including

1614
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
crystal shape process,

1615
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and temperature dependent

1616
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
systems.

1617
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
We can also consider

1618
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
the control of

1619
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
model-based

1620
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
control.

1621
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
There are some

1622
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
parameter uncertainty problems,

1623
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
so we need

1624
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
robustness analysis.

1625
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We can also

1626
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
use optimum

1627
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
control theory

1628
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
in some advanced

1629
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
control strategies,

1630
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
such as

1631
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
model predictive control.

1632
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
This kind of

1633
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
control strategy

1634
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
requires higher

1635
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
computational efficiency.

1636
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
This is the

1637
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
end of

1638
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
today's lecture.

1639
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Thank you for

1640
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
listening to my

1641
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
presentation.

1642
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
If you have any questions,

1643
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
please feel free to ask.

1644
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Can you hear me?

1645
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yes, we can.

1646
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
This is a very

1647
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
informative talk.

1648
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I have a

1649
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
quick question.

1650
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You said robust analysis

1651
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
is basically

1652
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
like error analysis.

1653
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Let's say

1654
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
there is a certain

1655
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
uncertainty in the

1656
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
kinetic parameter.

1657
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You can only give

1658
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
a rough estimate.

1659
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
If there is

1660
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
such an uncertainty,

1661
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
how much difference

1662
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
will it make

1663
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
if you run

1664
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
it again?

1665
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Is that what you mean?

1666
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yes.

1667
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I am just

1668
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
curious

1669
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
if this is

1670
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
what you want to do

1671
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
in the future.

1672
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I am curious

1673
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
about the

1674
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
kinetic parameter.

1675
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You are right.

1676
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I can understand.

1677
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I am a scientist.

1678
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It is difficult

1679
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
to get a precise

1680
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
kinetic parameter.

1681
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So I just want to know

1682
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
what is the error.

1683
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
According to

1684
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
the best

1685
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
data set

1686
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
in the future.

1687
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
If

1688
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
there is such an

1689
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
error,

1690
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
how much difference

1691
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
will it make

1692
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
if you run

1693
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
it again?

1694
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Will it cause

1695
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
serious consequences?

1696
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
If there is

1697
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
a certain error,

1698
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
we know

1699
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
that the model

1700
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
will be different.

1701
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I just want to know

1702
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
your comment on this.

1703
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
First of all,

1704
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
this is the

1705
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
future research direction.

1706
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
We are still

1707
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
doing some early

1708
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
studies.

1709
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Indeed,

1710
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
in the robust

1711
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
control

1712
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
or error analysis,

1713
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
there is a lot of research.

1714
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Will it cause

1715
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
disastrous consequences?

1716
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It may not.

1717
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It is because

1718
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
the crystallization

1719
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
process is quite long.

1720
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Of course, it may cause

1721
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
some troubles

1722
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
in post-processing.

1723
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Therefore,

1724
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
some batch-to-batch

1725
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
variations

1726
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
or some

1727
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
up-and-down errors

1728
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
need to be studied.

1729
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
As for the

1730
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
systems we just mentioned,

1731
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
we are currently

1732
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
using other people's

1733
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
experimental parameters

1734
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
to do the so-called

1735
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
unknown case analysis.

1736
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
At present, we are

1737
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
focusing on

1738
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
some so-called

1739
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
goal-tradeoff

1740
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
algorithms.

1741
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We haven't

1742
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
done this kind of

1743
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
research in other

1744
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
groups.

1745
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I see.

1746
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Since you are discussing

1747
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
the crystallization process,

1748
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
assuming that

1749
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
there are some errors in

1750
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
the kinetic parameters,

1751
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
but the result is still

1752
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
optimized,

1753
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
it is

1754
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
quite reasonable.

1755
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Indeed,

1756
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
we may consider

1757
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
some so-called nominal values

1758
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and some so-called robust values.

1759
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
For example,

1760
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
under some

1761
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
kinetic errors,

1762
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
what is the

1763
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
variation of the result?

1764
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I see.

1765
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Have you ever done

1766
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
any experiments

1767
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
with the crystallization

1768
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
process?

1769
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
For example,

1770
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
have you ever

1771
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
compared some

1772
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
experimental data

1773
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
with the result of

1774
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
profiling?

1775
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
To be honest,

1776
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I haven't.

1777
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Frankly speaking,

1778
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
we are

1779
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
optimizing

1780
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and calculating

1781
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
the result.

1782
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Thank you.

1783
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Thank you.

1784
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Any other questions?

1785
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
OK.

1786
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I have the most questions.

1787
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I have a question.

1788
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
But I am not sure

1789
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
if I have mentioned it.

1790
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You mentioned

1791
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
the multi-target

1792
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
PBE.

1793
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I forgot which page.

1794
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You mentioned Alpha, Beta,

1795
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Beta 1 and Beta 2.

1796
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
You mentioned

1797
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
how to

1798
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
look at Beta 1 and Beta 2.

1799
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Right.

1800
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
When you

1801
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
introduced the function,

1802
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I was curious

1803
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
how you

1804
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
decide the

1805
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
weight.

1806
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It seems that

1807
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
you have

1808
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
linked

1809
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Phi 1 and Phi 2.

1810
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Have you considered

1811
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
linking more?

1812
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Or

1813
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
do you use

1814
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
this expression?

1815
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Phi 1 and Phi 2.

1816
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Alpha 1

1817
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
will be

1818
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
considered as

1819
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Phi 1.

1820
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Alpha between 0 and 1

1821
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
will be

1822
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Phi 1 and Phi 2,

1823
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
any weight.

1824
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
As long as

1825
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Alpha between 0 and 1

1826
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
can be

1827
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
analyzed.

1828
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Sorry.

1829
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
You may have interrupted.

1830
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You can

1831
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
continue.

1832
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
OK.

1833
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Alpha between 0 and 1

1834
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
will be considered as

1835
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Phi 1 or Phi 2.

1836
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
As long as

1837
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Alpha between 0 and 1

1838
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
can be considered as

1839
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Phi 1 or Phi 2,

1840
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
any weight.

1841
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Right.

1842
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
How do you know

1843
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
which one is better?

1844
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
If Alpha is bigger,

1845
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Phi 1 is more important.

1846
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
If Alpha is smaller,

1847
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Phi 2 is more important.

1848
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
How do you know

1849
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
which one is more important?

1850
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
OK.

1851
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Because

1852
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
the first question is

1853
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
it's hard to say.

1854
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
For example, Phi 1 is twice as important as Phi 2.

1855
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It's hard to define.

1856
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So the idea is

1857
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
we do a

1858
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
so-called normalization

1859
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
on page 22.

1860
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
We compress Phi 1 and Phi 2

1861
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
to be between 0 and 1.

1862
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Like this picture on the right.

1863
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
These two points,

1864
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
these two points correspond to

1865
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
the best solution of Phi 1 and Phi 2.

1866
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
After normalization,

1867
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
it corresponds to

1868
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
the two points

1869
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
0 and 1.

1870
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So on such a plane,

1871
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
the original point is

1872
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
the best solution

1873
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
of two goal functions at the same time.

1874
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But due to competition,

1875
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
this is not possible.

1876
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So we want to

1877
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
draw the cradle front first.

1878
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Then we find a point

1879
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
that is the shortest distance

1880
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
between this point and the original point.

1881
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It means that

1882
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
the value of this point

1883
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
in Phi 1 and Phi 2

1884
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
and the percentage difference

1885
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
between them

1886
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
is the smallest.

1887
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And this point is

1888
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
the best trade-off.

1889
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
There is a

1890
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
name in the multi-goal function

1891
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
called knee point.

1892
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It can be used to describe such a point.

1893
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Basically, it is done

1894
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
in this way.

1895
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I see.

1896
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
What I just saw is

1897
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
how to say

1898
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
when you minimize

1899
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the distance from the original point,

1900
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
my intuition is that

1901
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
in terms of math,

1902
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
that point also means

1903
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
that the plus solution

1904
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
you are looking for

1905
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
should be minimized.

1906
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Or is it not necessary?

1907
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I'm just curious

1908
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
if there is a link between them.

1909
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I should say

1910
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
that there is a

1911
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
so-called double-layer optimization

1912
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
when solving.

1913
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
The first layer is

1914
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
to find any point

1915
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
on this cradle front.

1916
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We can call any point

1917
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
a plus solution.

1918
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's just that

1919
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
we need to find

1920
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
the best solution.

1921
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Then we need to

1922
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
minimize the distance.

1923
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So in fact,

1924
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
when solving such a problem,

1925
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
it is actually a double-layer optimization problem.

1926
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Double-layer may come from

1927
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
you have two goal functions.

1928
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Because I just saw that

1929
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
you have some different combinations,

1930
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
maybe four combinations,

1931
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
and each of them involves

1932
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
two goal functions.

1933
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Of course,

1934
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
in optimization,

1935
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
the two goal functions

1936
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
must be a little bit

1937
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
equal to each other.

1938
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
This is more meaningful.

1939
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Otherwise,

1940
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
it's just that both are minimized

1941
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
or both are maximized.

1942
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I can imagine

1943
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that if you have n goal functions,

1944
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
your combination must be

1945
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
c6x2 or something like that.

1946
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm just wondering

1947
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
whether you have ever

1948
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
considered

1949
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
whether it is reasonable to

1950
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
consider more than two goal functions,

1951
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
or even three or more goal functions.

1952
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
OK.

1953
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
There are several ideas.

1954
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
The first idea is

1955
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
that of course we can

1956
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
consider six goal functions.

1957
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Of course we can do

1958
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
c6x2 or 15.

1959
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
However,

1960
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
is it necessary?

1961
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
In fact,

1962
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
between some goal functions,

1963
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
how should I put it?

1964
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
When doing the analysis,

1965
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
we found that

1966
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
the relationship between

1967
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
the higher moment and lower moment

1968
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
is significantly stronger.

1969
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So in this case,

1970
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
when we are doing

1971
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
the so-called tradeoff analysis

1972
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
or when we want to find

1973
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
the relationship between

1974
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
the higher moment

1975
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and lower moment,

1976
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
it is not necessary

1977
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
to consider

1978
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
the so-called

1979
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
two higher moment

1980
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
or two lower moment

1981
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
goal functions.

1982
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Of course,

1983
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
in fact,

1984
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
it can be done,

1985
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and it can also be done mathematically.

1986
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
However,

1987
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
the relationship between the higher moment

1988
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and lower moment

1989
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
may become plateau surface

1990
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
or even higher.

1991
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I believe it can be done mathematically.

1992
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's just that we didn't do

1993
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
such a thing.

1994
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
In addition,

1995
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
when we usually

1996
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
explore the

1997
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Piscitein's maximization,

1998
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
we probably only see

1999
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
at most two goal functions.

2000
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
At present,

2001
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
we only see more than three

2002
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
goal functions.

2003
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Another idea may be that

2004
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
these are some of the

2005
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
characteristics of product CST,

2006
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
so the two characteristics

2007
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
can describe

2008
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
the benefits and

2009
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
disadvantages of this product.

2010
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I see.

2011
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So in most of your cases,

2012
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
it sounds like

2013
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
before you did it,

2014
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
you probably knew

2015
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
how to get

2016
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
which two

2017
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
or how to say

2018
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
which two

2019
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
goal functions

2020
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
have a stronger

2021
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
anti-alignment relationship.

2022
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Yes.

2023
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
In fact, in some

2024
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
earlier studies,

2025
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
it was found that

2026
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
for example,

2027
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
the moment of the goal function

2028
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
is relatively large,

2029
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
its trajectory will become

2030
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
larger in the later stage of the growth rate.

2031
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
On the contrary,

2032
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
if the goal function

2033
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
is composed of small moments,

2034
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
its trajectory will be

2035
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
larger in the early stage of the growth rate.

2036
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Just like this,

2037
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
there will be some

2038
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
ideas that

2039
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
whether the

2040
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
early stage is larger,

2041
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
and the later stage is larger,

2042
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
its trade-off is constant.

2043
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
There is such an idea.

2044
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But the reason why

2045
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
earlier studies

2046
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
can't draw a

2047
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
plateau front like this

2048
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
is because

2049
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
in fact,

2050
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
if I set an alpha,

2051
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I have to solve the

2052
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
optimization problem once.

2053
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
If I use

2054
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
some different

2055
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
so-called solving methods,

2056
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
it may involve

2057
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
some non-variable.

2058
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
In this way,

2059
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I only need one point,

2060
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and I may die.

2061
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Not to mention that

2062
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I have to draw a complete plateau front,

2063
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and I have to find the knee point.

2064
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So earlier studies

2065
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
had this idea,

2066
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
but due to

2067
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
computational burden,

2068
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
they didn't do this in the early stage.

2069
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Until later,

2070
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
the German

2071
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
approach

2072
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
was introduced,

2073
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
we realized that

2074
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
we can quickly

2075
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
measure the

2076
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
trade-off.

2077
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm just curious.

2078
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You probably know

2079
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
the cost of

2080
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
calculation

2081
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
and

2082
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
the complexity

2083
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
of the time

2084
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
to draw a

2085
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
plateau front.

2086
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'm not sure.

2087
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But I can be sure that

2088
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
if today's situation

2089
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
is like this,

2090
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
because of

2091
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
the time limit of

2092
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
this video,

2093
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I didn't show it.

2094
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
In fact,

2095
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
the so-called

2096
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
best

2097
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
U-star

2098
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
solution

2099
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
can be written out.

2100
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It can be written out

2101
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
under some assumptions.

2102
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
But if it's written out,

2103
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
it's just

2104
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
a question of

2105
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
point ODE.

2106
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And the point

2107
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
refers to

2108
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
the initial value problem.

2109
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
So it becomes a very simple

2110
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
solution

2111
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
that can be solved

2112
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
with some

2113
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
false-order solvers.

2114
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
This method

2115
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
is a very

2116
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
competitive reason.

2117
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I see.

2118
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Thank you.

2119
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Anyone else

2120
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
have any questions

2121
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
for the presentation?

2122
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I actually have

2123
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
some questions

2124
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
and some

2125
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
ideas.

2126
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
For example,

2127
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
in our lab,

2128
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
there is a senior

2129
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
who is going to

2130
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
parameterize

2131
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
some

2132
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
particles'

2133
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
positions.

2134
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
In the process of

2135
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
parameterization,

2136
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
he is going to

2137
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
predict

2138
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
the two parameters

2139
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
of Lennard-Jones

2140
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
in a particle.

2141
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
He may

2142
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
have four

2143
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
experimental data

2144
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
that he can

2145
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
take down

2146
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
to fit.

2147
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
At that time,

2148
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
he didn't know

2149
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
which of the four

2150
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
should be taken

2151
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
or not.

2152
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So this is

2153
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
a little bit

2154
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
like a

2155
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
multi-target function.

2156
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'm not sure

2157
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
whether this

2158
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
method

2159
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
can be

2160
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
applied in your field.

2161
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But it reminds me that

2162
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
our senior used

2163
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Bayesian inference.

2164
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
There is an important

2165
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
thing in Bayesian inference,

2166
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
which is the

2167
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
base factor.

2168
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
The base factor

2169
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
can estimate

2170
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
the accuracy

2171
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
after adding

2172
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
a parameter.

2173
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Sometimes,

2174
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
adding one more parameter

2175
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
may not be

2176
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
as good as

2177
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
expected.

2178
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So we use

2179
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
the base factor

2180
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
for multi-target function.

2181
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm curious about the complexity of time.

2182
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Sometimes, when we think about

2183
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
high-end problems,

2184
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
the cost of

2185
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
calculation

2186
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
may not be linear.

2187
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So the senior's

2188
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
method may not be

2189
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
applicable to everything.

2190
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Sometimes, the cost of

2191
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
optimizing is too high.

2192
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
If we consider two parameters

2193
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and get 90% accuracy,

2194
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
the cost may not be

2195
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
as high as

2196
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
expected.

2197
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Actually,

2198
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
we have encountered

2199
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
this problem recently.

2200
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It may be

2201
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
related to this screen.

2202
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
For example,

2203
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
when we are doing

2204
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
production cooperation,

2205
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
we often need to

2206
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
fit some live data.

2207
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
For example,

2208
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
today,

2209
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
a junior

2210
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
is doing a

2211
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
high-polymer analysis

2212
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
project.

2213
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
The reaction of

2214
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
high-polymer analysis

2215
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
is very complicated.

2216
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
There are only 20 or 30

2217
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
power rooms,

2218
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
not to mention

2219
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
each power room

2220
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
has its own parameters.

2221
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So we are thinking

2222
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
how to do fitting

2223
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
so that

2224
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
the model

2225
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
can be built

2226
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
with Aspen Plus

2227
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
or something else.

2228
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
At that time,

2229
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
a junior

2230
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
used a

2231
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
set of

2232
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Bayesian optimization

2233
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
in Python.

2234
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I don't know if you mentioned

2235
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
this just now.

2236
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
There are some projects

2237
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
that have

2238
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
achieved some success

2239
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
with Bayesian

2240
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
optimization.

2241
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I think it should be the same.

2242
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I haven't used Python,

2243
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
but I guess it's

2244
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
similar in theory.

2245
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yes,

2246
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I have

2247
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
encountered a similar problem.

2248
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
For example,

2249
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
we want to build

2250
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
a Cydia model.

2251
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
The problem with this model

2252
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
is that it takes

2253
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
quite a long time

2254
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
to calculate

2255
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
with Aspen.

2256
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
One and a half minutes

2257
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
is not too long,

2258
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
but there are

2259
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
a lot of

2260
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
fittings needed.

2261
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The performance

2262
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
of the computer is also limited.

2263
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I don't know

2264
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
which parameter combination

2265
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
is the best,

2266
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
so I'm trying to

2267
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
find a better

2268
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
fitting method.

2269
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Whether it's

2270
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
good parameters

2271
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
or some

2272
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
uncertainty in code data,

2273
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
it's quite big.

2274
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It's quite a headache for me.

2275
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
It sounds like

2276
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
the idea

2277
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
of machine learning

2278
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
can also be used

2279
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
in some cases.

2280
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Do you want to consider

2281
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
machine learning?

2282
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
No,

2283
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
fitting is just a part

2284
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
of your job.

2285
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I'm just kidding.

2286
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Everyone loves machine learning.

2287
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Actually,

2288
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
since three years ago,

2289
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
some cases

2290
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
of ASP

2291
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
have been

2292
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
doing machine learning.

2293
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
About two years ago,

2294
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
ASP

2295
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
proposed

2296
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
an idea

2297
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
in the AI era.

2298
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
They asked

2299
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
every department

2300
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
to propose a

2301
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
improvement case

2302
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and the improvement

2303
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
would directly affect

2304
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
the popularity of the final exam.

2305
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
At that time,

2306
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
the result was

2307
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
that the manufacturers

2308
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
could only

2309
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
vote

2310
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
to see if

2311
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
they could do it.

2312
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
At that time,

2313
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
we didn't know much about it,

2314
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
so we went to

2315
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
the Department of Mechanical Engineering

2316
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and proposed a case.

2317
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It turned out

2318
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
to be a team

2319
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
of a chemical plant,

2320
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
a chemical plant,

2321
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and a factory.

2322
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
However,

2323
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
we found that

2324
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
there were some shortcomings

2325
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
or uncertainties

2326
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
in the sample data

2327
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
or some damage to the sample data.

2328
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So,

2329
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
the final result

2330
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
was too limited.

2331
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
In my experience,

2332
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
what we could do

2333
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
was quite limited.

2334
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
The results were not very good,

2335
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
but I don't know if it was because

2336
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
we were not

2337
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
well-versed enough.

2338
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I don't know if it was because

2339
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
we were not well-versed enough.

2340
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It was indeed in the development stage.

2341
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Because in the end,

2342
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
you still have to go back to physics.

2343
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
How do you connect

2344
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
with physics in the end?

2345
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
This is also a topic

2346
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
that we have been working on.

2347
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
In addition,

2348
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
this data-driven model

2349
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
is not physically meaningful,

2350
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
so

2351
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
there are a lot of

2352
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
limitations in use.

2353
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
For example, if you want to do a

2354
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
on-site energy saving analysis,

2355
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
it will become

2356
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
impossible to use

2357
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
the data-driven model,

2358
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
because it will

2359
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
make some

2360
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
disruptive changes

2361
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
to the existing operating conditions.

2362
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
This will make it impossible

2363
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
to use the data-based model.

2364
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It is also quite difficult

2365
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
to handle.

2366
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
If you are doing

2367
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
a machine learning

2368
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
that is not chained,

2369
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
it will result in

2370
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
destructive results.

2371
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
So it becomes

2372
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
that for the cases

2373
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
we have received,

2374
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
the extent to which

2375
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
it can be used is quite limited.

2376
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Although they are still

2377
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
in the so-called

2378
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
AI era,

2379
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
in the end,

2380
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
some cases will

2381
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
result in

2382
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
the so-called

2383
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
data-driven model,

2384
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
which will

2385
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
result in

2386
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
disruptive changes

2387
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
to the existing

2388
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
operating conditions.

2389
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
In the end,

2390
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
some cases will

2391
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
result in

2392
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
disruptive changes

2393
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
to the existing

2394
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
operating conditions.

2395
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I will now

2396
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
wrap it up.

2397
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Hello?

2398
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Hello?

2399
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Hello?

2400
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Hello?

2401
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Hello?

2402
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Hello?

2403
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Hello?

2404
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Hello?

2405
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Hello?

2406
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
AI in

2407
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
cases like ours

2408
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
is quite limited.

2409
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
In other words,

2410
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
some cases

2411
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
are not AI,

2412
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
but we still have to

2413
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
wrap it up.

2414
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Yes, that's another point.

2415
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
What do you think

2416
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
about MLD?

2417
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's a bit too flamboyant.

2418
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Yes.

2419
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's easy to

2420
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
wrap it up.

2421
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
It's easy to

2422
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
learn about

2423
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
quantum mechanics.

2424
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's easy to

2425
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
become flamboyant.

2426
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Yes, it's a bit

2427
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
too flamboyant.

2428
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
It's data-driven,

2429
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
and it can't return to physics.

2430
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's not reasonable.

2431
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
If it returns to physics,

2432
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
it's still

2433
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
very limited.

2434
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yes.

2435
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Of course,

2436
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
this has nothing to do with

2437
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
today's topic,

2438
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
but we did encounter

2439
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
some

2440
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
problems.

2441
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Are there any other questions?

2442
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
If not,

2443
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
it's about time

2444
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
to wrap up.

2445
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Thank you,

2446
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Haoran,

2447
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
for your presentation.

2448
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Thank you,

2449
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
everyone.

2450
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It's been a long time

2451
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
since I've heard

2452
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
this kind of thing.

2453
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
It's about time

2454
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
to have

2455
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
supper or lunch.

2456
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
If you want to

2457
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
participate in our

2458
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
next half year's

2459
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
presentation,

2460
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
you can sign up for

2461
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Tera's membership.

2462
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
We'll have more

2463
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
information about it.

2464
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Thank you, everyone.

2465
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Good night, everyone.

2466
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Thank you, everyone.

2467
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Bye-bye.

2468
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Bye-bye, everyone.

2469
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Why did you suddenly

2470
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
stop talking?

2471
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I just wanted to

2472
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
show my presence.
