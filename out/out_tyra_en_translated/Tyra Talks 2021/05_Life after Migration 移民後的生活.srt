1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let me start by introducing Annie.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Annie completed her Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Sydney, Australia last year.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
She is currently a Senior Research Officer at the University of Technology Sydney,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
working closely with the Associate Dean of Indigenous Land and Justice Research Hub.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Before completing her Ph.D., Annie was awarded a Master by Research and a Master of Cultural Studies

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
with Gender and Cultural Studies, also at the University of Sydney.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Her research interests include human geography, labor and spouse immigration, urban planning,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
circular migration in the South Pacific, resource and livelihood,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Southern Asian studies, rural economics, Australian aid, the end of the user experiences,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
remittances, and substantial development.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Annie is fluent in English, Mandarin, Tartoon, and Taiwanese.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's start with Annie.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you, everyone.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd like to go over my topic for today.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
My topic is Life After Migration, Migration, Urbanization, and Mobility in Geography.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Geography is the capital of a country called Timor-Leste.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can see a cute little house on my PowerPoint.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
According to Taiwanese, it's a traditional sacred house.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When I was still doing my Ph.D.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I lived in the Far East for about seven months.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I worked there from the end of 2018 to the beginning of 2019.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
As the host mentioned, I speak Tartoon.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Many of my interviews were done in English plus Tartoon.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After I returned to Australia, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sydney.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I went to UTS, the University of Sydney Technology, as a Senior Research Officer.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In the U.S., I would be considered an Assistant Researcher or Assistant Professor.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But in Australia, we have a clear distinction.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So I only do research.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't teach this semester.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I don't call myself a professor.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In Australia, we have professors, assistant professors, and professors.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We don't have an assistant professor.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So we have lecturers, senior lecturers, and associate professors.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
As you can see from my PowerPoint,

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to talk about East Taiwan and Australia.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I know that most of our listeners are in Taiwan or the U.S.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So you may not know much about the South Pacific.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think this is what makes lecturing valuable.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It shows us that there are different possibilities in life.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Of course, it's still a research topic.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I'm still going to talk about what I'm studying.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is my method?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
From a geographical perspective,

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
what's the point of living there for seven months?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What else did I discover?

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So the first point I'm talking about is resource management.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So why is it useful to do research in this small country?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it useful for Australia or Taiwan?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or is it useful for them?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My Ph.D. was covered by an Australian aid program.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Australian aid is the same as U.S. aid.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Australian aid was used to assist the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Taiwan used to receive aid.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We used to have U.S. aid.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So it's a miracle for Taiwan's economy.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But we can think about whether we can replicate this in other countries.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or what direction can Taiwan's aid be in the future on the South Pacific?

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So I'm going to talk about its resources.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My PowerPoint has oil.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And it's very young.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And you can't find a job in the local area.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's the point of today.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Remittances is right.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As long as it's a private loan, it's called remittances.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's different from A.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A is government-to-government agreement.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But remittances can be sent from Australia to Boxuan for $100.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is remittances.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So a lot of people would like to send people abroad to work or study.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And there are a lot of natural resources in the local area.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So there's coconut, palm oil, and coffee.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So my first point is that there are a lot of Australian aid projects.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
One of them is the Australian Seasonal Workers Program that I did.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's very similar to the plan for Taiwanese to go to Australia for holiday work.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But the biggest difference is that Taiwanese or Australians are free to go to Australia for holiday work.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because they're holiday workers.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But this is a South Pacific island.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Only workers from countries supported by Australia can come.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They're government-to-government agreements.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's a bit like our diplomatic model plan.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So workers are actually treated very well in Australia.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because this is the face of the country.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And it's government-to-government agreements.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So if Taiwanese go to Australia for holiday work,

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you have to find a job, find a house, apply for a visa, and do everything yourself.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But if it's a Pacific islander, like Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and my Timorese workers,

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
they're already set up.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Everything's set up for you.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
All you have to do is fly over.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So that's a very different thing.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And they often have ambassadors from Pacific islands to see the workers.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Make sure they are treated very well.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is a big difference.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So a lot of people, because of the support of this plan,

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
they can buy land or build a house when they return to their home country.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or a lot of islanders like to party.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So a lot of it is spent on the maintenance of social networks.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The third and final point I want to talk about is

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
what I find challenging.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
As a woman, and as you can see, I'm not white.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I'm from Australia.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm Australian, I'm Taiwanese, I'm Hakka.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this is how I negotiated my positionality.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Of course, sometimes it's boring when you first go.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And basically, as long as they see you as a woman,

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they'll think you're a high-ranking wife or something.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They won't respect me as a professor.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Sexism and xenophobia.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is what I'm talking about.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In fact, a lot of Pacific islanders have Chinese roots.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But how do Chinese people get along with them locally?

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That will actually affect how they see my role.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or I'll talk about how I often walk on the road and get touched by children.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or pull my hair or something.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I can speak local dialect.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So when I use local dialect to scare them, they'll be surprised.

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, this foreigner can speak local dialect.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And he seems to be from Australia.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They're scared when they see someone from Australia.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because the role of Don Lee-Woon is very ambiguous.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's a bit of an Australian colonial enemy.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I'll talk a little bit about the history of Don Lee-Woon and Australian roles.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So we need to know where T-Mall is.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Where is Australia?

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So you may have no problem with geography in this regard.

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Where is Australia?

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is a map of the United States.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So the size of Australia is actually about the same size as that of the United States and Canada.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don Lee-Woon is on this small island in the north.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a very small island.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's actually very small.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's smaller than Taiwan.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But the complexity of its population is actually similar to that of Taiwan.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because it has a mountainous terrain.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's quite similar to Taiwan.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mountainous.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And there are only two seasons, dry season and rainy season.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was so happy when I went there in August.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's about 40 degrees every day.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
By November or December, like now, it's rainy season.

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You go out every day like this to pick water.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In such a situation, it also has a lot of products.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because there is a lot of rainwater, you can grow anything you want to live.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So there are a lot of things.

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll pick a few first.

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The first one is why I did this PhD.

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because Australians think it's important.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because there is oil in the back garden of Australia.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So you can see it on this map.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Australia is here.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And then there's a small island on top of it.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's Papua New Guinea.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Next to it is Indonesia.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So it's about the 17th century.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Portuguese came and took over Papua New Guinea.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then it's been there for over 300 years.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Basically, the number of buildings is not very large.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If I want to be more diplomatic.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The Portuguese brought them nothing but singing, dancing, Latin names and Catholicism.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's not even a railway.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And they didn't build a university.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So in fact, the Portuguese are the characters over there.

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I want your sandals.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm the sandalwood.

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The locals used to talk about sandalwood, but now they don't.

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't want to do a lot more construction.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But in the post-Papua New Guinea colonial era.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It was from the 1960s to the 1970s.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Natural gas was discovered in the East.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's the kind of natural gas that you can light up in your backyard.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Natural gas floats up from the ground like this.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course, the Portuguese didn't have the Renaissance Revolution.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So I don't want to be able to pick it up.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But they found a lot of Indonesian businessmen who were actually very interested.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Australia is also very interested.

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The United States is also very interested.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the end, Indonesia's stronghold next to it was occupied by Dongding in 1975.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And then Australia signed a contract with Indonesia and said,

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hey, let's open the Timo Sea Oil below you, okay?

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's their cooperation.

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But because Indonesia was independent in 1975 to 2002.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's construction between 25 years.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There's a university and there's a lot of scholarships.

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And then there's actually a little bit of the whole domestic economy of Dongding.

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There's a construction infrastructure.

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But he killed a lot of people after all.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
In the 1992 massacre in Santa Mascara.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The issue of human rights in Dongding caused strong interest in the international community.

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, of course, in the end, Indonesia was there.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ah, there's no way to go on.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And then the United Nations sent troops.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, in 1999, they had the world's first record.

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's an independent referendum.

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then it was decided that a lot of people who were close to 99% decided to be independent.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We want our own country.

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We don't want to be a province in Indonesia.

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So they're independent.

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So, from 1999 to 2000, the UN sent troops.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Most of the people in the UN are American or Australian.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So Australia and his ambiguous relationship has been going on for a long time.

203
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But now it's officially the UN sent troops.

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So what about the oil treaty between Indonesia and Australia?

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So they're renegotiating the bond.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then it becomes the oil of Dongding and all kinds of natural resources start to be exploited.

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And maybe there's a bigger chance that they're going to let their own people manage their own resources.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So then they set up a team.

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Petroleum fund.

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's about putting the oil revenue into the country's reserve fund.

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In Taiwan, it's called redistribution fund.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And then we're going to talk about whether or not the money has been used properly.

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And then there's the whole situation of the people's livelihood.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But in addition to oil, they have pretty good coffee.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes, I put a picture of Fairtrade's Timor-Leste coffee.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And a lot of coconut.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There's a province in the east called Los Barros.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They produce a lot of good quality coconut.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I put the Dongding sea water I shot there.

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Their sea water is really clear.

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I haven't been to Palau.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But I heard from some of my friends who have been to Palau.

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He said that the feeling of looking under the Dongding sea water is similar to that of Palau.

224
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's very beautiful and pollution-free.

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So it's actually very rich in marine resources.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then there's the most important resource.

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it's also about determining whether or not this country can develop the most important resource, which is people.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's take a look at the demography of Timor-Leste.

229
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Look at the population.

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It looks very young.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Most people are under the age of 25.

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When I was in the Dongding sea water, I was over 30 years old.

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But young people over the age of 10 are at a loss.

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But if someone looks very old, like over 50 years old.

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It will be respected by the local community.

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because we can see that there is a gap between the population pyramid 35 to 39.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then we can push it back a little bit.

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They had a war more than 20 years ago.

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
At that time, it was those 18-year-old men who were going to serve in the military.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Usually quite a lot of people died on the battlefield.

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So now they are about 40 years old.

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then there is the population pyramid.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It is in the age bracket of 35 to 45 years old.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There will be a shortage.

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So because there was a civil war before.

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So a lot of people just can't do it.

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In this situation, develop their own personal economy.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Or the development of life.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Basically caused a lot of problems.

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Then we are going to talk about the role of Australia in the development of the East China Sea.

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because I just said that there are Chinese people in the East China Sea.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So basically 75 years ago.

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Many Chinese people in the East China Sea came to Taiwan to study.

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because at that time they were members of the Republic of China.

255
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And there is a consulate in Dili.

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because they are part of Portugal.

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
At that time, Portugal had diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So from the founding of the Republic of China to 1975.

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
In fact, the relationship between Taiwan and East China Sea has always been very good.

260
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
A lot of people came to Australia because of the war.

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Most of them are Chinese.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
50%.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Most Chinese people in East China Sea are very good.

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And rich.

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So at that time, they could either choose to go to Taiwan to study.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Then a lot of people went to Taiwan to study.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then apply for a refugee visa to Australia.

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Or some people settled directly in Taiwan.

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Not necessarily.

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So now there is a census in Australia.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I mean they are Australian.

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They are Australian citizens.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Or permanent residents.

274
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Just like there are green cards in the United States.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There are about 10,000 people.

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Of course, there are a few workers.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Or people who study abroad.

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
These may not be included in the census.

279
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But Australia has always had a very close relationship with the East China Sea.

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So when we talk about immigration theory.

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Excuse me.

282
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You just said 10,000 people.

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is this a high proportion of the population of East China Sea?

284
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, because the population of East China Sea is only 1.3 million.

285
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, OK.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Almost 1% of the population.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes, almost 1% of the population are in Australia.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So Australia is very important to them.

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like me and the East China Sea Embassy in Sydney.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's a very good relationship.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The Embassy may come to me for a cup of coffee.

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So they will say.

293
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They usually send people to Australia.

294
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Must be looking for the best, the highest level.

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just like Taiwan sent to Washington.

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Is a peak of your diplomatic career.

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So what we are talking about in immigration theory.

298
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Migration has a push and pull factor.

299
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is that push and pull.

300
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What is your birthplace?

301
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How bad is it to let you send you out?

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Or the place you moved to.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Like the United States or Australia.

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How good is it to let you stay?

305
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So what I'm talking about in this PowerPoint.

306
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it the push and pull factor of the East China Sea?

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We can take a look.

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because it's not very urbanized.

309
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
31%

310
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And this is last year's data.

311
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So 31% means.

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
70% of people actually live in rural areas.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So think about it.

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If you are Taiwanese.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What was Taiwan like more than 40 years ago?

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That feeling.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Maybe more than 40 years ago.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Taiwan's literacy level may be a little higher.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
A little bit.

320
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't have that data.

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Then they have a very important reason.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Is the young unemployed population.

323
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Because there are really not too many buildings on the island.

324
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So if you go to college.

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They now have about 7 specializations.

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Plus college.

327
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But after going to college.

328
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you want to find a job?

329
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The unemployment rate is 12.3.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The unemployment rate in Australia.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The overall unemployment rate.

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's very high after COVID.

333
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Our very high is only 6%.

334
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then this country.

335
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The unemployment rate on the island is 12.3%.

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then his population is only.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
1.3 million.

338
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And most of it is a very young population.

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's the middle of the year.

340
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Because of the war.

341
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There is no.

342
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Their minimum wage.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
$150 a month.

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Is to do labor work.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I can only make about $5,000 a month.

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But their official currency.

347
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's in US dollars again.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because there is no ability to.

349
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There is no central bank to issue their own currency.

350
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So it's in US dollars.

351
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then a dollar or less.

352
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There's that little coin.

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's called Saint.

354
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's Portuguese.

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Saint.

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They were in 2002.

357
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
After independence.

358
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And then there's something like that.

359
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The civil war.

360
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a little bit of an Indian.

361
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
With that one.

362
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
A little bit of a local.

363
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And there may be people from Australia.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's a little bit of a conflict.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So that's in 2006.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Plus they're actually.

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In 2014.

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
With Australia.

369
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because of the oil.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And there's a hearing.

371
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's right.

372
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because I'm not a political expert.

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I'm not going to go into detail.

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But we can find out.

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a big problem.

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So I'm going to repost.

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So we.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So many resources.

379
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How does it help the development of this country?

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Or is it just a resource curse?

381
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There's oil, but.

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's like oil revenue.

383
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's not owned by the people.

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Economic development is not up.

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So then later.

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The Australian government did something.

387
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just like I just said today.

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Australian seasonal workers program.

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
To put this.

390
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The diplomatic.

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It should be said that the diplomatic.

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Political ambition.

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
With the purpose of economic development.

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Wrap it up into one.

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Is that it can make both sides.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Can accept the immigration plan.

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So what about this plan?

398
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I have a net.

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And this one on top is mine.

400
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He's in one.

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He's in one.

402
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
He's probably.

403
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Because because the islanders.

404
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They don't have that many people.

405
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Can go to college.

406
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So as long as this plan has.

407
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can join when you're in high school.

408
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That might be 18 to 45 years old.

409
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's going to be very capable.

410
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So they're going to have some physical tests.

411
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's like Kang.

412
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's not Kang Sabao.

413
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But it's a little bit like jumping.

414
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Something like that.

415
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Can be that.

416
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then there's the hospital.

417
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I just realized.

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm going to Australia.

419
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Is to the farm or.

420
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Because it's a diplomatic plan.

421
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So it's not the same as the resort.

422
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
They can go to some.

423
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Places on the Australian coast.

424
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
There's a place in the northwest of Australia.

425
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You can have that.

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The industry.

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So it's like that.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Remote hospitality.

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They can actually do it too.

430
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There's a pretty big one.

431
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The focus is on me.

432
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Talking about it.

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Australia is the first world.

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So if it's a job search.

435
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Like me.

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can only have my name.

437
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But if today.

438
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Assuming my last name is changed.

439
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I might be Chinese.

440
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And then your application.

441
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm not going to put up a picture.

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

443
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You can only have your academic experience.

444
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In order to avoid that.

445
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Right.

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The discrimination of competitors.

447
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But if this plan.

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It allows you to do overseas recruitment.

449
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's a big deal.

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's a big deal.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So they can do it.

452
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Any kind of test.

453
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What kind of people do they want to pick?

454
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go to Australia to work.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Those who want to use.

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Want to join this government.

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Plan.

458
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Approve employer.

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They have to pay.

460
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Those migrant workers' visas.

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Residence.

462
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And air tickets.

463
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Although it's still deducted from their salary.

464
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We call it deduction.

465
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But this is basically.

466
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There will be a lot of convenience.

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can actually.

468
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
If I'm the owner.

469
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I can pick anyone I want.

470
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And those in Australia.

471
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The law may be very unauthorized.

472
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like this.

473
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You can't have pregnant people.

474
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Or.

475
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
People who used to do business.

476
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's in there.

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But this is in Australia.

478
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Local laws are not allowed.

479
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If someone is pregnant or married.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If you resign.

481
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The government will shut down.

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But this is basically.

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You can do a lot of tricks.

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So.

485
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In this situation.

486
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This plan.

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
A lot of migrant workers.

488
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The islanders.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They are all very.

490
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I should say it's a local business.

491
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So.

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is also an implication.

493
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The Australian government also hopes.

494
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We are the best on the island.

495
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They should be able to contribute to the local community.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Help this country.

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Can develop.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So I made a picture here.

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
These workers may be.

500
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
In.

501
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Regional Australia in the Australian countryside.

502
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What do you do?

503
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And then the money.

504
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He might just send it back.

505
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
To his wife and children.

506
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They will build a house there.

507
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then raise some pigs.

508
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Or buy some farmland.

509
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The so-called economic effect.

510
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
From just a family.

511
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Expand to a whole community.

512
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
With a whole country.

513
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is their original expectation.

514
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But we can look at this thing.

515
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Is it feasible?

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Because people.

517
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You can't put the money.

518
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Give the money to others.

519
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It has nothing to do with you.

520
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So this project must be big enough.

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Its impact will be big enough.

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Because I won't just send money to me.

523
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
A stranger.

524
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I might just give it to my brothers and sisters.

525
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
To my family.

526
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So this thing.

527
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We will talk about the so-called academic.

528
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We will say it is a.

529
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Bottom-up approach.

530
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Not that top-down.

531
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But also these two.

532
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Approach.

533
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
At the same time there is that power.

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So the development of this country.

535
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It may only rise.

536
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But we can see that his current ratio is still.

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
31% still in Petroleum.

538
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
With oil.

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Then 26% in natural gas.

540
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
22% in coffee.

541
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Is raw coffee.

542
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Then there are some other things.

543
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Basically it is very small.

544
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Then I said.

545
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was doing research at the beginning.

546
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I do household survey.

547
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Then a local family.

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There are probably 11 or 12 people.

549
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Imagine 45 years ago in Taiwan.

550
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because they are every.

551
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Because women will be born.

552
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Seven children in a lifetime.

553
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you see three or four.

554
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That may be a senior official.

555
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Pressure or something.

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Maybe three or four are very few.

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So I was.

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
A total of 52 families interviewed.

559
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Then there are about 11 or 12 people in each.

560
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
If the child does not count.

561
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I just do one.

562
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Similar to the focus group.

563
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The nationality.

564
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then ask them.

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Asked some questions.

566
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
May be.

567
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because I mainly want to know.

568
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
How do they spend money?

569
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What did you buy?

570
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Something like that.

571
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I also chased those workers.

572
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
From the countryside of Australia.

573
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
This is me.

574
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Field map.

575
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
In Kunshan in the north.

576
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Because Australia is a basketball.

577
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So our north is a tropical.

578
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I remember that time.

579
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I drove for a long time.

580
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Maybe half an hour.

581
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I did not see anything.

582
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Australia is very big.

583
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
After 25 minutes.

584
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I only see nothing.

585
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
In the middle of nowhere.

586
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They may live next door.

587
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Accommodation.

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's it.

589
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That kind of house.

590
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Six months back once.

591
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Six months back to the east.

592
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I was.

593
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I was studying for a PhD.

594
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Second year or third year.

595
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I just followed them.

596
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
About six or seven months.

597
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Then use WhatsApp and Facebook.

598
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Contact them.

599
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When they are ready to go home.

600
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Very simple.

601
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I just followed them home.

602
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So I can know.

603
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What do they use money for?

604
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So the result I got later.

605
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Where did they spend the money?

606
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I came to a conclusion.

607
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Basically.

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
36% of people.

609
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Spend the money on.

610
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Build a house.

611
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is easy to understand.

612
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because.

613
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Their traditional house.

614
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's a straw house.

615
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I really think the straw house is great.

616
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's very cool to live there.

617
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's a bit like Taiwan.

618
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The traditional house.

619
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You are the kind of tropical area.

620
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Of course it's a straw house.

621
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But if it rains.

622
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Make a big water.

623
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The straw house is washed away.

624
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So they still basically.

625
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Want to build that kind of western style.

626
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Big house.

627
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Then there are tropical colors.

628
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Maybe the most is orange.

629
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Red and green.

630
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Then there will be 27% of people.

631
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Want to do business.

632
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Then I basically.

633
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Three or four days ago at the National University of Australia.

634
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
There is another online conference.

635
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Then there are many.

636
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Development practitioners will say.

637
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
How do they use western ideas.

638
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Think about it.

639
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
These islanders should take the money.

640
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Then we should teach them how.

641
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Financial literacy.

642
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is very.

643
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Western colonialist view.

644
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I teach you how to use money.

645
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then I said at that time.

646
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Say.

647
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No one is going to work for someone else.

648
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Once they come back from Australia.

649
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's it.

650
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You have been working so hard in Australia.

651
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And there are white people.

652
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Not necessarily white people.

653
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Is the boss.

654
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then why do you come back?

655
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Still continue to work for white people.

656
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Or what kind of person is Australian?

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Many people want to come back.

658
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I just want to be my own boss.

659
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So this is basically.

660
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think it's a great market.

661
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
They will be.

662
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Can take this money.

663
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Some people are from Indonesia.

664
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
There are many small and medium-sized businesses in Southeast Asia.

665
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There are some people who are because of war.

666
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
May be young.

667
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Their younger sibling.

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There is no way to complete education.

669
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So many of them.

670
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Also invest in education.

671
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Will send.

672
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Will send their younger brothers and sisters.

673
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Go to Indonesia to study.

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Because actually.

675
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
As you know.

676
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The nearest western country there.

677
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It is Australia, New Zealand.

678
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But the tuition is really expensive.

679
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That is a year.

680
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It is also 40,000 to 50,000 US dollars.

681
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That.

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Go to other places.

683
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Asian countries like Singapore.

684
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The competition is too big.

685
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Taiwan did not provide scholarships.

686
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The most convenient is Indonesia.

687
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So many people have mentioned.

688
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They want to go back to college.

689
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
May be going to Indonesia.

690
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We may feel in Taiwan.

691
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It is a very advanced country.

692
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But after all.

693
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That is also the Northeast.

694
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So Indonesia for them.

695
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In fact, the level of development is also very high.

696
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And it is a very good choice.

697
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So many people.

698
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
In addition to these three.

699
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Build a house and do business.

700
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Also invest in education.

701
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Many people also bought it.

702
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I bought some pigs in the countryside.

703
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Domestic animals.

704
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Basically more pigs.

705
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Or chicken.

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Or cash crops.

707
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Mango trees.

708
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Many people buy banana trees.

709
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Mango trees.

710
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And coconut.

711
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Some are quite a lot.

712
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Sorry.

713
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Can you go back to the top?

714
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I have two questions.

715
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The first one is.

716
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
These are all interviews, right?

717
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I saw the data.

718
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
All interviews.

719
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
In fact, I also double verify.

720
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because many times.

721
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What they want to do with him.

722
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Not the same.

723
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because of me.

724
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Only through Western Union.

725
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's Australia.

726
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I actually have an Australian.

727
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The office asked for the approximate value.

728
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Then I asked again.

729
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Then I went to the interviewer.

730
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Can you show me what you bought?

731
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What did you buy?

732
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Because I still have a point.

733
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Many people tell me.

734
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He bought a chicken.

735
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Do business.

736
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In fact, he went to sell chickens.

737
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Because they fight chickens.

738
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There is a girl who told me.

739
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
How much did he spend?

740
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
When I went home to count.

741
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
6,000 less.

742
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So where did he spend 6,000?

743
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You ask him directly.

744
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Where is the missing 6,000?

745
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's embarrassing.

746
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The next day, his friend invited me to drink coffee.

747
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
When I was working.

748
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
With a special man.

749
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Come back to have a baby.

750
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Not his husband.

751
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So the 6,000 dollars.

752
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In fact, it was a baby born in Australia.

753
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's too embarrassing.

754
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He didn't want to tell me.

755
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I said OK.

756
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I spent about 3,000.

757
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Understand.

758
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Another question.

759
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because this is like.

760
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it back from Australia?

761
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it's a bit like.

762
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know if this question is right.

763
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
For those who are already.

764
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
For these local families.

765
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's like this.

766
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So it's like this.

767
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The ratio of income.

768
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Is it also applicable to the general.

769
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The ratio of income they originally had.

770
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It should be said that.

771
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The way they use this money.

772
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's different from the way they usually use money.

773
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Or are they using the same.

774
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Almost the same ratio.

775
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This question.

776
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You really know how to ask questions.

777
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I think this is worth it.

778
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
1 million questions.

779
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because basically the islanders.

780
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Do you know that their salary is very low?

781
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So 150 dollars.

782
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Basically, this money is for them.

783
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Windfall fell from the sky.

784
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Sit down money.

785
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And a lot of people in the countryside.

786
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They don't need money.

787
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You have to imagine that Taiwan.

788
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Even in the 50s and 60s.

789
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
They actually don't need money.

790
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Because they are obligated.

791
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's said that there is often that.

792
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We drove by.

793
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
My colleague is a documentary director.

794
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
He will talk a lot.

795
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Hey, that sister.

796
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I use candles to exchange corn with you, OK?

797
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So they are basically still.

798
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
A lot of rural people are in the original economy.

799
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So this money is for them.

800
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Some of my workers.

801
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They are.

802
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Sent 6,000 yuan.

803
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
6,000 dollars back.

804
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That's very big for them.

805
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's completely zero money.

806
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The gift that fell from the sky.

807
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Because they used to be.

808
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What do you eat?

809
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Maybe 100 times a month.

810
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There is no such system.

811
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So this is extra.

812
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
In addition to their livelihood system.

813
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Can you answer this?

814
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because I will ask these two questions.

815
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In fact, there is one in economics.

816
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A very important theory.

817
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If you say today.

818
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Maybe your income today.

819
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You may use this ratio to spend.

820
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Then if you say today.

821
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Give you 100 more.

822
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's like a hundred dollars that fell from the sky.

823
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
How do you make a choice?

824
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It is very possible that you will spend a sum of money.

825
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
To invest or a sum of money.

826
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
When you get it.

827
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Just spend it all.

828
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You may want to save it.

829
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Let you in the future.

830
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Have a certain consumption.

831
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So that your consumption can be smooth.

832
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Let your overall life level go up.

833
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But this thing is not always.

834
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
There should be some information.

835
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But not like this.

836
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
A very good piece of information.

837
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Because this state.

838
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
For us, it may be okay.

839
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But for the locals.

840
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This may be a big state.

841
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
How do you use it?

842
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
If the quality of the information is very good.

843
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In fact, it is quite suitable.

844
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So I will ask like this.

845
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So I feel very curious.

846
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Really.

847
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we see this pie chart.

848
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
In fact, I asked.

849
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
They did not mention buying food or what.

850
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Because you usually want to buy food.

851
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You go to kill your backyard chicken.

852
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Or you go.

853
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Use candles to exchange for corn.

854
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
All they talk about is.

855
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I took this.

856
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is to build a house.

857
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I bought a car.

858
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Or what.

859
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Then they did not even talk about buying a mobile phone.

860
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
At that time I was.

861
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Fortunately, you asked.

862
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I asked.

863
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Don't a lot of people buy iphone?

864
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Or what.

865
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Then I found out.

866
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I really live in the local area.

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I found out.

868
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I really ask.

869
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You are too naive.

870
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You know their network is super bad.

871
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And everyone wants to buy that phone card and network.

872
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Then they bought a mobile phone.

873
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So a lot of people say.

874
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He may be working here.

875
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
He wants to talk to his girlfriend.

876
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
He wants to buy a mobile phone for him.

877
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
A smart phone for his girlfriend.

878
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But this is not a remittance.

879
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's because they've been working in Australia for a long time.

880
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I bought it.

881
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So those are gifts.

882
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
They brought it all back.

883
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What rice cooker.

884
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I was wondering why.

885
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No electronic device.

886
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But they actually bought it first.

887
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So these are the ones.

888
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because these are the ones that can only be used locally.

889
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So yeah.

890
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This is probably.

891
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And then later.

892
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I've been living there for a long time.

893
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll find out.

894
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
They're actually in the process of urbanization.

895
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
There are quietly going on.

896
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Although they are urbanized.

897
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
About 30 percent.

898
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
About 70 percent.

899
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Most of them still live in the countryside.

900
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But in fact.

901
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This transition is also happening.

902
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
From that general.

903
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They actually have one.

904
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
The only shopping center in the country.

905
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's called Timo Plaza.

906
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's a bit like when I was still in Taiwan.

907
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
When I was in fifth or sixth grade.

908
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
My hometown is Taichung.

909
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I go to the first square.

910
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It was about 20 years ago.

911
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The level of Taichung's first square.

912
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't know what other areas are.

913
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
There are some.

914
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Chinese businessmen from other places.

915
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Come over there to sell some small things.

916
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Or goods or something.

917
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So basically a lot.

918
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But most of them are.

919
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because of the war.

920
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So a lot of that.

921
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The road is the whole.

922
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It was when the UN army came.

923
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Get rid of it.

924
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So a lot of countries like Japan.

925
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
JICA.

926
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
What exchange association.

927
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I helped them in.

928
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
There are also Koka in Korea.

929
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
China's Belt and Road.

930
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Also fixed a lot.

931
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Of course there is.

932
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
USA in the United States of America.

933
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Also have this.

934
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So there are gradually roads in the countryside.

935
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But this is a very sticky situation.

936
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
They have a road but no streetlights.

937
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So I really.

938
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It was a long adventure for me at the time.

939
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If I go out at night.

940
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I have to have a flashlight.

941
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Otherwise it's pretty dangerous.

942
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's another one.

943
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I think it makes me feel even more.

944
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
A big change is because.

945
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
According to Marx's theory.

946
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Capital transfer.

947
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Also.

948
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
How do you get the capital.

949
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
To support you.

950
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Your own activity.

951
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The change.

952
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
To see the change of this era.

953
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So they also started from.

954
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The.

955
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Sell ​​small things in the market.

956
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Also advanced.

957
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That is to say.

958
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Maybe it's like a sales service.

959
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like the one on my right.

960
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
There are buses.

961
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So their buses.

962
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This service is only available in the capital.

963
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If I was going to the countryside.

964
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I have to take a truck.

965
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's really a truck.

966
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Then.

967
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Because I'm a foreigner.

968
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
There will be some goods on the truck.

969
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Like this.

970
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If you want to take a truck.

971
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You have to do it with the chicken and the sheep.

972
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I will.

973
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
If you use the power of money.

974
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Then give me two more dollars.

975
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I can sit next to him.

976
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't have to.

977
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Travel with animals.

978
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Of course.

979
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
These workers.

980
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
A lot of money.

981
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
$6,000, $7,000, $10,000.

982
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
A lot in the local area.

983
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I asked the least.

984
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's the kind.

985
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
He's not quite used to Australian life.

986
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's the first season.

987
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
He might only have 3,000.

988
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But if it's the kind.

989
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I've been to Australia four or five times.

990
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
They're very good.

991
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
They can save a year.

992
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
One season is six or seven months.

993
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's close to $20,000.

994
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I want to say I'm a university professor.

995
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I can't save that much.

996
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm a moonlight group.

997
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
If you go back, you're basically considered.

998
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a new father's class.

999
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So this.

1000
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is actually in.

1001
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
In fact, in terms of local people.

1002
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This will break.

1003
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Break some.

1004
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Maybe that person.

1005
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
He's usually in.

1006
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Uh, in the local society.

1007
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
His original class.

1008
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's not that.

1009
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And then he might go back.

1010
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
With a lot of money.

1011
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Like Taiwan said.

1012
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Explosive or greedy.

1013
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's just that feeling.

1014
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's also a lot.

1015
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Uh, in the local area.

1016
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's a hot topic.

1017
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Like I went to the countryside for an interview.

1018
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They want to say.

1019
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So that means I'm here to ask you.

1020
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Can I get into that?

1021
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
They'll be right.

1022
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This thing is really going abroad to work.

1023
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Create an Australian dream.

1024
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This thing can be.

1025
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's a way to make me rich in an instant.

1026
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
But in fact.

1027
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
When I was doing the interview.

1028
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'll find out.

1029
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A lot of people.

1030
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I want to pursue this Australian dream.

1031
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But in the end, you're done.

1032
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
We can see him build a house.

1033
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Progress.

1034
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Some people may be more.

1035
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So he might have gone.

1036
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Two seasons.

1037
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
About 10,000.

1038
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And then the house on the left.

1039
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Just build a small house.

1040
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But some people may be ambitious.

1041
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Or what?

1042
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Like this house.

1043
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's the backyard of our house.

1044
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
He also went to Australia.

1045
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But because it seems like only one season.

1046
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Or what?

1047
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's just that the money hasn't been sent back.

1048
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The whole house is embarrassing.

1049
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So his house has no roof.

1050
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
He can only live on the first floor.

1051
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The second floor has not been returned because of the money.

1052
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And then maybe my wife is.

1053
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The second floor has no roof.

1054
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The whole house can't be built.

1055
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So this is actually.

1056
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There is the so-called.

1057
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That kind of meeting effect.

1058
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But the meeting effect.

1059
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Is there really that much?

1060
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or can it always be a continuous thing?

1061
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It is also necessary to see.

1062
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Or there is.

1063
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
In Taiwan, we are in the Japanese era.

1064
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
There is self-love.

1065
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But not in Tokyo until now.

1066
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
To my picture below.

1067
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The picture is standing next to the Tokyo girl.

1068
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's Australia and the Tokyo flag.

1069
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This word is called Beirun.

1070
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Beirun means water well.

1071
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So the Australians donated a well here.

1072
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That's in the urban area.

1073
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What are they doing in line?

1074
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They are queuing for water.

1075
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Because only foreigners live.

1076
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Or high-ranking families.

1077
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
There is tap water.

1078
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's usually.

1079
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
A group of people is going to.

1080
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Water station.

1081
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Or the water tower to get water.

1082
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What do they usually drink?

1083
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They are the main water.

1084
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Or buy that kind of imported water.

1085
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I remember when I was there.

1086
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The first thing I wake up every morning.

1087
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I opened my faucet.

1088
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Because I was sitting.

1089
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
In the house of the British consul.

1090
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Then I opened the faucet.

1091
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
There is water.

1092
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I just put that pool of water.

1093
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I just.

1094
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There is something like a piece of water.

1095
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Then I use that water all day.

1096
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
To brush your teeth.

1097
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Wash your face.

1098
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Then I go to the supermarket.

1099
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Buy water.

1100
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So basically a lot of people.

1101
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
After working home.

1102
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
The first thing they see when they buy a house.

1103
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Like Taiwanese people look at the location.

1104
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Did you enter the train station?

1105
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
What is the bus station?

1106
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Their first preference.

1107
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Enter the water tower.

1108
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
There must be a well and a water tower next to it.

1109
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Because there is no tap water.

1110
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
This is also a very different thing.

1111
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Then I have this picture below.

1112
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
There is a German-Austrian geography.

1113
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Annual photography award.

1114
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That is.

1115
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They.

1116
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I was in the market at that time.

1117
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Take a truck to the side.

1118
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
When I was doing a rural interview.

1119
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I took a sneak shot.

1120
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Their truck is usually a bit like.

1121
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Thai song.

1122
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Or the Philippine tattoo.

1123
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Everyone will sit in the back.

1124
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Then the driver sits in front.

1125
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Then there is no sign or anything.

1126
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So you just follow the water.

1127
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But my interviewee.

1128
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
When he came back.

1129
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Bought a truck.

1130
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
He said he wanted to do this business.

1131
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Because in a public transportation.

1132
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
A very underdeveloped place.

1133
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You can move.

1134
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
In fact, to some extent.

1135
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
There is a way.

1136
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Generate more wealth.

1137
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Is to be able to let your.

1138
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Economic capital continues.

1139
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A very important element.

1140
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Then here again.

1141
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Back to what I just said.

1142
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In fact, some people may want to.

1143
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Come back and do business.

1144
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
What.

1145
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Some people do it.

1146
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Tourism industry.

1147
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But their tourism industry is.

1148
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
There is an empty environment.

1149
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's very underdeveloped.

1150
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's not easy to go to Tokyo.

1151
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There are only three places to fly.

1152
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
One is from Australia.

1153
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Darwin.

1154
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Darwin is a base.

1155
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It was a military base before.

1156
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That place.

1157
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And only Australia Airlines.

1158
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Qantas Air North.

1159
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Next is from Singapore.

1160
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The last one is from Bali.

1161
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Bali is actually the most.

1162
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Most people fly.

1163
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Then I flew directly from Australia.

1164
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Then come back to Bali.

1165
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So the plane.

1166
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's not easy to fly.

1167
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Very few tourists come.

1168
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That is.

1169
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Domestic tourists.

1170
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's not enough to support this.

1171
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So they.

1172
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The official has been telling me.

1173
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Can you write an article about tourism?

1174
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let more people come.

1175
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I just want to say.

1176
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But it's not like that.

1177
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The West will want to go to Tokyo.

1178
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The feeling of spending money.

1179
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's a big adventure.

1180
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That kind of feeling.

1181
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because they are actually like.

1182
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Many areas in Southeast Asia.

1183
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Fighters are banned.

1184
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We know that Indonesia is actually a.

1185
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Go home country.

1186
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
In addition to the fighters in Bali.

1187
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Other places will call the mayor.

1188
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But the fighters in Tokyo.

1189
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Basically every day.

1190
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
That's their rule.

1191
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The rule is.

1192
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'll have a video later.

1193
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
The chicken will become.

1194
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Dinner that day.

1195
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
If you win the chicken.

1196
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because they're in the chicken's leg.

1197
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Remember the chicken's leg.

1198
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
A knife.

1199
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So if you lose, it becomes dinner.

1200
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Then if you win, you can.

1201
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Survive and then tomorrow.

1202
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Continue the next round tomorrow.

1203
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So a lot of people are actually.

1204
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
In.

1205
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Get those things back.

1206
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
In addition to doing these meaningful things.

1207
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
A lot of people actually use it to gamble.

1208
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Or do something.

1209
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Make you happy.

1210
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Spend.

1211
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But every time I'm with the West.

1212
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'll say this.

1213
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This is like our Melbourne car.

1214
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Go to SEMA.

1215
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You go to a bar or something.

1216
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But this is the local version.

1217
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's take a look.

1218
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Fighters.

1219
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Wait a minute.

1220
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So let's take a look at the Fighters.

1221
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Wait a minute.

1222
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That's what I put on the left.

1223
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's a bucket shower.

1224
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I was in the east.

1225
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Ask how to take a shower.

1226
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
This is a bucket shower.

1227
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Fighters.

1228
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Wait a minute.

1229
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Wait a minute.

1230
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Wait a minute.

1231
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Wait a minute.

1232
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Wait a minute.

1233
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Let's talk about it.

1234
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Let's talk about it.

1235
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes.

1236
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
There was a chicken.

1237
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
A little accidentally picked.

1238
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And then the chicken was left to the side for dinner.

1239
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I was on the left picture.

1240
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I am our sponsor.

1241
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Come back he opened the ghost.

1242
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Really like Taiwan 450 years ago.

1243
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You are just in that window that man.

1244
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And tell the old lady.

1245
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Hey, what I want?

1246
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Hey, I asked my woman that person bought something.

1247
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
She said she bought a bottle of gutebebe chili sauce and a envelope.

1248
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So they are basically that kind of small particlularly.

1249
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's like this.

1250
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The whole thing on the top is the shampoo.

1251
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Because they actually only have to go on a date.

1252
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
When is it?

1253
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
When do you wash your hair with shampoo?

1254
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's why they usually take a shower.

1255
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I just use cold water.

1256
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So when you wash your hair, you use a small bag.

1257
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And then because I'm a foreigner.

1258
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So sometimes I go to visit our OZ corner.

1259
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We have an Australian supermarket.

1260
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
See if we can buy Australian milk.

1261
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Then we'll see.

1262
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
These are our little friends.

1263
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This is their daily game.

1264
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And then I just put some.

1265
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I wrote some articles myself.

1266
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
If you are interested.

1267
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And the Australian ABC has interviewed me.

1268
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Chinese experience.

1269
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
If you are interested, you can take a look.

1270
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Wow!

1271
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The black one next to it is a pig.

1272
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Their pigs are pretty thin.

1273
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Because people can't eat enough.

1274
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So the pigs are also very thin.

1275
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah.

1276
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So that's about what I wanted to share today.

1277
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
If you have any questions.

1278
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You are welcome to discuss it together.

1279
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Thank you everyone.

1280
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Thank you.

1281
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Annie's speech was really, really exciting.

1282
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I really think it's very, very interesting.

1283
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Then I want to ask.

1284
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
If the audience has any questions.

1285
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You can ask them at this time.

1286
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Then.

1287
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Or this is good.

1288
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Because our speech is almost.

1289
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I can stop recording first.

1290
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Then everyone can be more free.

1291
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
If you want to ask questions, you can.

1292
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
If you are here, thank you again.

1293
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Annie's speech today.

1294
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Thank you.
