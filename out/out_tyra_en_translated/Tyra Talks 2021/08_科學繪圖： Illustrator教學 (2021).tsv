0	19460	Hello everyone, welcome to today's lecture on July 31st, Project HIRA. Today is a special event in the summer, and we would like to invite Professor Tu-Ming Feng, who is now at the University of Westlake.
19460	34460	His main research focuses on the theory of quantum physics. He is interested in low-dimensional materials, transport phenomena, and the topological phase of matter.
34460	48460	Although he is a theorist, he also likes to cooperate with experimentalists to realize his theories.
48460	65460	Another important thing is that he is also very interested in scientific education, so he hopes that today's lecture can bring us some gains.
65460	71460	Today's lecture is mainly about the teaching of the scientific diagram and Illustrator.
71460	83460	I hope that in this lecture, we can learn the importance of the scientific diagram, the thinking process, and how to use Illustrator.
83460	89460	Let's give Professor Tu-Ming Feng the floor.
89460	103460	Hello everyone, this is my first time to give a lecture on Project HIRA, so please bear with me if there are any lags.
104460	114460	Today, I will talk about the scientific diagram and how to use Illustrator to realize the scientific diagram.
114460	131460	The scientific diagram is a very big topic, so I will talk about it in detail, but I will try to make it easy for you to understand.
131460	133460	Illustrator is a bigger topic.
134460	144460	At that time, I studied Illustrator for about two months, and I studied two nights a week and three hours a night.
144460	153460	At that time, I studied Illustrator in a classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional class for advertising students.
154460	162460	At that time, I studied Illustrator in a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University, which is a very professional classroom opposite Taiwan University.
162460	166460	Basically, you take a picture and use Illustrator to copy it completely.
166460	169460	So we do this kind of practice every week.
169460	173460	We will practice from a small lamp to an apple.
173460	179460	But when I was studying for my Ph.D., I had to draw a lot of pictures.
179460	191460	Especially when I did a lot of scientific education, I had to talk to the general public about some difficult quantum problems or some difficult physics problems.
191460	196460	At this time, you have to draw a good picture to help them.
196460	202460	But this kind of picture only needs some basic functions of Illustrator.
202460	204460	You don't need advanced functions.
204460	208460	So today I will introduce these basic functions and help you get started.
208460	211460	At the end, I will give you some videos.
211460	219460	If you practice according to these videos, you will probably understand how to use Illustrator by drawing five to ten pictures.
219460	222460	Then you can move on from there.
223460	229460	If you have any questions later, you can leave a message in the chat.
230460	233460	So this is my routine today.
235460	240460	I want to tell you first that the science team is very subjective.
240460	243460	Some people think this picture is beautiful, some people think that picture is beautiful.
243460	247460	What I'm talking about today is mainly my subjective opinion and experience.
247460	257460	It's also my experience of helping people change articles for so many years.
257460	260460	So if you have a different idea, you are welcome to leave it in the comments.
260460	263460	I'm sure a lot of people have the same opinion as you.
265460	267460	Okay, the concept of scientific drawing.
269460	273460	When we start talking about the concept of scientific drawing, I need you to start imagining.
273460	279460	How do you draw a picture based on your recent article or article you just wrote?
282460	287460	Usually, as a scientist, you start with a PhD.
287460	289460	First, you will do a lot of research.
289460	293460	After the research, you may write a paper.
293460	296460	After writing the paper, you have to give a speech everywhere.
296460	302460	So when you want to present to others, you mainly write articles and give speeches.
302460	305460	The purpose of these two parts is also very different.
305460	311460	But whether it's an article or a speech, it basically has some components.
311460	314460	That is, there are words, pictures, and charts.
319460	322460	But every article has words, pictures, and charts.
322460	325460	But what kind of scientific article do you think is good to read?
325460	329460	I believe when you read other people's literature, you read other people's papers.
329460	331460	So sometimes you think, why is this article so difficult to read?
331460	334460	Why did I read this paragraph 10 times and still not understand it?
334460	336460	Or why when I went to listen to the slideshow,
336460	342460	there were people who did experiments for 20 minutes and showed you 100 slides.
342460	345460	Then you don't understand what the slides are talking about.
345460	349460	So sometimes you think a certain article is particularly difficult to read, particularly difficult to understand.
349460	354460	Or some slideshows, some presentations, you may fall asleep after 10 minutes.
354460	359460	This kind of thing means that this article or this is not necessarily your problem.
359460	363460	But a lot of times, this presenter or this author,
363460	367460	his article or his slideshow is a bit problematic.
367460	371460	So his slideshow or this article is not so easy to read.
371460	375460	So what is a good scientific article?
375460	377460	There are basically four concepts.
377460	381460	I'll give you a lot of examples of these four concepts later.
381460	384460	Let you understand what these four concepts mean.
384460	386460	Because I've been talking about this for a long time.
386460	390460	Okay, first of all, this article has to be very clear.
390460	393460	You're writing a scientific article.
393460	395460	What is my experiment?
395460	396460	What is my method?
396460	398460	And how did I do it?
398460	399460	What is my final result?
399460	401460	What does this result mean?
401460	403460	And what does that mean?
403460	405460	And how do I get from this meaning?
405460	407460	Go down and do more discussion.
407460	410460	It should be a very clear, very clear thing.
410460	412460	What about your English sentence?
412460	414460	We usually hope it's a simple sentence.
414460	417460	You don't want to use too many complicated sentences.
417460	419460	And then there's a lot, a lot of words.
419460	420460	That's not good.
420460	423460	The simplest thing is that you have to be very clear.
423460	427460	Write down the whole story of the fact you're doing research.
427460	428460	What about this story?
428460	430460	In addition to writing it down very clearly,
430460	435460	You have to have a very, very strict logic between each component.
435460	437460	That's why this one is going to take this paragraph.
437460	441460	There should be a reason for this.
442460	444460	So when you write an article,
444460	447460	It's not going to make people think, oh, I said A, and then I said B.
447460	449460	But there's a jump between A and B.
449460	450460	I don't know why I'm talking about B.
450460	451460	I don't know what A is.
451460	452460	Transition to B.
452460	453460	I'll just say A and B.
453460	454460	That's not good.
454460	458460	This is what you see a lot in a lot of presentations.
458460	461460	The third one is precise.
461460	464460	What kind of experiment are you telling people?
464460	467460	If it's a paper, if it's a presentation,
467460	469460	You can talk very long and wait for people to ask questions.
469460	472460	But if you're a paper, you have to make it very clear.
472460	475460	For example, what are some of your control variables?
475460	477460	What temperature are you doing?
477460	480460	You just have to find a corner in the paper.
480460	482460	It's all about the narrative.
482460	483460	It's all very precise.
483460	485460	What about your inference?
485460	488460	You have to be very, very precise with your words, especially your verbs.
488460	491460	For example, this thing is what I guess.
491460	493460	Or is this thing going to be like this?
493460	496460	Is this cause and effect relationship very absolute?
496460	499460	Or is it 80%?
499460	501460	Is it possible to have a relationship?
501460	502460	Maybe it doesn't matter.
502460	504460	Or is this completely my guess?
504460	506460	This kind of verb theory,
506460	509460	You have to be very precise with your words.
509460	512460	Okay, and then the fourth one.
512460	514460	The important thing is that this article is easy to read.
514460	517460	You can write it very clearly, very precise.
517460	519460	But sometimes it's just not that easy to read.
519460	522460	Or people don't want to read the first time they see it.
522460	524460	For example, some articles are very well written,
525460	527460	Then people don't want to read it.
527460	531460	So you still have to readability.
531460	536460	The first three are basically the skills you have to tell the story.
536460	539460	This is another topic.
539460	541460	What about the picture?
541460	544460	The main thing is to strengthen the readability.
544460	545460	It's beautiful and easy to read.
545460	547460	This is the biggest use of the picture.
547460	549460	So every time you draw a picture,
549460	553460	This picture must add points to your article.
553460	556460	The bonus part is that it makes people feel attractive and want to read it.
556460	559460	Then you can use very clear materials.
559460	561460	What are you studying?
566460	568460	So let's take a look.
568460	570460	A good scientific article or video.
570460	575460	What kind of pictures do you think will be helpful to the audience?
575460	585460	Then I'll try it.
585460	588460	You can all use the speech function, right?
588460	591460	I want you to give me some examples.
591460	599460	What kind of pictures do you choose to put on your paper?
599460	602460	Any ideas?
602460	605460	Let's ask for three volunteers.
612460	614460	Let's check if everyone is listening.
614460	619460	Do you want to talk about it first?
619460	621460	Me?
621460	627460	I think it's important to have a process.
627460	629460	There's a process, right?
630460	632460	Or push down the process.
636460	638460	Like a process diagram.
641460	647460	I think my first picture will be
647460	649460	In my experiment,
649460	653460	It's a more innovative part.
653460	658460	It's a more innovative part.
658460	660460	Enlarge it and put it there.
660460	664460	Then the second one is the entire experimental framework.
664460	667460	It's innovative, right?
667460	670460	And then put an experimental framework or process diagram.
670460	672460	And then the last one is the data.
672460	674460	The last one is the data.
674460	679460	Anyone else want to add?
679460	681460	We already have three.
684460	685460	Okay.
685460	688460	Today we're talking about these three pictures, right?
688460	691460	I'm going to talk about exactly these three pictures today.
691460	693460	It's a process diagram.
693460	696460	Because we just talked about simple and easy to understand.
696460	698460	Or beautiful and easy to understand.
698460	700460	What is readability?
700460	702460	Readability is that you want people to want to read.
702460	705460	So we're going to have an innovative picture.
705460	709460	What's the most innovative and different idea in your experiment?
709460	711460	This picture is usually very beautiful.
711460	712460	And then put it on the first page.
712460	714460	Because if you make this picture beautiful and put it on the first page,
714460	716460	It's easy to be selected as the cover of the magazine.
716460	717460	Okay.
717460	721460	So this innovative picture is not the same as your other data pictures.
721460	722460	I'll show you later.
722460	723460	What is an innovative picture?
723460	725460	And then the second one is.
725460	731460	Almost doing experiments or doing a lot of social studies.
731460	733460	Or the theory will have a process diagram.
733460	735460	How do you do this experiment?
735460	737460	How is your instrument exactly layered?
737460	739460	So this is how we have a process diagram.
740460	743460	The process diagram will make it easy for people to understand.
743460	745460	Because if you want to describe your instrument,
745460	747460	But if you use all the text, you'll say,
747460	751460	Okay, I'm going to put A material on top of this material.
751460	756460	C material, B material, C material, 9 cm, D material, 10 cm.
756460	760460	If you're using text, you might have to be naked.
760460	762460	I just said that for a whole page.
762460	764460	You can't describe an instrument well.
764460	767460	But you just need to put a little picture.
767460	770460	He can put everything you just said on top of it.
770460	772460	This is the most powerful part of the picture.
772460	776460	So you think if you talk about a page of things, you can use a picture to replace it.
776460	778460	You have to change that picture.
778460	780460	Even if there's no data in that picture.
780460	782460	But he can replace so many words.
782460	783460	It's worth being put on.
783460	785460	So this is the process diagram.
785460	786460	Okay.
786460	788460	But if you can finish your process in one sentence,
788460	790460	You don't need to put this picture on.
790460	792460	Because it's a waste of space.
792460	794460	And then the last one is the data picture.
794460	796460	You may have been doing experiments for several years.
796460	798460	The most important thing is the data, right?
798460	800460	So we're going to put the data picture in there, too.
800460	803460	So the data picture should be more straightforward.
803460	807460	Okay, so we're going to talk about these three.
811460	815460	So let's take a look at the scientific picture.
815460	817460	Of course, I can tell you what kind of picture it is.
817460	820460	Basically, it's a good picture.
820460	822460	So what kind of picture is a good picture?
822460	824460	What kind of picture is a bad picture?
825460	829460	Let's take a look at it first.
829460	831460	What do you think of this picture?
834460	838460	Let's say this is the current situation of Kobe.
838460	840460	And then some people are not infected.
840460	842460	There are so many people who are not infected.
842460	844460	And then some people are infected with no symptoms.
844460	846460	Some people are infected with symptoms.
846460	848460	Let's criticize this picture.
848460	852460	From the criticism, you can slowly increase your beauty.
852460	857460	What do you think is the biggest problem with this picture?
859460	861460	There are too few people who are infected.
861460	864460	There are too few people who are infected with symptoms.
864460	866460	You can't see it on the picture.
866460	869460	Yeah, you can barely see this, right?
869460	871460	So you can barely see this picture.
871460	873460	What's the purpose of this picture?
873460	875460	I want people to compare and see how much this is.
875460	877460	But this is so little.
877460	879460	This original picture is a failure.
879460	881460	You just can't see it.
881460	884460	Let me talk about some suggestions in the chat.
884460	887460	He said there is no main title.
887460	891460	Does that mean there is no title?
891460	893460	No title.
893460	896460	And Ray said there is no value.
896460	899460	No value, that's right.
899460	901460	And Chi-Chi said...
901460	903460	I'm sorry.
903460	905460	It's ugly. Why do you want an original picture?
905460	907460	You can just use this one.
912460	914460	Okay.
914460	916460	So everyone can see the point, right?
916460	918460	This picture doesn't have any bonus points.
918460	920460	This picture only contains three pieces of information.
920460	924460	Basically, I don't know how many people are infected.
924460	927460	And we don't know their numbers.
927460	930460	So basically, this picture tells us only one piece of information.
930460	932460	There are a lot of people who are not infected.
932460	933460	That's it.
933460	936460	And the sentence I just said can literally be used in one sentence.
936460	938460	One sentence is the end.
938460	942460	Why do I have to spend so much time to say one sentence to end it?
942460	944460	So it's not necessary.
944460	946460	This picture can be removed.
946460	948460	I can just write one sentence.
948460	950460	80% of people are not infected.
950460	954460	15% of people are not infected.
954460	956460	I can just finish this sentence.
956460	958460	So the biggest problem with this picture is that
958460	962460	in addition to not precise and no bonus points,
962460	964460	it shouldn't exist at all.
964460	967460	This is a picture I made up.
967460	969460	But the biggest problem with this picture is that
969460	971460	it shouldn't exist at all.
971460	973460	It doesn't make sense at all.
973460	974460	OK.
974460	977460	So everyone actually has some aesthetics.
977460	980460	Let's take a look at this picture.
980460	983460	What do you think is wrong with this picture?
993460	996460	You can also write it in the chat.
997460	998460	OK.
998460	1000460	William said the font is too small.
1000460	1002460	The font is too small.
1002460	1003460	That's right.
1003460	1006460	Usually, very experienced scientists
1006460	1008460	will know the font size
1008460	1011460	as soon as they see the article.
1011460	1013460	Then they will know that the font is too small.
1015460	1018460	It doesn't mark what each line is.
1018460	1021460	What is the line of different shapes?
1021460	1022460	What is it?
1022460	1023460	That's right.
1023460	1025460	It doesn't have a legend at all, does it?
1025460	1026460	That's right.
1027460	1028460	OK.
1028460	1032460	Did you find that the picture below looks empty?
1032460	1034460	But there is actually data below.
1034460	1036460	This data is just very close to zero.
1036460	1037460	Oh.
1038460	1039460	Did you find that?
1042460	1043460	Yes, like this picture,
1043460	1044460	you either make it log,
1044460	1046460	that is, semi-log 2,
1046460	1049460	or you have to zoom out as much as possible.
1049460	1050460	If it's all zero,
1050460	1051460	you don't have to draw at all.
1051460	1052460	Just write it all as zero.
1052460	1053460	That's it.
1054460	1056460	Yes, everyone has started to catch a point.
1058460	1059460	Of course, we will...
1059460	1061460	I usually...
1061460	1062460	You'll know later.
1062460	1064460	I'll tell you more in detail later.
1064460	1068460	For example, this triangle is too small.
1068460	1071460	It's too small compared to this one.
1072460	1073460	And then this title.
1073460	1075460	This is the X, Y axis.
1075460	1078460	We usually use text.
1078460	1082460	Try to avoid using delta P or T.
1082460	1083460	Try not to use symbols.
1083460	1085460	Try to use good things.
1086460	1087460	OK.
1088460	1089460	This picture...
1089460	1090460	Every picture I'm showing now
1090460	1092460	can be found on paper.
1092460	1094460	These are all already published papers.
1095460	1098460	This is also a paper that has already been published.
1098460	1102460	What do you think of this picture?
1107460	1109460	Is it not necessary to be three-dimensional?
1109460	1112460	Does it want to be three-dimensional?
1113460	1114460	That's right.
1114460	1116460	Once upon a time,
1116460	1118460	when people just started to draw three-dimensional pictures,
1118460	1119460	they thought it was cool.
1119460	1121460	So they wanted to draw three-dimensional pictures of everything.
1121460	1122460	Especially the round cake picture.
1122460	1123460	Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.
1124460	1125460	Then the tree-shaped picture.
1125460	1126460	Then this kind of picture.
1126460	1127460	Everyone likes to draw three-dimensional pictures.
1129460	1130460	But you see, this three-dimensional picture
1130460	1131460	has no extra points at all.
1131460	1132460	And it's very ugly.
1134460	1136460	So everyone must master a trick when drawing pictures.
1136460	1139460	You have to draw a picture in a simple way.
1139460	1141460	This is the best way for everyone to understand.
1142460	1143460	If you draw a 3D picture,
1143460	1145460	it often has no extra points.
1146460	1147460	Even if it's a round cake picture,
1147460	1149460	we also want it to be a two-dimensional round cake picture.
1149460	1150460	We don't want it to be a three-dimensional round cake picture.
1150460	1152460	You can be a very beautiful two-dimensional picture.
1152460	1154460	That's better than a three-dimensional picture.
1155460	1156460	Because the three-dimensional picture will be a bit oblique.
1156460	1160460	So it's hard to compare the size of each sector.
1161460	1163460	Then this three-dimensional picture is even more exaggerated.
1164460	1165460	It's uglier.
1167460	1170460	This picture, as you can see, is very strange.
1170460	1172460	This picture has no data points at all.
1174460	1177460	And it's empty.
1177460	1181460	This picture is very, very empty.
1181460	1183460	Then there is no data point.
1183460	1186460	It looks like a picture with very little information.
1186460	1187460	This picture either needs to be removed.
1187460	1189460	Otherwise, you have to add more data.
1189460	1191460	Or add more information.
1191460	1192460	This picture is too empty.
1196460	1197460	What about this picture?
1197460	1200460	Let's see if you can see it.
1200460	1203460	Where is the problem with this picture?
1206460	1211460	This is also a picture that I often see in my students' reports.
1224460	1225460	I can't see where the problem is.
1225460	1227460	But I don't know what this picture is talking about.
1231460	1237460	This picture is more professional.
1237460	1241460	The biggest problem with this picture is the error bar.
1244460	1248460	The error bar should be visible from top to bottom.
1248460	1249460	Especially the black one.
1249460	1251460	Can you see these two sides?
1251460	1254460	You can hardly see these four black errors.
1256460	1259460	Then William said the unit.
1261460	1263460	Yes, there is no unit.
1263460	1265460	They didn't tell you how high this is.
1265460	1266460	What does it mean to be high?
1266460	1268460	And what is the unit of this activity?
1268460	1270460	This is also a very good point.
1273460	1277460	So this error bar is a lot of experiments.
1277460	1279460	Especially social science.
1279460	1281460	It's a lot of experiments.
1281460	1282460	There was originally an error bar.
1282460	1284460	You shouldn't go up.
1284460	1286460	Because you want to talk about two things.
1286460	1287460	What does it have to do with?
1287460	1289460	Or you have to compare two things.
1289460	1290460	One is high, one is low.
1290460	1291460	You have to call the error bar.
1291460	1293460	You can make an effective comparison.
1293460	1295460	So the error bar is what people do most often.
1295460	1297460	The point where the tree map is forgotten.
1298460	1300460	Then the error bar must be very clear.
1300460	1301460	Be sure to come out.
1301460	1302460	Don't use it like this.
1302460	1304460	You can't even see it in black.
1305460	1307460	This is a similar problem we just talked about.
1307460	1309460	It's a tasteless 3D.
1309460	1310460	Look at this 3D.
1310460	1311460	There is no bonus.
1311460	1312460	There is no bonus at all.
1312460	1313460	Below this is even worse.
1318460	1320460	So we've seen a few pictures now.
1320460	1321460	Everyone has an opinion.
1321460	1324460	Everyone probably knows how ugly the scientific map is.
1324460	1326460	When you're drawing.
1326460	1327460	When you finish the picture.
1327460	1328460	You have to ask yourself.
1328460	1329460	Is your picture so ugly?
1329460	1331460	And then if you think it's ugly.
1331460	1332460	You have to improve it a little bit.
1332460	1334460	How can it be more beautiful?
1334460	1335460	Is there enough information?
1336460	1337460	OK.
1337460	1338460	There's another big problem.
1338460	1339460	Some pictures.
1339460	1341460	After it's done.
1341460	1343460	It's just that when you zoom in, it's a little bit of a blur.
1346460	1348460	So this kind of blurred picture.
1348460	1349460	We'll try to avoid it.
1349460	1351460	Because a lot of people now.
1351460	1353460	Some people may want to look at the details.
1353460	1354460	I want to zoom in as much as I can.
1354460	1355460	If you blur it.
1355460	1357460	It's hard for people to look at the details.
1357460	1358460	So we want all the pictures.
1358460	1360460	Try to use the amount of pictures.
1360460	1361460	But this is not absolute.
1362460	1364460	I can only say that 80 to 90 percent of the pictures.
1364460	1366460	It could be the amount of pictures.
1366460	1367460	But.
1368460	1369460	There are still a lot of pictures.
1369460	1371460	They can't make the amount of pictures.
1371460	1372460	For example, like this picture.
1372460	1374460	For example, you take your experiment.
1374460	1375460	Oh, that picture.
1375460	1377460	You can't make the amount of pictures.
1377460	1378460	You have to.
1378460	1380460	It is what it is.
1380460	1381460	You have to put it on like this.
1381460	1383460	So you put these pictures in.
1383460	1384460	It's okay, too.
1384460	1386460	You just have to make sure it's high enough.
1386460	1388460	It's more than 300 dpi.
1388460	1389460	OK.
1390460	1393460	That's the best thing about illustrator.
1393460	1395460	It can make all your ideas.
1395460	1396460	The amount of pictures.
1398460	1399460	So.
1399460	1401460	Go to the data visualization.
1401460	1403460	It's just that he has some of these.
1403460	1405460	It's basically.
1405460	1406460	You have a data.
1406460	1408460	You have to think about this data first.
1408460	1410460	What story do you want to tell?
1410460	1413460	And then how do you get this data to attract people?
1413460	1415460	It's you.
1415460	1417460	Um, I'm basically a little outlier.
1417460	1419460	But these are the ones we just talked about.
1419460	1420460	It's this data.
1420460	1422460	He must love it.
1422460	1424460	It looks beautiful and interesting.
1424460	1426460	Or a very amazing fact.
1426460	1428460	Or a very innovative idea.
1428460	1429460	Or this data.
1429460	1432460	To be able to tell you what the experiment I did is.
1432460	1434460	Show it to you very clearly.
1434460	1436460	OK.
1436460	1437460	Uh, or.
1437460	1439460	Some people will put some innovative pictures.
1439460	1441460	Or some.
1441460	1443460	Pictures that attract people's attention.
1443460	1444460	Right?
1444460	1447460	These pictures can reinforce some arguments or opinions.
1447460	1449460	For example, I'm going to talk about a point of view later.
1449460	1451460	Uh, that point of view.
1451460	1453460	I might need a picture to support it.
1453460	1455460	This picture is not necessarily my data picture.
1455460	1456460	It's not necessarily my intention.
1456460	1458460	But I can draw a process picture.
1458460	1460460	Or go and talk about my more.
1460460	1462460	More, uh, more profound.
1462460	1464460	A more powerful one.
1464460	1465460	A point of view.
1465460	1466460	OK.
1466460	1468460	So these are all things you might be able to put on the map.
1468460	1470460	It's just that you're going to put it on the map.
1471460	1473460	But this is a very good example.
1473460	1476460	It's just that NASA is making a beautiful picture.
1476460	1477460	It's still very good.
1477460	1479460	Look at how beautiful this picture is.
1479460	1481460	I'm not in this field at all.
1481460	1484460	But when I look at this picture, I know what it's talking about.
1484460	1488460	He's talking about the carbon dioxide level before us.
1488460	1490460	It's been fluctuating all the time.
1490460	1493460	But it's about less than 100 years from us.
1493460	1495460	He just rushed up like this.
1495460	1497460	So what's the conclusion of this picture?
1497460	1499460	It's about the million years.
1499460	1503460	It's about the carbon dioxide of our atmosphere that's never been above this line.
1503460	1504460	Boom.
1504460	1505460	This picture.
1505460	1507460	Just how clear it is.
1507460	1508460	He has data.
1508460	1509460	And then.
1509460	1512460	It just tells you.
1512460	1516460	It's just that you don't need to read a single article after you've read it.
1516460	1517460	You know what it's about.
1517460	1519460	This is a great picture.
1519460	1521460	It's a picture that's perfect for the presentation.
1521460	1526460	Or if your article is to be published in a magazine or in a school.
1526460	1529460	This is a picture of what you're going to put in those places.
1529460	1531460	And you just need to put this picture in.
1531460	1533460	Yeah, well, look at the background. It's beautiful, too.
1533460	1536460	It's the background of the earth and the outer space.
1536460	1538460	The background of the atmosphere.
1538460	1540460	It's just that it makes you think.
1540460	1543460	OK.
1543460	1547460	So, like this picture, it's a very good, very good picture.
1547460	1551460	This picture is also very good.
1551460	1553460	This is the year.
1553460	1554460	This is the year.
1554460	1558460	And then the center axis is the solar radiation on the left.
1558460	1561460	The temperature is on the right.
1561460	1564460	And then you look at it and it's got an average value.
1564460	1566460	The average value of 11 years.
1566460	1568460	It's got this one in the hospital.
1568460	1571460	It's very clear at a glance.
1571460	1572460	Right?
1572460	1577460	And then he's got, uh, he's got his, uh, uh, unit, like this.
1578460	1581460	And then this picture, uh, there's one more thing that's worth it.
1581460	1587460	What everyone likes is his, uh, the temperature is red.
1587460	1591460	And then this solar radiation is yellow.
1591460	1593460	It's the temperature. You'll feel hot.
1593460	1595460	So you'll instinctively use red.
1595460	1598460	And then the solar radiation is yellow because it's like the sun.
1598460	1599460	So I'm going to use yellow.
1599460	1602460	So, you know, when you're choosing colors, you're going to be able to choose colors.
1602460	1606460	The easier it is for the reader to think about it, the better it is.
1606460	1608460	And then you look at these two pictures.
1608460	1611460	These beautiful pictures are usually black background, right?
1611460	1613460	This kind of black background picture, you don't usually put it on paper.
1613460	1615460	But I like it very much.
1615460	1616460	Because it's just easy to catch.
1616460	1617460	It's just catching.
1617460	1618460	It's your audience's attention.
1618460	1622460	It's just that when you see black and then there's a bright one, you're going to want to pay attention to it.
1622460	1625460	It's just that it's psychological.
1625460	1627460	It's just that everyone will be like this.
1627460	1628460	So you're going to see this amazing picture.
1628460	1629460	It's usually black background.
1629460	1631460	And then you're going to think it's cool.
1632460	1634460	So this is a very good example.
1634460	1636460	This is also a very good memory picture.
1636460	1640460	Okay, so this picture looks like it's talking about global warming.
1640460	1644460	But it's just that this is a picture I picked up from the Internet.
1644460	1647460	So it's not that he's a little bit of a realist.
1651460	1653460	So we just talked about these things, right?
1653460	1655460	What I'm talking about above is more like a sense of beauty.
1655460	1657460	It's just that you have to keep writing articles.
1657460	1660460	And then when you're criticized or you criticize someone, you develop a sense of beauty.
1660460	1663460	So what do you actually do when you're writing a paper?
1663460	1666460	Basically, you want to use as little ink as possible.
1666460	1669460	So that the reader can get the most ideas in the shortest time.
1669460	1672460	So you have to try to make your articles as short as possible.
1672460	1675460	So at the beginning, you might be the first one to do it.
1675460	1678460	It's a lot of pictures, a lot of words, a lot of tables.
1678460	1680460	But you have to shorten it as much as you can.
1680460	1682460	So you have to shorten it as much as you can.
1682460	1684460	So you have to shorten it as much as you can.
1685460	1687460	But you have to shorten it as much as you can.
1687460	1688460	It's just two or three articles.
1688460	1690460	It's just that you have to shorten it slowly.
1690460	1692460	And then every time you review it, you have to look at it.
1692460	1695460	Can I use a picture as a substitute for this paragraph?
1695460	1697460	Is this paragraph really necessary?
1697460	1699460	Or can I move on to the next page?
1699460	1702460	So you have to keep reviewing this thing.
1702460	1708460	And then in the end, your very messy ideas will turn into a beautiful paper.
1708460	1710460	It just looks very clean.
1710460	1717460	And then every space, every space in your paper will be used in a huge way.
1720460	1722460	So what's the content?
1722460	1725460	What content do you use to present when you're writing an article?
1725460	1727460	You might start writing when you're writing an article.
1727460	1728460	There are some points.
1728460	1729460	Oh, what's the instrument?
1729460	1731460	You'll make a big bar first.
1731460	1734460	When you're making your big bar, you'll find that this part.
1734460	1737460	I want to make it clear in words, but it's very difficult.
1737460	1739460	I don't know how to make it clear.
1739460	1745460	If your instrument is like the instrument or the experiment, it's usually hard to make it clear, right?
1745460	1747460	That kind of thing that's hard to make clear.
1747460	1751460	You can choose to use a picture as a substitute.
1751460	1754460	For example, the first picture is like this.
1754460	1757460	Or the experiment's instrument picture is like this.
1757460	1759460	But if you have an instrument picture, your instrument is very simple.
1759460	1760460	It's just a layer of shit.
1760460	1761460	Then you don't have to.
1761460	1763460	You just say, oh, I've got a layer of shit.
1763460	1766460	You don't have to draw a shit over there.
1766460	1767460	so
1768460	1773460	It's got to be important, but it's hard to make it clear in words, and then you get a picture.
1773460	1775460	So this is the picture.
1775460	1779460	The second one is an effective and supportive point of view.
1779460	1784460	You have to write your argument when you're writing an article, right?
1784460	1787460	Someone says, I'm measuring this, this, this, and I found something, something.
1787460	1791460	So when you say that, you need something to support your argument.
1791460	1795460	What supports your argument, supporting your argument, is your data and your experiment.
1795460	1799460	How do you get your data and your experiment to support your argument?
1799460	1804460	Basically, you have to tell people your data, but there's a lot of data, a lot of numbers flying around.
1804460	1808460	At this time, you can also take a picture of the experiment.
1808460	1811460	That picture can clearly support your argument.
1811460	1816460	When you first started making the picture, you might have a bunch of different pictures.
1816460	1819460	You have to pick which pictures will be in the article.
1819460	1820460	You just put it up.
1820460	1822460	If you don't talk about it in the article, you don't put it up.
1823460	1825460	Or you don't put it up at all.
1825460	1833460	And then the third one is the third picture, which is what Jason just mentioned.
1833460	1838460	This is an innovative picture, which is what you usually find difficult to make clear.
1838460	1839460	It has your data arguments.
1839460	1841460	This is the only two in the general paper.
1841460	1847460	But when you want to get a better start, or when you want to face a wider audience.
1847460	1850460	And then when your article is very important.
1851460	1856460	You need to have a picture that can quickly make people understand what you're best at.
1856460	1858460	Where's your paper?
1858460	1861460	Is it a quick read of your conclusion or your logic?
1861460	1863460	Or is it your most innovative part?
1863460	1867460	This is an innovative picture.
1870460	1873460	Like the two NASA pictures I just showed you.
1873460	1876460	It's the third one, the innovative picture.
1876460	1879460	It's the innovative picture, or the second one.
1879460	1881460	But it's a library.
1881460	1884460	It has a lot of things and a background.
1884460	1888460	So it's basically a mix of two and three.
1894460	1896460	Like this picture.
1896460	1901460	Even if we're not in the same industry, we can see the conclusion right away.
1901460	1903460	This picture is amazing.
1903460	1906460	This kind of picture usually takes a long time to change.
1907460	1911460	Each font, font, even the color and width have to be changed back and forth.
1911460	1913460	This kind of picture is usually very important.
1915460	1918460	If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat.
1918460	1920460	I'm talking a little fast.
1920460	1923460	If you want me to speak slower, you can talk to me.
1926460	1930460	These three pictures are also pictures on this Nature.
1930460	1932460	The first one is data.
1932460	1934460	The second one is the process.
1934460	1938460	The third one is the most important conclusion.
1938460	1941460	For example, what is a neuron cell?
1941460	1944460	Release to another neuron cell.
1944460	1946460	What are the receptors?
1948460	1950460	This is the conclusion picture.
1950460	1952460	Look at this picture.
1952460	1954460	It's not your process, it's not your data.
1954460	1956460	It's just a story.
1956460	1959460	But this story, you can actually replace it with a couple of words.
1959460	1961460	In the text.
1961460	1963460	But he still chose to draw it.
1963460	1965460	Because this idea is very important.
1965460	1969460	You want the audience to catch this idea.
1969460	1971460	So they draw this picture.
1971460	1973460	Then the whole piece of paper may only put this picture.
1973460	1975460	Or put this picture on the first page.
1979460	1981460	This data picture, Illustrator can help.
1981460	1984460	The second and third are the strengths of Illustrator.
1984460	1988460	Draw this beautiful picture.
1988460	1990460	This is the strength of Illustrator.
1994460	1996460	This is the drawing process.
1996460	1998460	We just talked about it a little bit.
1998460	2000460	Basically, you have to prepare a picture.
2000460	2002460	Prepare a good picture.
2002460	2004460	Ask yourself some questions.
2004460	2007460	I can put the slides up later.
2007460	2010460	Because the content I prepared today is actually more than an hour.
2010460	2013460	So I want to talk about something.
2013460	2015460	I think you might be more interested.
2015460	2018460	But if you want to slow down in some places.
2018460	2022460	If you talk a little more, you can write it in the chat.
2024460	2026460	Then we can go over.
2026460	2028460	Basically, you have to prepare a picture.
2028460	2031460	The idea of ​​a picture is the most important.
2031460	2034460	You make sure what to do with this picture.
2034460	2037460	Then you use the draft draft first.
2037460	2039460	After you are sure to use this picture,
2039460	2042460	The second thing you should do is to study the journal you want to submit.
2042460	2044460	The style of this journal.
2044460	2046460	For example, how big is his file?
2046460	2048460	How big is the font?
2048460	2050460	What font?
2050460	2052460	He might have some regulations.
2052460	2054460	Then you use your data.
2054460	2056460	Because you are using MATLAB, Mathematica, or some data processing programs.
2056460	2058460	Or Excel.
2058460	2061460	When you use them to export, try to follow the standard output.
2061460	2064460	The better you export here.
2064460	2066460	The easier it will be to beautify it in the end.
2066460	2068460	If you export it badly.
2068460	2070460	It may take one or two hours to beautify it.
2070460	2072460	To handle a picture.
2072460	2077460	So when you export, it's best to try to follow the standard output.
2079460	2081460	Then the third is that you get it all done.
2081460	2083460	Then we start to draw.
2083460	2085460	Then we start to beautify.
2085460	2092460	This is the point of beautification.
2092460	2095460	For example, how much font do you want to use?
2095460	2098460	What kind of picture do you want to use?
2098460	2101460	I probably made a list here.
2103460	2105460	How to choose the color?
2105460	2108460	I just made a list here.
2108460	2110460	Does anyone want to go over?
2110460	2112460	Or we can start talking about Illustrator.
2132460	2134460	This table is what I prepared for everyone.
2134460	2136460	This table is what I prepared for everyone.
2137460	2139460	When you export this picture.
2139460	2141460	Try to use the same amount of pictures.
2141460	2143460	There's nothing you can do.
2143460	2145460	If it's too big, just use JP.
2145460	2147460	Just use a normal picture.
2147460	2149460	Try to use the same amount of pictures.
2149460	2151460	Do not mess with the picture.
2151460	2153460	Do not mess with the picture.
2153460	2156460	Then the third is that I think the average person may have not noticed.
2156460	2158460	When do you use the line picture?
2158460	2160460	When do you use the column picture?
2160460	2162460	When do you use the column picture?
2162460	2164460	The line picture is used in.
2164460	2166460	When your X and Y are continuous.
2166460	2168460	Then you have to show people a trend.
2168460	2170460	If you don't want to show people a trend.
2170460	2172460	You just want to compare some of the paper.
2172460	2174460	Don't use the line picture.
2174460	2176460	Don't use a little bit of the line picture.
2176460	2178460	Don't connect it.
2178460	2180460	Don't use a little bit.
2180460	2182460	You have a line picture.
2182460	2184460	You must be able to tell people.
2184460	2186460	This thing grows up.
2186460	2188460	Grow down or have a pit.
2188460	2190460	You must have a thought like this.
2190460	2192460	Then you use the line picture.
2192460	2194460	You have to say.
2194460	2196460	There are so many people without infection.
2196460	2198460	There are so many people with infection.
2198460	2200460	You are a project, a project, a project.
2200460	2202460	This is the column picture.
2202460	2204460	Then the opposite is still.
2204460	2206460	If you want to tell people a trend.
2206460	2208460	You can say I measure this thing.
2208460	2210460	Get one measure.
2210460	2212460	The second one gets two.
2212460	2214460	The third one gets three.
2214460	2216460	I want to show a trend.
2216460	2218460	You may want to say I only measure three points.
2218460	2220460	Can I use the column picture?
2220460	2222460	The column picture will let people naturally.
2222460	2224460	These two things are related to X and Y.
2224460	2226460	But the column picture won't.
2230460	2232460	Then a picture is best to convey one to two concepts.
2232460	2234460	But you have to convey it very clearly.
2234460	2236460	Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.
2236460	2238460	Don't squeeze four or five in a picture.
2238460	2240460	Four or five pictures or four or five concepts.
2240460	2242460	There are too many lines.
2242460	2244460	I don't know what I'm reading.
2244460	2246460	Then the font size.
2246460	2248460	You can adjust it yourself.
2248460	2250460	You can adjust it yourself.
2250460	2252460	Don't use less than 7pt.
2252460	2254460	Don't use less than 7pt.
2254460	2256460	You can't see the printout of the form.
2256460	2258460	You can't see the printout of the form.
2270460	2272460	Then I want to talk about the complete.
2272460	2274460	Some ideas are posed with images.
2274460	2276460	Some ideas are posed with images.
2284460	2286460	Don't burn this thing.
2286460	2287960	Don't burn this thing.
2291960	2293960	It is necessary to have a data.
2293960	2295960	But it's not important enough.
2295960	2297960	But it's not important enough.
2297960	2299960	But it's not important enough.
2300960	2302960	Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.
2302960	2304960	Usually we don't use the data to make another folder.
2304960	2306960	If you really want to show a folder,you can put this into the directory.
2306960	2309960	But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.
2309960	2311960	If you really want to show this big database with a folder.
2311960	2313960	But you don't need to show this big database with a folder.
2313960	2315960	Even if you have been programming better for a few years,
2315960	2318960	people want to give others aさらを
2320960	2322960	Try to detoxify.
2322960	2325960	Humans don't use light yellow or yellow.
2325960	2327960	Don't use light yellow or yellow.
2328960	2330960	The simpler the color, the better.
2330960	2332960	The simpler the color, the better.
2332960	2334960	Red, blue, green are simple colors.
2334960	2336960	If there is only one color to choose, choose blue.
2336960	2338960	After you finish this color,
2338960	2340960	After you finish this color,
2340960	2342960	It's best to print it out with a black and white printer.
2342960	2344960	After printing it out, you may find that
2344960	2346960	Oh, I might have three lines.
2346960	2347960	Oh, I might have three lines.
2347960	2348960	Then I use different colors.
2348960	2351960	Then I use different colors.
2351960	2352960	This is not good.
2352960	2353960	You'd better choose three colors.
2353960	2354960	Then print it out.
2354960	2356960	Then print it out.
2356960	2358960	You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.
2358960	2360960	You can see it clearly even if you print it out with a black and white printer.
2360960	2361960	Or you can just use different colors for data points.
2361960	2363960	Or you can just use different colors for data points.
2363960	2365960	Because some people are red and green blind.
2365960	2367960	So they can't tell the color.
2367960	2369960	So if you don't know the color before you die,
2369960	2371960	You have to use different shapes for data points.
2371960	2373960	So you see a lot of experimental schools
2373960	2375960	What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.
2375960	2377960	What circles, triangles, squares, to distinguish.
2379960	2381960	So if you basically make my outline,
2381960	2383960	So if you basically make my outline,
2383960	2385960	The picture won't be too bad.
2385960	2387960	If you want to make it very beautiful,
2387960	2389960	The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.
2389960	2391960	The easiest way is to refer to the paper you like in the journal.
2391960	2393960	It follows its style.
2393960	2395960	For example, how much size it is, how much you use.
2395960	2397960	For example, how much size it is, how much you use.
2397960	2399960	How thick the line is.
2399960	2401960	I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.
2401960	2403960	I'll share with you some of the sizes I use later.
2403960	2405960	If you like it, you can just take it away.
2409960	2411960	I have a question here.
2411960	2413960	Can I ask?
2413960	2415960	I have a question here.
2415960	2417960	I see a lot of articles
2417960	2419960	And there will be insets in the picture.
2419960	2421960	And there will be insets in the picture.
2421960	2423960	There may be another example in one corner.
2423960	2425960	There may be another example in one corner.
2425960	2427960	Is this picture good?
2427960	2429960	Is this picture good?
2429960	2431960	Is this picture good?
2431960	2433960	Or what is the situation?
2435960	2437960	This is a very good question.
2437960	2439960	Insets are very difficult to draw.
2439960	2441960	Insets are very difficult to draw.
2441960	2443960	Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.
2443960	2445960	Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.
2445960	2447960	Because you like to squeeze your inset to show your face.
2447960	2449960	So the more inset you have, the more space you have.
2449960	2451960	So the more inset you have, the more space you have.
2451960	2453960	So the more inset you have, the more space you have.
2453960	2455960	So let me draw something simple.
2455960	2457960	So let me draw something simple.
2461960	2463960	Okay.
2463960	2465960	I can't go forward so much...
2465960	2467960	What?
2467960	2469960	I can't go forward so much...
2469960	2471960	Did you see it?
2471960	2473960	I didn't see what I was drawing.
2473960	2475960	No.
2475960	2477960	You didn't see it either.
2477960	2479960	I'll try again.
2485960	2489960	I have a picture like this, right?
2489960	2491960	For example, I want to put a picture on this empty space.
2491960	2493960	Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.
2493960	2495960	Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.
2495960	2497960	Then I can put a picture like this, and my line may look like this.
2497960	2499960	If my line looks like this,
2499960	2501960	if my line looks like this,
2501960	2503960	I have a blank space here.
2503960	2505960	I feel, you know,
2505960	2507960	I have something I want to explain.
2507960	2509960	That little thing may not be so important
2509960	2511960	I need to put a picture of myself.
2511960	2513960	I just want to mention it a little bit.
2513960	2515960	I can put it right here.
2515960	2517960	You can use this picture.
2517960	2519960	But if your picture
2519960	2521960	It's not very good, it might look like this.
2521960	2523960	But you still have a small insert,
2523960	2525960	You think it could be added points.
2525960	2527960	What can you do?
2527960	2529960	You can make this picture into a semi-log.
2529960	2531960	You can make it a log.
2531960	2533960	Then this will be squeezed over here.
2533960	2535960	Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.
2535960	2537960	Then you will have a little bit of space to do it.
2537960	2539960	But don't make it too exaggerated.
2539960	2541960	But don't make it too exaggerated.
2541960	2543960	It's a balance.
2543960	2545960	This is a good little trick.
2545960	2547960	This is a good little trick.
2547960	2549960	If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,
2549960	2551960	If you can't squeeze this picture in anyway,
2551960	2553960	If this picture is important to you,
2553960	2555960	You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.
2555960	2557960	You can consider combining this picture with other pictures.
2561960	2563960	I'm not going to box these two pictures.
2563960	2565960	I'm not going to box these two pictures.
2565960	2567960	I'm not going to box these two pictures.
2567960	2569960	I'll delete these two photos.
2569960	2571960	I don't need to box.
2571960	2573960	And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.
2573960	2575960	And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.
2575960	2577960	And then I'll use insert to take the picture out.
2577960	2579960	And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.
2579960	2581960	And then the next picture will be a little bit smaller.
2581960	2583960	But that's not a bad thing.
2583960	2585960	But that's not a bad thing.
2585960	2587960	It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.
2587960	2589960	It's not 50-50, it's possible to be 60-40.
2589960	2591960	It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.
2591960	2593960	It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.
2593960	2595960	It's not too bad because they're 210mm blocks.
2602280	2603960	My teacher read it first.
2606440	2608440	The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.
2608440	2610440	The biggest problem with the inside picture is the size of the font.
2610920	2612920	You use 11 for the X and Y.
2612920	2614920	You use 11 for the X and Y.
2622920	2624920	The convention is 11 for the X and Y.
2624920	2626920	The convention is 11 for the X and Y.
2626920	2628920	It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.
2628920	2630920	It's your tick, 1, 2 ,3, 4.
2630920	2632920	Your tick is a smaller two font.
2632920	2634920	Your tick is a smaller two font.
2634920	2636920	It will become 9.
2636920	2638920	It will become 9.
2639720	2641720	3 is 11, so it's 9.
2649720	2651720	You use 9 for the X and Y.
2651720	2653720	You use 9 for the X and Y.
2653720	2655720	You use 9 for the X and Y.
2656220	2658220	The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
2658220	2660220	the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
2660220	2662220	become 7?
2662220	2664220	Because we follow them.
2664220	2666220	The smallest ones become 7.
2666220	2668220	The smallest ones become 7.
2668220	2670220	So it becomes very crowded
2670220	2672220	because you have to use the smallest font size.
2672220	2674220	Sometimes you may want to explain
2674220	2676220	some things,
2676220	2678220	but you may find that
2678220	2680220	you can't fit in your words.
2680220	2682220	But don't be discouraged.
2682220	2684220	When you do Incept,
2684220	2686220	it's very crowded,
2686220	2688220	so you have to make some space.
2688220	2690220	But with Incept,
2690220	2692220	the numbers inside are already 7.
2692220	2694220	So you have to think about
2694220	2696220	how to make it
2696220	2698220	less crowded.
2698220	2700220	less crowded.
2700220	2702220	Sorry,
2702220	2704220	I just thought of another question.
2704220	2706220	Am I asking too many questions?
2706220	2708220	No, no.
2708220	2710220	When I write articles,
2710220	2712220	I often encounter a problem.
2712220	2714220	For example,
2714220	2716220	the editor may tell me
2716220	2718220	that the order of
2718220	2720220	reference to figure
2720220	2722220	in the article is wrong.
2722220	2724220	For example,
2724220	2726220	I may write
2726220	2728220	and reference figure 1,
2728220	2730220	and then reference figure 2B,
2730220	2732220	and then reference figure 2A,
2732220	2734220	and so on.
2734220	2736220	But sometimes
2736220	2738220	it's just a problem with the layout.
2738220	2740220	I think this layout is better.
2740220	2742220	It's better to show it on the layout.
2742220	2744220	But when you're writing,
2744220	2746220	it's better to show it in another direction.
2746220	2748220	Do you have any suggestions?
2748220	2750220	Okay.
2750220	2752220	This problem
2752220	2754220	is caused by the layout.
2754220	2756220	When you encounter this problem,
2756220	2758220	you may be very reluctant
2758220	2760220	and may not know
2760220	2762220	how to change the layout.
2762220	2764220	Or how to move it
2764220	2766220	to make it better.
2766220	2768220	This problem
2768220	2770220	is caused by the layout.
2770220	2772220	Basically,
2772220	2774220	you have to go back
2774220	2776220	to the first change.
2776220	2778220	Most of the time,
2778220	2780220	you can't make it better.
2780220	2782220	When you start writing,
2782220	2784220	you have to try to avoid this problem.
2784220	2786220	How do you avoid this problem?
2786220	2788220	When you write your article,
2788220	2790220	your logic should be one line.
2790220	2792220	Sometimes,
2792220	2794220	when we write articles,
2794220	2796220	when we write A,
2796220	2798220	we want to talk about B,
2798220	2800220	and we want to talk about C.
2800220	2802220	But if your article is one line,
2802220	2804220	for example,
2804220	2806220	I talk about A to B first,
2806220	2808220	B to C,
2808220	2810220	C to D.
2810220	2812220	Or when I do the experiment,
2812220	2814220	I talk about a point first.
2814220	2816220	I only talk about one material.
2816220	2818220	Then I may talk about another material later.
2818220	2820220	If you do this,
2820220	2822220	you can put all the pictures of this material
2822220	2824220	in a small box.
2824220	2826220	Then you won't have this cross-reference problem.
2828220	2830220	So your problem is
2830220	2832220	the logic of writing.
2832220	2834220	You need to change it at the beginning.
2836220	2838220	If you need to change it at the beginning,
2838220	2840220	you can avoid it later.
2842220	2844220	Thank you for your good question.
2844220	2846220	If you have any questions,
2846220	2848220	you can ask.
2848220	2850220	This is also informal.
2850220	2852220	I hope to help you
2852220	2854220	if you have any questions.
2858220	2860220	Next, I will talk about Illustrator.
2864220	2866220	How many people have used Illustrator?
2870220	2872220	One.
2872220	2874220	Two.
2874220	2876220	Three.
2876220	2878220	Four.
2878220	2880220	Five.
2880220	2882220	Six.
2882220	2884220	Seven.
2884220	2886220	Eight.
2886220	2888220	Nine.
2888220	2890220	Ten.
2890220	2892220	Eleven.
2892220	2894220	Twelve.
2894220	2896220	Thirteen.
2896220	2898220	Fourteen.
2898220	2900220	Fifteen.
2900220	2902220	Sixteen.
2902220	2904220	Illustrator's philosophy
2904220	2906220	is a little different
2906220	2908220	from other software.
2910220	2912220	If you download Illustrator,
2912220	2914220	you will see the interface like this.
2914220	2916220	The middle is your drawing board.
2918220	2920220	On the right,
2924220	2926220	there are tools you often use on the left.
2928220	2930220	For example,
2930220	2932220	you can add text,
2932220	2934220	add a frame,
2934220	2936220	and so on.
2938220	2940220	On the top,
2940220	2942220	after you choose a tool,
2942220	2944220	for example,
2944220	2946220	I choose the first arrow.
2946220	2948220	After I choose the arrow,
2948220	2950220	there will be some tool details on it.
2950220	2952220	This detail will change
2952220	2954220	according to the tool you choose.
2954220	2956220	For example,
2956220	2958220	when I choose the arrow,
2958220	2960220	I will choose a frame.
2960220	2962220	When I choose a frame,
2962220	2964220	I will adjust the thickness of the frame,
2964220	2966220	the color of the frame,
2966220	2968220	the color of the frame,
2968220	2970220	the sharpness of the frame,
2970220	2972220	the roundness of the frame,
2972220	2974220	the style of the frame,
2974220	2976220	or the transparency of the frame.
2976220	2978220	You can basically find it here.
2980220	2982220	If you can't find it,
2982220	2984220	it may have this function.
2984220	2986220	But you have to go to the list
2986220	2988220	and look for it carefully.
2988220	2990220	On the right,
2990220	2992220	there are some advanced tools.
2992220	2994220	The tools on the right
2994220	2996220	are the tools I often use.
2996220	2998220	This one is personalized.
2998220	3000220	Usually, when you get it,
3000220	3002220	there may only be one or two.
3002220	3004220	As you use it for a long time,
3004220	3006220	you can drag the tools you often use
3006220	3008220	to this side.
3008220	3010220	For example,
3010220	3012220	I often use this one for building.
3012220	3014220	Or adjust the line.
3014220	3016220	There are also some colors for drawing.
3016220	3018220	I often put them here.
3018220	3020220	This is an advanced tool list.
3020220	3022220	Okay.
3022220	3024220	There is a question here.
3024220	3026220	Yan is asking
3026220	3028220	in the chat room.
3028220	3030220	Do you recommend any open source software
3030220	3032220	corresponding to Illustrator?
3032220	3034220	No.
3034220	3036220	Because I always use
3036220	3038220	school software.
3040220	3042220	I always use school software.
3042220	3044220	I always use school software.
3044220	3046220	In the chat room,
3046220	3048220	someone mentioned Inkscape.
3048220	3050220	It seems to be an open source software.
3050220	3052220	Someone mentioned
3052220	3054220	that it seems to be
3054220	3056220	the open source of Illustrator.
3056220	3058220	Oh.
3058220	3060220	What is it called?
3060220	3062220	I can see it later.
3062220	3064220	Okay.
3064220	3066220	When you open
3066220	3068220	Illustrator,
3068220	3070220	I think you should talk about its logic first.
3070220	3072220	Then you will know.
3072220	3074220	The logic of Illustrator's drawing
3074220	3076220	is like this.
3076220	3078220	If you have never used this software,
3078220	3080220	you are drawing in
3080220	3082220	Illustrator or
3082220	3084220	Powerpoint.
3084220	3086220	For example,
3086220	3088220	I draw a star.
3088220	3090220	It is a star.
3090220	3092220	You can't do anything
3092220	3094220	to this star.
3094220	3096220	For example,
3096220	3098220	I want this star to have one less corner.
3098220	3100220	But I want this star to be a hexagon.
3100220	3102220	I can't do this.
3102220	3104220	And this star,
3104220	3106220	I might want it not to be so fat.
3106220	3108220	I might want it to be a little thinner.
3108220	3110220	What about this picture?
3110220	3112220	The star on the left
3112220	3114220	doesn't give you any wiggle room.
3114220	3116220	You can't do this.
3116220	3118220	But in Illustrator,
3118220	3120220	when it reads a star,
3120220	3122220	it reads a star like this on the right.
3122220	3124220	Have you ever seen this dot?
3124220	3126220	The square of this entity.
3126220	3128220	This dot is called an anchor.
3128220	3130220	This is a dot.
3130220	3132220	This protruding thing
3132220	3134220	will have a dot.
3134220	3136220	The dot is connected
3136220	3138220	by a straight line.
3138220	3140220	Illustrator reads this picture
3140220	3142220	and it reads a lot of dots.
3142220	3144220	These dots
3144220	3146220	will be connected by a straight line.
3146220	3148220	These dots will be connected by a straight line.
3148220	3150220	These dots will be connected by a straight line.
3150220	3152220	But you may not want these dots,
3152220	3154220	but want a curved line.
3156220	3158220	That's why you-
3158220	3160220	hm.
3160220	3162220	That's why you
3162220	3164220	have these dots.
3164220	3166220	This dot is basically
3166220	3168220	that line doesn't want a straight line.
3168220	3170220	I want it to curve.
3170220	3172220	So when you draw a circle,
3172220	3174220	for example, for a circle not a straight line
3174220	3176220	but a curved line,
3176220	3178220	you can pick up this dot
3178220	3180220	and draw a curve.
3180220	3182220	I'll show you later.
3182220	3184220	At this time,
3184220	3186220	there will be two handles.
3190220	3192220	These handles
3192220	3194220	will control the curve of the line.
3194220	3196220	So you can think about
3196220	3198220	how we usually draw.
3198220	3200220	Basically, it's all this idea.
3200220	3202220	You draw a dot,
3202220	3204220	connect the dots with the lines,
3204220	3206220	and then adjust the curve of the line.
3206220	3208220	Okay.
3208220	3210220	Okay.
3210220	3212220	That's it.
3212220	3214220	Today,
3218220	3220220	we're running out of time.
3222220	3224220	I was going to-
3228220	3230220	There's a lot more, right?
3230220	3232220	Otherwise,
3232220	3234220	I-
3234220	3236220	This is-
3236220	3238220	I found this on the Internet.
3238220	3240220	Basically,
3240220	3242220	I'm going to draw a picture for you to see.
3242220	3244220	And then-
3246220	3248220	Okay.
3248220	3250220	I'm going to draw a picture
3250220	3252220	for you to see.
3252220	3254220	And then,
3254220	3256220	I can give you these tips
3256220	3258220	in PDF format.
3258220	3260220	You can understand it by looking at it directly.
3260220	3262220	For example, how thick the line should be.
3262220	3264220	You can look at it directly.
3264220	3266220	And how to start learning.
3266220	3268220	Okay, no problem.
3272220	3274220	I'll draw a picture for you to see first.
3274220	3276220	This way, you'll have more ideas.
3278220	3280220	Okay.
3280220	3282220	This picture is-
3282220	3284220	I found this picture on the Internet.
3284220	3286220	I drew this picture.
3286220	3288220	It took me about an hour
3288220	3290220	to reproduce this picture.
3290220	3292220	Okay, so look at this picture.
3292220	3294220	If you zoom in, it's a little blurry.
3294220	3296220	And then the next one,
3296220	3298220	I used Illustrator to draw the picture.
3298220	3300220	Look, it's very clear when you zoom in.
3300220	3302220	Okay.
3302220	3304220	So how do I draw these pictures?
3304220	3306220	Okay, let me-
3310220	3312220	Okay.
3316220	3318220	Let me-
3336220	3338220	Let me see how I can
3338220	3340220	zoom in.
3346220	3348220	Okay.
3352220	3354220	Let me-
3354220	3356220	This is what I drew yesterday.
3356220	3358220	Okay.
3358220	3360220	So, look at this picture.
3360220	3362220	I drew it one by one
3362220	3364220	the way I told you.
3364220	3366220	So,
3366220	3368220	in this picture,
3368220	3370220	do you have any-
3370220	3372220	For example,
3372220	3374220	I want to draw this tube.
3374220	3376220	Okay, I want to draw this tube.
3376220	3378220	Two circles plus a bar.
3384220	3386220	How do I draw this picture?
3386220	3388220	Okay, let me think about this picture.
3388220	3390220	This picture is basically two circles plus a bar.
3390220	3392220	So I'm going to draw two circles first.
3396220	3398220	First,
3398220	3400220	I'll- Okay.
3400220	3402220	This is my tool, right?
3402220	3404220	I'm going to choose something.
3404220	3406220	Okay, I'll choose this one.
3406220	3408220	This is a square, right?
3408220	3410220	Okay.
3410220	3412220	So this square,
3412220	3414220	I'm going to click on this square again.
3416220	3418220	Or there's a little triangle below.
3418220	3420220	I don't know if you can see it.
3420220	3422220	Okay, just click on it.
3422220	3424220	My computer is a little slow right now.
3428220	3430220	Okay.
3430220	3432220	And then this picture can-
3432220	3434220	This little tool can tell you,
3434220	3436220	okay, you want to draw a square,
3436220	3438220	but I don't have any other squares to choose from.
3438220	3440220	For example, I have a circle,
3440220	3442220	and then I have this kind of smooth
3442220	3444220	or a star, and so on.
3444220	3446220	Okay, I'm going to choose a circle now.
3446220	3448220	So I'm going to choose a circle now.
3448220	3450220	Is this how I draw it?
3450220	3452220	Okay, so it's hard for me to say
3452220	3454220	that I can draw a real circle, right?
3454220	3456220	I just want to draw a real circle.
3456220	3458220	So how do you draw a real circle?
3458220	3460220	You can press Shift.
3460220	3462220	And then pull.
3462220	3464220	This circle must be a real circle.
3464220	3466220	There are some shortcut keys in Illustrator.
3466220	3468220	These shortcut keys will suggest you to memorize
3468220	3470220	this circle.
3472220	3474220	Okay, so I have a circle now.
3474220	3476220	So I'm going to-
3476220	3478220	I want another circle below,
3478220	3480220	so I'm going to draw another circle.
3482220	3484220	So I drew a circle,
3484220	3486220	and then I want to use a square
3486220	3488220	to connect them together.
3488220	3490220	Right? Okay.
3490220	3492220	Basically, I have this picture.
3492220	3494220	But this picture looks ugly.
3494220	3496220	I want these colors to be right.
3496220	3498220	For example,
3498220	3500220	I want this to be black.
3500220	3502220	What if this is black?
3502220	3504220	What I'm drawing now is this object.
3504220	3506220	Okay, I'm going to choose this black.
3506220	3508220	And then I can choose-
3508220	3510220	You see,
3512220	3514220	this thing,
3514220	3516220	there are some things you can do.
3516220	3518220	The first one is the color inside.
3518220	3520220	I choose black inside.
3520220	3522220	Okay, and then there's no color outside.
3524220	3526220	What about this object?
3526220	3528220	I can also choose black inside.
3528220	3530220	And then there's no color outside.
3532220	3534220	What about this object?
3534220	3536220	I can also choose black inside.
3536220	3538220	There's no color outside.
3538220	3540220	I can also have three boxes
3540220	3542220	and do this thing together.
3542220	3544220	Now I've drawn
3544220	3546220	a tube like this.
3548220	3550220	I want them to be a little bit symmetrical.
3550220	3552220	Because I'm just drawing a circle
3552220	3554220	and then I'm drawing a bar inside.
3554220	3556220	It might not be very symmetrical.
3556220	3558220	We might want it to look better.
3558220	3560220	When you think about this thing,
3560220	3562220	Illustrator does a very intuitive job.
3562220	3564220	You just pick these three things up
3564220	3566220	and look at what you can do
3566220	3568220	with this object on top.
3568220	3570220	You'll see Align on top.
3570220	3572220	How do you align it?
3572220	3574220	You want to have two objects
3574220	3576220	aligned in the middle.
3576220	3578220	You can align it like this.
3578220	3580220	Now these three things are
3580220	3582220	beautifully aligned together.
3582220	3584220	I'm going to add text on top later,
3584220	3586220	so I want these three things
3586220	3588220	to be connected together.
3590220	3592220	I want these three objects
3592220	3594220	to be connected into one object.
3594220	3596220	If I want to do this,
3596220	3598220	I can come here and choose
3598220	3600220	Reshape Builder.
3600220	3602220	It reshapes your object.
3602220	3604220	I'm going to click on this.
3604220	3606220	I'm going to move the cursor
3606220	3608220	to the first one and then move it down.
3608220	3610220	Look, the first one and the second one
3610220	3612220	are merged together.
3612220	3614220	The third one is merged together.
3614220	3616220	The fourth one is merged together.
3616220	3618220	The fifth one is merged together.
3618220	3620220	When I let go,
3620220	3622220	this whole thing becomes an object.
3622220	3624220	I'm not going to draw a circle
3624220	3626220	and then the shape of the circle
3626220	3628220	becomes exactly the same.
3630220	3632220	I'm going to choose a color.
3632220	3634220	I'm going to choose this color.
3636220	3638220	This color is ugly.
3644220	3646220	Now I can choose this object.
3650220	3652220	Now I've created a shape.
3656220	3658220	After you've created a shape,
3658220	3660220	you want to fill it in.
3660220	3662220	You want to fill it in.
3662220	3664220	You want to fill it in.
3664220	3666220	How do you fill it in?
3670220	3672220	You can draw another one,
3672220	3674220	but it's hard to make it
3674220	3676220	exactly the same.
3676220	3678220	So what we're going to do
3678220	3680220	is copy this thing.
3680220	3682220	If we can cut it off
3682220	3684220	and paste it on,
3684220	3686220	it'll be exactly the same.
3686220	3688220	How do I cut this thing off?
3694220	3696220	When I want to cut this thing off,
3696220	3698220	I'm going to do some cutting
3698220	3700220	on this whole object.
3700220	3702220	Do you remember
3702220	3704220	the Illustrator logic I just talked about?
3704220	3706220	There are two little dots here.
3706220	3708220	There are two little dots here.
3708220	3710220	The first thing you need to learn
3710220	3712220	when you learn Illustrator
3712220	3714220	is to select an object
3714220	3716220	and then you can do some settings
3716220	3718220	on this object.
3718220	3720220	The second thing you need to learn
3720220	3722220	is to select the most basic element
3722220	3724220	in this object.
3724220	3726220	is to select the most basic element
3726220	3728220	in this object.
3728220	3730220	So when I click on this little dot,
3730220	3732220	So when I click on this little dot,
3732220	3734220	look at my object.
3734220	3736220	I don't know if you can see it.
3736220	3738220	It's a little small.
3738220	3740220	It's a little small.
3740220	3742220	There's a dot here.
3742220	3744220	There's a dot here.
3744220	3746220	If you can't see it,
3746220	3748220	you can tell me in the chat.
3748220	3750220	I've got a lot of dots.
3750220	3752220	These dots are the dots.
3752220	3754220	I don't need this dot anymore.
3754220	3756220	I don't need this dot anymore.
3756220	3758220	Because I only need the bottom.
3758220	3760220	I can delete it.
3760220	3762220	You see, my picture is gone.
3762220	3764220	You see, my picture is gone.
3764220	3766220	So I can edit it directly.
3766220	3768220	So I can edit it directly.
3768220	3770220	So I've got an element.
3770220	3772220	I don't need the dots.
3772220	3774220	I don't need the dots.
3776220	3778220	There's a trouble with this little dot.
3778220	3780220	If it's deleted, it's gone.
3780220	3782220	If it's deleted, it's gone.
3784220	3786220	If it's deleted, it's gone.
3788220	3790220	What do I do now?
3790220	3792220	What do I do now?
3792220	3794220	I canamazit these dots.
3794220	3796220	I canamazit these dots.
3796220	3798220	The dots I need turn blue.
3798220	3800220	The dots I need turn blue.
3802220	3804220	This allows
3804220	3806220	press down key.
3806220	3808220	press down key.
3808220	3810220	press down key.
3810220	3812220	press down key.
3814220	3816220	Look, it becomes shorter.
3818220	3821220	Now I can Add a different color.
3821220	3823220	Now I can Add a different color.
3823220	3825220	Now I move it.
3827220	3829220	When I move it...
3833220	3835220	When I move it...
3837220	3839220	Why is it not aligned?
3847220	3849220	Now I can move it.
3849220	3851220	Now I can move it.
3851220	3853220	When I move it...
3861220	3863220	When I was modifying it,
3863220	3865220	I accidentally made it smaller.
3877220	3879220	Now I can move it.
3879220	3881220	Now I can move it.
3885220	3887220	Now I can move it.
3891220	3893220	Now I can move it.
3897220	3899220	When I was modifying it,
3899220	3901220	I accidentally made it smaller.
3905220	3907220	When I move it...
3909220	3911220	Now it looks like this.
3911220	3913220	I can modify it a little bit more.
3913220	3915220	I want to make sure these two things are aligned.
3919220	3921220	Now I have a tube.
3923220	3925220	Now I have a tube.
3925220	3927220	It's not perfect at the bottom.
3927220	3929220	You can modify it a few more times.
3929220	3931220	You can make it bigger and modify it a few more times.
3933220	3935220	Now I can copy this.
3935220	3937220	Now I have a tube.
3937220	3939220	Now I have a tube.
3953220	3955220	If you need to,
3955220	3957220	I can show you how to make it.
3957220	3959220	I can show you how to make it.
3959220	3961220	If you want to learn how to do this,
3961220	3963220	you can use that.
3964220	3966220	Now I'm going to draw a star.
3970220	3972220	Now I'm going to draw a star.
3981220	3983220	draw a star
3984220	3986220	There are five legs on this star.
3986220	3988220	I could just make it six legs.
3988220	3991220	I could just press the up and down buttons to make it have more legs.
3991220	3994220	Or I could press the down button to make it have less legs.
3994220	3997220	Illustrator has a lot of shortcut keys.
3997220	4001220	You basically have to practice to remember.
4002220	4004220	For example, I'm using this leg now.
4004220	4007220	And this is my new star, right?
4007220	4010220	I think this star is too sharp.
4010220	4011220	I don't want it to be so sharp.
4011220	4013220	I want it to be round.
4014220	4016220	How do I make it round?
4017220	4019220	I can choose this.
4021220	4025220	I'm going to use this to change the inner components of this star.
4026220	4027220	We just talked about the dots.
4027220	4032220	The dots tell you that there must be a dot on these dots.
4033220	4035220	I'm going to change the curve of this line.
4035220	4037220	I'm going to pull this circle.
4039220	4042220	See if my star is getting fat and round.
4047220	4049220	It's getting fatter and rounder.
4052220	4056220	For example, you don't want this star to be symmetrical.
4056220	4058220	You want this leg to stand out.
4058220	4061220	You can also use this to choose.
4061220	4063220	For example, I want these two dots to stand out.
4064220	4067220	I'm going to choose these two dots and pull them out.
4067220	4070220	I might want these two dots to be particularly sharp.
4071220	4073220	So I'm going to change the curve, right?
4073220	4077220	At this time, you can also use this to choose this dot.
4078220	4080220	I'm going to zoom in on this dot.
4081220	4084220	After you click on this dot, do you see this line up here?
4085220	4087220	This line is called the handle.
4088220	4090220	This handle is to control the curvature.
4094220	4096220	See if this is particularly sharp now.
4098220	4100220	Or you can make a big one like this.
4101220	4103220	I'm going to zoom in now.
4105220	4107220	So when you look at someone else's picture,
4107220	4109220	and you draw a picture,
4109220	4110220	you're thinking,
4110220	4113220	which basic shape can I start to transform?
4116220	4118220	Sir, we have a question here.
4119220	4121220	This is a question about
4121220	4127220	whether the picture will be set to the size of the picture you want first,
4128220	4132220	or do you draw it first and then set it?
4135220	4137220	Another audience member also said,
4137220	4142220	I'm also curious about how to integrate real photos into pictures.
4145220	4146220	OK.
4146220	4148220	Integrate real photos into pictures,
4148220	4150220	is it pulling a picture in?
4152220	4154220	I think that's what it means.
4154220	4157220	For example, if he has a picture of a lab device,
4157220	4159220	how do you integrate it in?
4160220	4161220	OK.
4163220	4165220	I'll talk about the first one first.
4165220	4167220	The first question is very, very good.
4167220	4171220	I think this is a trick that only those who are doing this will know.
4172220	4174220	I'll open one first.
4177220	4179220	I'll open another one.
4180220	4183220	This is a picture of my experiment.
4183220	4189220	I got this picture from something like Excel.
4189220	4191220	And then I dragged it over,
4191220	4193220	and then I beautified it like this.
4194220	4195220	OK.
4195220	4197220	In the process of beautifying,
4197220	4198220	you see,
4198220	4201220	will I make the painting board the size I want?
4201220	4202220	I won't.
4202220	4205220	There are a lot of reasons why I don't do this.
4205220	4207220	Because this painting board is white.
4207220	4209220	When you're painting,
4209220	4211220	if you need something to...
4211220	4213220	For example, when I'm painting now,
4213220	4215220	I might have done something first.
4215220	4217220	For example, I made a star.
4217220	4219220	I'm going to use it later.
4219220	4222220	But if my painting board is very small now,
4222220	4224220	then my star...
4224220	4226220	For example, I can change it now.
4226220	4228220	I can change the painting board directly.
4229220	4230220	OK.
4230220	4232220	For example, I can change the painting board.
4232220	4235220	If my painting board is very, very small at first,
4235220	4237220	If my painting board is very, very small at first,
4258220	4260220	You see, when my painting board is very small,
4260220	4264220	the problem is that my object will be squeezed onto the painting board.
4264220	4266220	Then it will be a little hard for me to see clearly.
4266220	4268220	Because the background is gray.
4268220	4270220	Usually white is easier to paint.
4270220	4272220	So what do I do?
4272220	4275220	I usually use a very large painting board.
4277220	4278220	And then?
4278220	4282220	For example, I want to deal with this data now.
4282220	4284220	Suppose I haven't finished this data.
4284220	4285220	I still want to deal with this data.
4285220	4287220	I want to add something.
4287220	4288220	OK.
4288220	4290220	I can put this...
4290220	4293220	I can put this thing next to it first.
4293220	4295220	And then I'll draw something first.
4295220	4297220	I'll draw...
4298220	4300220	I'll draw the last thing I need.
4300220	4301220	Where is it?
4301220	4302220	Here.
4303220	4308220	Suppose I want to put this last picture on a two-column paper.
4308220	4311220	So I'm going to put it on a...
4315220	4316220	Wait a minute.
4316220	4317220	Black. OK.
4318220	4320220	This is...
4320220	4323220	This is the last thing I'm going to put on the paper.
4324220	4327220	I'm going to put a picture in this space.
4327220	4330220	Usually, if the paper is a two-column...
4332220	4334220	Wait a minute. I'm going to make it bigger.
4342220	4343220	OK.
4343220	4345220	I'm going to choose this square now.
4345220	4346220	I'm just going to pull a square.
4346220	4349220	And then I'm going to adjust the width and length of this square.
4349220	4351220	That's the width and height of the square.
4351220	4356220	I usually use 3.75 inches for a two-column paper.
4359220	4360220	Let me see.
4360220	4361220	I wrote it all down below.
4361220	4363220	How do you draw it?
4363220	4364220	3.75 inches.
4364220	4366220	If it's a double column, it's 3.75 inches.
4366220	4368220	If it's a single column, it's 89 milliliters.
4369220	4370220	OK.
4370220	4375220	I'm going to use 3.75 inches for this thing.
4377220	4378220	That's it.
4379220	4380220	OK.
4380220	4383220	And then I'm going to draw a picture.
4383220	4384220	I'm going to put this picture...
4384220	4386220	I'm going to put my data picture in.
4387220	4390220	And then I can adjust this data picture.
4390220	4391220	OK.
4391220	4392220	For example, I want it to be smaller.
4392220	4394220	Because I want to put another picture next to it.
4394220	4395220	I want it to be smaller.
4395220	4396220	Like this.
4396220	4397220	OK.
4397220	4398220	Like this.
4404220	4405220	Like this.
4406220	4407220	OK.
4407220	4408220	OK.
4408220	4411220	Then I'll put a picture here.
4411220	4412220	And then...
4417220	4419220	And then I'll put another picture here.
4422220	4424220	And then I'll put another picture here.
4424220	4426220	You'll think it's a little crowded.
4426220	4428220	And then you might have to make each picture smaller.
4430220	4432220	Anyway...
4433220	4436220	You just put this grid...
4436220	4439220	I drew this grid as your final size.
4440220	4443220	And then you put your data in first.
4443220	4445220	And then you can start to adjust it inside.
4445220	4447220	For example, you can change this word.
4447220	4449220	I can add a text here.
4449220	4451220	I can re-enter the text.
4451220	4453220	And then I'm sure this text is 11PT.
4454220	4456220	For example, number.
4457220	4459220	I'm going to pull this over here.
4459220	4460220	Like this.
4460220	4461220	You know what I mean?
4461220	4465220	All your drafts are placed outside this box.
4465220	4467220	And then you put your final product in this box.
4467220	4469220	And then you just do it in there.
4469220	4470220	OK.
4470220	4472220	So when I'm done with this picture.
4472220	4474220	This picture is already very beautiful.
4474220	4475220	OK.
4475220	4476220	All done.
4476220	4477220	I'm going to export this picture.
4477220	4479220	At this time, you put the things outside.
4479220	4482220	For example, there may be some squares outside.
4482220	4484220	You delete all these things.
4484220	4485220	OK.
4485220	4486220	Delete all the objects outside.
4486220	4489220	After deleting it, keep this box.
4489220	4491220	This box can't be deleted.
4491220	4492220	Keep this box.
4492220	4493220	Keep this box.
4493220	4496220	And then turn the outer frame of this box into a transparent one.
4498220	4499220	Transparent.
4499220	4501220	And then at this time, you export it again.
4502220	4503220	OK.
4503220	4505220	At this time, you can save as.
4506220	4508220	For example, I'll save it as an EPS.
4508220	4509220	Like this.
4509220	4510220	Example.
4510220	4511220	For example, test1.
4514220	4517220	And then when you export it, you have to choose a blank background.
4518220	4519220	Choose transparent.
4519220	4520220	OK.
4520220	4522220	And then I'll export it.
4523220	4526220	At this time, the picture I exported will be exactly.
4527220	4528220	Just right.
4529220	4530220	This frame.
4530220	4532220	This white frame.
4532220	4533220	It's just right.
4533220	4536220	It's the frame you want to put on the paper.
4536220	4538220	This width is just right.
4538220	4539220	3.75 inches.
4540220	4542220	This is the bottom of this piece of white.
4543220	4545220	When you put the whole picture on it.
4545220	4546220	You won't.
4546220	4547220	Because sometimes you use latex.
4547220	4549220	Or when you put the picture in the text.
4549220	4550220	You'll zoom in.
4550220	4552220	Because you want it to look pretty.
4552220	4553220	So when you zoom in.
4553220	4555220	The font of that text.
4555220	4557220	It's going to zoom in with you.
4557220	4558220	The shape of the picture is going to zoom in with you.
4558220	4560220	So maybe when you were drawing the picture.
4560220	4561220	What are these fonts?
4561220	4562220	11pt.
4562220	4564220	It looks very good.
4564220	4566220	But because you zoom in.
4566220	4567220	Maybe put it in the article.
4567220	4569220	Hey, this 11 font.
4569220	4570220	Zoom in.
4570220	4571220	Maybe it becomes 7.
4571220	4572220	Then you can't see it.
4572220	4573220	It's almost invisible.
4577220	4578220	Hey.
4581220	4583220	So when you use Illustrator.
4583220	4588220	I usually divide my page into two sides.
4588220	4589220	OK.
4589220	4591220	And then the first thing I do.
4591220	4593220	Is to put my last.
4594220	4596220	The size of this picture to be output.
4596220	4598220	Draw it out with a frame.
4598220	4600220	And then the width of this frame can't change.
4600220	4601220	But the length can change.
4601220	4603220	For example, I want to add two more pictures.
4603220	4604220	It might get longer.
4604220	4605220	Yeah.
4605220	4607220	And then I use the right side as my drawing board.
4607220	4609220	And then what am I going to draw?
4609220	4610220	What words do I write?
4610220	4611220	I'll take care of the right side.
4611220	4612220	And then I'll stick it up here.
4612220	4613220	And then slowly align.
4613220	4614220	Yeah.
4614220	4615220	And then after the alignment.
4615220	4617220	You just have to make sure there's nothing out there.
4617220	4618220	And then this frame at the end.
4618220	4620220	If you make it transparent.
4620220	4622220	Your output will be the whole one.
4622220	4624220	It's just like this.
4624220	4625220	You won't be.
4625220	4627220	There's more white on the side.
4627220	4629220	Or the size doesn't fit.
4629220	4631220	What you want is exactly.
4632220	4634220	What you draw is exactly what you want.
4638220	4640220	Does that answer your question?
4645220	4646220	Yes.
4646220	4647220	I was answered.
4647220	4649220	But I don't know if the actor was answered.
4652220	4653220	OK.
4653220	4656220	So you didn't know how to use the animation board at first.
4656220	4659220	The animation board is usually for people who do art.
4659220	4660220	They need to be.
4662220	4664220	When they're printing, there's a problem with the edge.
4664220	4667220	So they're usually the ones who understand the animation board.
4667220	4669220	But I think this is better.
4671220	4673220	And what's the harm in moving the board?
4673220	4676220	You know, like, let's say I'm going to put my board.
4676220	4678220	Make it the size I want.
4680220	4681220	This is a big disadvantage.
4682220	4683220	For example, I guess I will.
4683220	4685220	Well, I was going to say, okay, I'm just.
4685220	4687220	Yeah, you know, all right.
4687220	4688220	My eyes are good.
4688220	4690220	I can see black and white.
4690220	4692220	I'm going to use this direct.
4692220	4694220	Is there any problem with the board?
4694220	4696220	Suppose I just made a drawing on the board.
4696220	4697220	I've done it.
4697220	4698220	And I don't have this frame.
4698220	4701220	I just drew, drew, drew, drew, drew, drew it out.
4702220	4703220	Ok, I'm done.
4703220	4704220	I just want to say, all right.
4704220	4705220	This is a.
4705220	4708220	This is the animation board that I want to output.
4708220	4710220	At this time, I'm.
4711220	4713220	At this time, I'm going to save.
4715220	4718220	And you can see where the difference is.
4727220	4730220	Okay, have you seen the difference between this test and this test?
4731220	4733220	Look at this test.
4733220	4735220	Is this the case where the grid is wider?
4735220	4739220	Is the grid of this test 2 getting narrower?
4742220	4745220	And then you see if this grid is getting narrower.
4745220	4747220	This distance is also a little wider.
4750220	4753220	So why is that?
4753220	4755220	Why isn't it?
4755220	4757220	Look at how wide my panel is here.
4757220	4760220	Look at how wide my panel is here.
4760220	4763220	How does it look different from my final output?
4763220	4766220	Why is this so wide? Why is this so narrow?
4769220	4772220	On the contrary, if I used this grid at the beginning,
4772220	4775220	You see, this is so wide, this is so wide.
4775220	4777220	Right?
4777220	4779220	So why is this?
4779220	4781220	This is because when we're saving,
4781220	4783220	Because this is an image.
4783220	4786220	So your program will use
4786220	4789220	Illustrator will use the simplest way to save your image.
4789220	4791220	That is to say, you see,
4791220	4794220	If I frame all these tools,
4794220	4797220	You see, my tool actually only takes up so much of the panel.
4797220	4799220	I didn't use the whole panel.
4799220	4801220	So your computer will be very smart.
4801220	4803220	It will choose this smallest frame.
4803220	4805220	The space you actually use.
4805220	4808220	And then you make it into a square and you output it directly.
4808220	4810220	And if you don't use this place, it won't output.
4810220	4813220	So what you're actually outputting is
4813220	4816220	It's a little bit wider than you want it to be.
4816220	4818220	There's a little bit of a gap.
4818220	4822220	So that's why I'm going to put a frame here.
4822220	4824220	To make sure that when you output it,
4824220	4827220	It's the whole frame that I want.
4829220	4830220	Got it.
4830220	4834220	Okay, Yan said she got it.
4834220	4836220	Okay, good, good.
4836220	4838220	What's the second question?
4838220	4842220	I think the audience has a lot of questions right now.
4842220	4845220	Otherwise, we'll just answer the audience's questions directly.
4845220	4848220	We'll take the rest of the time to answer the audience's questions, okay?
4848220	4850220	Okay, okay.
4850220	4857220	The second question is how to integrate the actual photo into the picture.
4857220	4858220	Okay.
4858220	4861220	And then this question is also a very good question.
4861220	4863220	This is very tricky.
4863220	4868220	I'm just sharing a screen.
4868220	4874220	I'm assuming I don't want these things now.
4874220	4877220	And then I'm going to put a picture in there.
4889220	4893220	For example, I have a picture here.
4893220	4894220	Okay, okay.
4894220	4901220	And then you see, I just took this picture from my desktop.
4901220	4902220	It's big now, isn't it?
4902220	4905220	So I'm going to shrink it a little bit now.
4905220	4907220	I'm using the shortcut to shrink it now.
4907220	4911220	But if you have a magnifier here, you can also use this magnifier to shrink it.
4914220	4917220	Okay, I'm going to shrink it now, and then I'm going to use the first one.
4917220	4918220	The first one.
4918220	4919220	This is a picture.
4919220	4922220	It can no longer be broken into components.
4922220	4925220	So when you choose, you always make the first choice.
4925220	4928220	If you choose the second one, this picture will be easily destroyed by you.
4928220	4930220	Okay, I've chosen this one now.
4930220	4933220	Okay, so I'm going to shrink it now, and I'm going to put it on my drawing board.
4939220	4942220	And then I'm going to zoom in and see what it looks like.
4951220	4956220	If I want to put this picture up, I can just put it up.
4960220	4963220	And then what's the advantage of Illustrator?
4963220	4970220	I'm on the left side of the picture, and I'm on the right side of the picture, right?
4970220	4971220	That's okay.
4971220	4976220	It's just a picture that's going to be a thing.
4976220	4979220	So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.
4979220	4982220	I'll save it.
4986220	4988220	So when you export it, both of them will export.
4988220	4991220	So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.
4991220	4994220	So when you export it, it's the same, both of them will export.
4994220	4997220	So you say, okay, this is an EPS, it's supposed to be a image.
4997220	4999220	So I'm not going to be a real one when I zoom in.
4999220	5002220	Okay, so the problem is, the left one is all really a real one.
5002220	5003220	It's not going to be real.
5003220	5005220	But the right one is.
5005220	5007220	I've been zooming in and out.
5007220	5012220	You see, this MF is starting to be real.
5012220	5015220	So you want to put a picture in and drag it in.
5015220	5016220	It's very simple.
5016220	5018220	But it's a little tricky.
5018220	5020220	You have to take this big picture.
5020220	5023220	Because when you take this picture, it's a big file.
5023220	5025220	It's a big size.
5025220	5029220	So I recommend all the pictures.
5029220	5030220	Even if he's not with anyone else.
5030220	5032220	If you want to put it on your own.
5032220	5034220	This picture is best handled by AI.
5034220	5036220	You just drag it in like this.
5036220	5038220	There's only one picture in the whole panel.
5038220	5040220	It's better to come in.
5040220	5044220	Because when you come in, you can take it from the original size.
5044220	5046220	Maybe 1.3 megabytes.
5046220	5048220	You just zoom in and out.
5048220	5050220	Now we have this panel.
5050220	5052220	It's the size we're going to export.
5052220	5057220	For example, you want this picture to be this big.
5057220	5060220	You can just look at it in this export size.
5060220	5063220	Is it still readable?
5063220	5067220	If I shrink it to this size, it's already blurred.
5067220	5070220	That's just asking you to remake a picture.
5070220	5073220	You need a high-resolution picture.
5073220	5076220	If you look at this picture, it's good.
5076220	5078220	This picture is after I took it down.
5078220	5082220	It's still very clear.
5082220	5083220	You see, I put it in a big way.
5083220	5085220	Normally, a paper wouldn't be that big.
5085220	5088220	Basically, it's still very clear.
5088220	5090220	This picture is OK.
5090220	5092220	This kind of photo doesn't usually require much.
5092220	5094220	As long as you can see it when you zoom in.
5094220	5096220	And the main feature is that you can see it.
5096220	5098220	That's OK.
5099220	5101220	So when you shrink this picture, make sure it's visible.
5101220	5103220	It's the first thing you have to do.
5103220	5105220	The second thing you have to do is export it.
5105220	5109220	Like I just exported it to TAS 2, right?
5109220	5112220	I can come over now and see how big this TAS 2 is.
5112220	5114220	It's 3.4 MB.
5114220	5119220	Compared to this one, my first one is a full-size picture.
5119220	5120220	It's only 1.1 MB.
5120220	5123220	As a result, after I added a picture, it became 3.4 MB.
5124220	5126220	So when you're taking pictures,
5126220	5130220	Sometimes you use a very fancy camera.
5130220	5132220	The picture you take is 4K.
5132220	5134220	The file is super big.
5134220	5138220	After you export it, it's 1 GB or 500 MB.
5138220	5139220	That's not going to work.
5139220	5141220	Because often, for example, if you add four pictures together,
5141220	5144220	It can only be, for example, 25 MB.
5144220	5147220	Then you put a high-resolution picture on it first.
5147220	5150220	Basically, it takes up all your space.
5150220	5151220	That's not going to work.
5151220	5152220	What do you do at this time?
5152220	5155220	You have to go back and take this picture of yours.
5155220	5158220	Use other software to lower its quality.
5158220	5160220	It's not that good resolution.
5160220	5162220	But it's visible.
5162220	5164220	So when you put the picture in,
5164220	5166220	You have to make sure the resolution is high enough.
5166220	5168220	It's high enough to be visible.
5168220	5170220	But you have to make sure it's not too high.
5170220	5172220	Because it takes up a lot of resources.
5172220	5182220	So this is the main problem.
5182220	5188220	And then some people might want to, for example,
5188220	5194220	For example, like this one, I just want to make a beautiful one.
5194220	5195220	I'm going to give you a talk.
5195220	5197220	I'm going to give you a beautiful picture like this.
5197220	5199220	I want this picture to be the background of my data.
5200220	5203220	Suppose I want it to be the background of my data.
5203220	5204220	I can do the same thing.
5206220	5208220	I'm going to pull it to the size I want.
5208220	5211220	And then I want it to be at the bottom, right?
5211220	5218220	So I'm going to put this thing at the bottom.
5218220	5220220	So my data will show up on top.
5222220	5225220	And then I can usually, if you do this kind of thing,
5225220	5226220	You're going to need opacity.
5226220	5228220	I just want it to be a little transparent.
5228220	5229220	Like this.
5230220	5233220	That's it.
5233220	5236220	It looks like this data is related to AI.
5236220	5237220	Something like that.
5237220	5239220	That's fine, too.
5239220	5240220	But it's the same thing.
5240220	5242220	Every time you want to put in a picture,
5242220	5245220	You have to pay attention to the resolution of this picture.
5245220	5247220	It doesn't have a set rule that says how much it has to be.
5247220	5250220	The guideline is that you can see it when you zoom in.
5250220	5251220	That's it.
5253220	5255220	I had a real problem before.
5255220	5257220	How do you cut it?
5258220	5259220	Do you want this?
5259220	5260220	Yeah.
5260220	5261220	Oh, you don't want it.
5261220	5263220	You're going to step on it, right?
5263220	5264220	Yeah.
5264220	5268220	Okay, let's get the opacity back first.
5269220	5270220	Pull it back.
5270220	5271220	Okay.
5271220	5273220	You just click on this.
5273220	5276220	You just click on what you want to do.
5276220	5279220	Basically, this bar up here.
5279220	5281220	It has almost everything you want.
5281220	5283220	If it's beyond your imagination,
5283220	5284220	If it's not on top of it,
5284220	5286220	You'll just have it on YouTube.
5286220	5287220	It's going to be at the top.
5287220	5289220	In this detail.
5289220	5290220	Yeah.
5290220	5291220	Do you want to crop?
5291220	5292220	Basically.
5292220	5294220	Then you press crop.
5296220	5298220	Then you just cut it.
5313220	5314220	Apply.
5314220	5316220	Okay, that's it.
5318220	5319220	Because it's an object now.
5319220	5323220	If you want to put a star on it.
5325220	5327220	I want to dig a star.
5327220	5328220	I can do this.
5328220	5329220	Dig like this.
5334220	5335220	Got it.
5337220	5339220	Let's go to the next question.
5339220	5340220	Okay.
5340220	5341220	The next question is,
5341220	5346220	Can Illustrator add dots or lines to the pattern?
5346220	5348220	Yeah, that's a question.
5348220	5350220	And then I just saw another one.
5350220	5352220	A similar question.
5352220	5354220	Let's talk about it together.
5354220	5355220	Okay.
5357220	5360220	The other question is,
5360220	5364220	In the example of the chemical measuring bottle,
5364220	5367220	Is there a concept of scissors in Illustrator?
5367220	5369220	So you don't have to delete the dots one by one.
5369220	5371220	Just cut out the parts we don't want.
5372220	5373220	Oh, okay.
5373220	5374220	Yeah.
5375220	5377220	Basically, it's delete.
5377220	5379220	Or backspace.
5379220	5381220	That's the one on your shoulder.
5381220	5384220	For example, we're back here now, right?
5384220	5388220	So what else can I do with this?
5388220	5391220	I just shortened that dot.
5391220	5393220	I'm going to use a way to add dots.
5393220	5395220	To make this picture.
5396220	5398220	This thing.
5398220	5400220	I just didn't say that.
5400220	5403220	If I just press this now.
5403220	5405220	I'm going to edit the dots now.
5405220	5408220	So I'm going to change the oil to direct selection.
5408220	5410220	Then I can start to change the component.
5410220	5412220	I'll click on this object first.
5412220	5414220	One, two, three, four, five.
5414220	5416220	I see that there are so many dots now.
5416220	5418220	I don't want these three on top of me.
5418220	5420220	I'll take it off first.
5420220	5422220	I'll press delete.
5423220	5425220	I'm going to press the keyboard to delete or backspace.
5425220	5427220	You can do this.
5427220	5428220	Or?
5428220	5430220	Sometimes your dots are very dense.
5430220	5432220	You might not be able to do that.
5432220	5434220	It's so good, it's framed to your liking.
5434220	5436220	At this time, you can.
5436220	5438220	Uh, for example, you have to choose.
5438220	5440220	You might be, uh.
5440220	5442220	Okay, you press this.
5442220	5443220	Then you choose this.
5443220	5445220	I'm going to choose a dot now, right?
5445220	5446220	I'm going to press shift.
5446220	5447220	Just don't put shift.
5447220	5449220	I can start to choose more dots.
5450220	5452220	But because this is an image.
5452220	5454220	It's not, uh.
5454220	5456220	It's not like a little painter or a photo.
5456220	5458220	Uh, that, that.
5458220	5460220	What's that? Photoshop.
5460220	5462220	Yeah, he didn't cut it.
5462220	5463220	It's like cutting it off from the middle.
5463220	5464220	He didn't.
5464220	5466220	But he can do that.
5466220	5469220	It's just that he has to go in.
5469220	5474220	Delete every dot and line of the image.
5474220	5476220	Or you can, you can delete it together.
5477220	5479220	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a dot.
5479220	5480220	How do I add it?
5480220	5482220	Because I'm now the problem is the dot.
5482220	5484220	So I'm going to move the dot now.
5484220	5486220	You can see the left side of the toolbar.
5486220	5488220	There's one of these things in there.
5488220	5490220	Okay.
5490220	5491220	Usually you see this.
5491220	5493220	This is the pen tool.
5493220	5496220	The pen tool, you press the right button.
5496220	5499220	Or you, you just press this triangle.
5499220	5501220	He's going to have four options.
5501220	5504220	The first one is to draw a dot.
5505220	5506220	I don't draw a line.
5506220	5507220	I don't draw a picture.
5507220	5509220	I just draw a dot.
5509220	5512220	For example, like this.
5512220	5515220	Okay, I'll just draw a dot.
5515220	5519220	The second one is to add a dot.
5519220	5520220	The third one is to subtract a dot.
5520220	5522220	The fourth one is to pull the handle.
5522220	5524220	That's what I'm doing now, right?
5524220	5526220	But I want him to have a handle.
5526220	5528220	I can use the fourth one to pull the handle.
5528220	5531220	That's how you add a dot.
5532220	5534220	I'm going to add a dot here.
5534220	5535220	I'm going to add a dot here.
5535220	5540220	Okay, that's it.
5540220	5542220	So what am I doing now?
5542220	5544220	I'm going to use this shape to click on this.
5544220	5545220	Look at this.
5545220	5547220	I'm going to use this direct selection to see.
5547220	5550220	I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
5550220	5552220	There are two more dots here, right?
5552220	5553220	I'm going to be happy now.
5553220	5555220	Pick it up and delete it.
5555220	5560220	That's it.
5560220	5564220	And then I can just put this over here.
5564220	5565220	I might want to cover this up.
5565220	5567220	I might want to cover this up.
5567220	5569220	Otherwise, it's a little weird.
5569220	5574220	I'm going to use this pen tool to cover this up.
5574220	5575220	I'm going to cover this up.
5575220	5576220	And then I'm going to put this over here.
5576220	5579220	Sometimes when you delete a dot, the shape will be a little bit of a walk.
5579220	5581220	This is the color scheme.
5581220	5584220	You might want to pay a little attention to it.
5584220	5589220	I used some of the tricks yesterday.
5589220	5594220	I used some of the tricks yesterday.
5594220	5597220	It's just that it's exactly the same.
5597220	5600220	If anyone wants to know later, we can share it.
5600220	5603220	But this is how you increase the number of dots.
5603220	5604220	You can also cut the dots.
5604220	5605220	You can also cut the dots.
5605220	5606220	You can also cut the dots.
5606220	5607220	You can also cut the dots.
5607220	5609220	You can also cut the dots.
5609220	5610220	And then I cut the dots.
5610220	5613220	I can also use this thing to pull the handle.
5614220	5618220	I don't like this dot.
5618220	5620220	I can press this.
5620220	5623220	I can press this.
5623220	5628220	I'm going to use this little thing.
5628220	5632220	I'm going to use this little thing.
5632220	5638220	And then I'm going to pull this handle.
5638220	5644220	And then I'm going to pull this handle.
5644220	5645220	Okay, look.
5645220	5652220	It's a little heart.
5652220	5654220	Okay.
5654220	5657220	And then the other question is,
5657220	5667220	Did you also adjust the dots for the Neuroscientist picture in the first video?
5667220	5680220	Which one is the Neuroscientist picture?
5680220	5685220	Are you talking about this one?
5685220	5687220	Yes, it should be.
5687220	5688220	It should be this one, right?
5688220	5691220	Okay.
5691220	5692220	This is a very good question.
5692220	5697220	This picture is actually a little complicated, right?
5697220	5699220	He can use that dot.
5699220	5701220	If I made this picture,
5701220	5704220	I might pull a star first.
5704220	5708220	And then let that star become, for example, an octagonal star.
5708220	5713220	And then I make each star round.
5713220	5717220	But because you know this line, you don't have to do it yourself.
5717220	5720220	I know it's going to take a lot of time to simulate this picture.
5720220	5723220	Because I want to make sure that the curvature is exactly the same.
5723220	5725220	But when you draw it yourself,
5725220	5730220	For example, I can draw a simple Neuroscientist for you now.
5730220	5732220	I'm like this.
5732220	5734220	Okay.
5734220	5737220	And then I want this one to be, for example, it's curved.
5737220	5738220	Right?
5738220	5743220	Then I can make it curved.
5743220	5745220	This one is curved.
5745220	5747220	This one is curved like this.
5747220	5749220	I drew it a little ugly.
5753220	5755220	I can make it curved.
5755220	5757220	And then here.
5757220	5760220	And then I might want it to be crooked.
5760220	5763220	Then I'll add two more dots.
5764220	5767220	For example, add a few more dots.
5767220	5770220	And then I'll pull this dot out.
5770220	5773220	And then the dots are also curved.
5775220	5777220	This one is also curved.
5777220	5780220	Wait a minute. I'm going to break this one.
5784220	5786220	This is also curved.
5788220	5791220	And then this one here is also curved.
5791220	5793220	Okay.
5793220	5796220	Basically, you're just doing this kind of thing.
5796220	5798220	You're just adjusting it slowly.
5798220	5803220	And then it's going to get better and better.
5803220	5805220	Okay.
5807220	5809220	It's easy to draw it up and then slowly draw it.
5809220	5811220	You just want to draw it all the time.
5811220	5815220	But anyway, this is it.
5815220	5817220	This is it.
5817220	5819220	You just add your own dots like this.
5820220	5822220	So what do we usually do?
5822220	5824220	There are two ways to do it.
5824220	5827220	One is that you draw on the paper first.
5827220	5829220	Draw a draft. It doesn't matter if it's ugly.
5829220	5831220	Put the paper down and stick it on.
5831220	5833220	And then when you're pulling the dots,
5833220	5835220	you stick it to the line you drew.
5835220	5836220	Pull it.
5836220	5838220	That way, it's going to be smooth.
5838220	5840220	It's not going to be that ugly.
5840220	5842220	The other way is if you have
5842220	5844220	an Adobe software.
5844220	5846220	There's another software in Adobe.
5846220	5848220	It's called Adobe Capture.
5848220	5850220	It's basically...
5850220	5854220	I think Google has this feature, too.
5854220	5856220	You type in NeuronCell.
5856220	5859220	And then it's going to have a vector neuron cell that someone else drew.
5859220	5861220	You can just pull in someone else's neuron cell.
5861220	5863220	And then modify it.
5863220	5865220	For example, you just need a few more touches.
5865220	5867220	And then you can do this, too.
5867220	5871220	For example, I don't know if this one has it.
5871220	5874220	You can see that I'm doing AI right now.
5874220	5876220	There's a neuron cell in the upper right corner, right?
5878220	5882220	You can search for someone else's neuron cell.
5882220	5884220	Look, I have so many neuron cells.
5886220	5888220	You might want to draw this one.
5888220	5890220	You might want to draw a simple two-dimensional picture.
5890220	5892220	Let's say you want to draw this one.
5894220	5896220	This is generally...
5896220	5898220	If you buy Adobe Stock, you can use it directly.
5898220	5900220	If you don't buy it,
5900220	5902220	you can screenshot it.
5902220	5904220	You can take a picture of it.
5904220	5906220	And then paste it in.
5906220	5908220	For example, like this.
5908220	5910220	I can screenshot it.
5910220	5912220	I'll take a picture, paste it in.
5912220	5914220	And then copy it and draw a similar one.
5914220	5916220	I have a lot of...
5922220	5924220	Here.
5924220	5926220	Here.
5930220	5932220	I can paste this picture in.
5932220	5934220	And then put it at the end.
5938220	5940220	And then I can start.
5940220	5942220	Just follow this picture.
5942220	5944220	I can...
5944220	5946220	Make this colorless.
5946220	5948220	And then start.
5948220	5950220	Just start copying it.
5950220	5952220	Okay.
5952220	5954220	Or I can even
5954220	5956220	add dots directly.
5964220	5966220	Okay.
5966220	5968220	Why is this panel so short?
5968220	5980220	Okay.
5984220	5986220	Okay.
5986220	5988220	Or I can
5988220	5990220	add dots directly.
5990220	5992220	For example,
5992220	5994220	I zoom in now, right?
5994220	5996220	And then I want...
5996220	5998220	You can see that I may need a dot here.
5998220	6000220	I may need a dot here.
6000220	6002220	I may need a dot here.
6002220	6004220	I may need a dot here.
6004220	6006220	I can draw a skeleton
6006220	6008220	one by one.
6008220	6010220	This may be easier than the stars.
6010220	6012220	Okay.
6012220	6014220	The more dots you have, the more you have to adjust.
6014220	6016220	But of course it will look more real.
6020220	6022220	Okay.
6022220	6024220	Oh, I drew this badly.
6024220	6026220	You probably know what I mean.
6026220	6028220	You can learn it one by one.
6028220	6030220	You can learn it one by one.
6030220	6032220	Okay.
6032220	6034220	This is a pretty good example.
6034220	6036220	Okay.
6036220	6038220	And then we have some more questions.
6038220	6040220	And then we have some more questions.
6040220	6042220	Is it...
6042220	6044220	Is it...
6044220	6046220	Is it...
6046220	6048220	Is it...
6048220	6050220	Is it...
6050220	6052220	Is it...
6052220	6054220	Is it...
6054220	6056220	Is it...
6056220	6058220	Is it...
6058220	6060220	Is it...
6060220	6062220	Is it...
6062220	6064220	Is it...
6064220	6066220	Is it...
6066220	6068220	Is it...
6068220	6070220	Is it...
6074220	6076220	okay.
6076220	6078220	Okay.
6078220	6080220	Okay.
6080220	6082220	I actually have a case today.
6082220	6084220	I'm going to talk about this.
6084220	6086220	So I can use this picture.
6086220	6088220	I'll delete this picture first.
6088220	6090220	I'll delete this picture first.
6090220	6092220	Can you
6092220	6094220	Can you
6094220	6096220	Can you
6096220	6098220	Can you
6098220	6100220	Can you
6100220	6102220	Can you
6102220	6104220	Can you
6104220	6106220	Can you
6106220	6108220	Can you
6108220	6110220	Can you
6110220	6112220	Can you
6112220	6114220	Can you
6114220	6116220	Can you
6116220	6118220	Can you
6118220	6120220	Can you
6120220	6122220	Can you
6122220	6124220	Can you
6124220	6126220	Can you
6126220	6128220	Can you
6128220	6130220	Can you
6130220	6132220	Can you
6132220	6134220	Can you
6134220	6136220	Thank you
6136220	6137260	Thank you
6137260	6138220	Thank you
6138220	6140220	Thank you
6140220	6142220	Thank you
6142220	6144220	Thank you
6144220	6146220	Thank you
6146220	6148220	Thank you
6148220	6150220	Thank you
6150220	6152220	Thank you
6152220	6154220	Thank you
6154220	6156220	Thank you
6156220	6158220	Thank you
6158220	6160220	Thank you
6160220	6162220	Thank you
6162220	6164220	Thank you
6164220	6168220	Let's make a final size box
6170220	6172220	This box
6174220	6176220	Let me adjust this box
6176220	6178220	The size of this box is
6178220	6180220	3.75 inches
6180220	6182220	Assuming this is 3.75 inches
6184220	6188220	This is my original picture
6190220	6192220	I'm going to put this original picture in
6192220	6194220	I'm going to put it in
6194220	6196220	I'm going to put it in
6196220	6198220	But you see I put it in
6198220	6200220	Don't you think this line is particularly fat?
6202220	6204220	And the word might be very small
6204220	6206220	Not the font you want
6206220	6208220	This is a little bit of trouble
6208220	6210220	This is when I first told you
6210220	6212220	When you are sure to use the picture
6212220	6214220	The font you output directly to the software
6214220	6216220	It's best to be the last font you use
6216220	6218220	So you don't have to change it when you come in
6218220	6220220	Because for example, you output
6220220	6222220	For example, my picture
6222220	6224220	I'm from my Excel
6224220	6226220	After I output it from my Number
6226220	6228220	I didn't specify
6228220	6230220	my
6230220	6232220	The size of these letters
6232220	6234220	I didn't specify the size
6234220	6236220	So he might use something like 28, 32
6236220	6238220	Very big
6238220	6240220	And then when I put it on, it becomes very big
6240220	6242220	And when I shrink
6242220	6244220	It's just that it's a little bit deformed
6244220	6246220	It's a little weird
6246220	6248220	So when you output
6248220	6250220	For example, your tick
6250220	6252220	All your numbers are 11
6252220	6254220	Then
6254220	6256220	Or 9
6256220	6258220	This is the best
6258220	6260220	So you don't have to change it here
6260220	6262220	It's very troublesome
6262220	6264220	What about the thickness of this line
6264220	6266220	You'd better set it first
6266220	6268220	If you can't set it, you can come here and change it
6268220	6270220	I'll show you how to change it now
6272220	6274220	When you put the data in here
6274220	6276220	You don't want to make false data
6276220	6278220	So every time you shrink
6278220	6280220	There's a tool here
6282220	6284220	Take this
6284220	6286220	Free Transform
6286220	6288220	Free Transform is
6288220	6290220	After you pick up some objects
6290220	6292220	You can use Free Transform
6292220	6294220	To shrink
6294220	6296220	You can shrink like this
6296220	6298220	Or you can rotate
6298220	6300220	When you use Free Transform
6300220	6302220	You must press Shift
6302220	6304220	So I'm going to write it down
6310220	6312220	You have to press Shift when you shrink
6312220	6314220	If you press Shift
6314220	6316220	The proportion of your length and width will be fixed
6316220	6318220	So you don't make false
6318220	6320220	The whole data is suddenly deformed
6320220	6322220	So you have to do this
6322220	6324220	After I do this
6324220	6326220	I'm going to come in and change the thickness of this data
6326220	6328220	How to change
6328220	6330220	At this time, I'm going to talk about
6330220	6332220	How does the general software process the layout?
6332220	6334220	You see, we're processing the layout in the AI
6334220	6336220	All the things are dots
6336220	6338220	The lines are connected, right?
6338220	6340220	It's very simple
6340220	6342220	It's like our kids are drawing
6342220	6344220	But the general software is processing the layout
6344220	6346220	It's not like this
6346220	6348220	It's to make sure that every line or every layout
6348220	6350220	After the output
6350220	6352220	It's still the way it was
6352220	6354220	So every layout
6354220	6356220	Every line, every dot
6356220	6358220	Even every number, every icon
6358220	6360220	We're going to use a thing called clipping mask
6360220	6362220	It's the protector
6366220	6368220	What is clipping mask?
6368220	6370220	You must be doing powerpoint
6370220	6372220	There is
6374220	6376220	Let me see
6376220	6378220	You must be doing powerpoint
6378220	6380220	There's something about it
6380220	6382220	For example, I added a slide
6382220	6384220	OK
6384220	6386220	You see, I'm in this slide
6386220	6388220	Is there a picture on the left?
6392220	6394220	Is there a picture on the left of my slide?
6394220	6396220	If I want to change a picture
6396220	6398220	Do I pull in a picture?
6400220	6402220	You see, this picture is different from my original picture
6404220	6406220	I had so many neurons in my original picture
6406220	6408220	My neurons are now cut off
6408220	6410220	What should I do?
6410220	6412220	How did this happen?
6412220	6414220	The reason is because
6414220	6416220	All the software
6416220	6418220	It's to make sure
6418220	6420220	It's the same
6420220	6422220	It's going to add a clipping mask
6422220	6424220	I'm going to show you a clipping mask
6424220	6426220	Double this pattern
6426220	6428220	You see, there are two
6428220	6430220	The first one is your original picture
6430220	6432220	This one
6432220	6434220	The second one is your mask
6434220	6436220	Your mask
6436220	6438220	You see, I'm going to show you a clipping mask
6438220	6440220	The part that the mask frames
6440220	6442220	It's the last thing that's going to show up
6444220	6446220	OK
6446220	6448220	What about this idea?
6448220	6450220	This is our battle
6450220	6452220	Drawing is the biggest problem with modified timetable
6452220	6454220	Look at this
6454220	6456220	This picture is just
6456220	6458220	From
6458220	6460220	Just let it go
6460220	6462220	Let's just look at this line
6462220	6464220	This line
6464220	6466220	When I choose this line now
6466220	6468220	I can't just choose this line
6468220	6470220	Did you notice that I chose this whole thing
6470220	6472220	Because the mask of this line is so big
6474220	6476220	I'm going to move this out now
6476220	6478220	Did you see
6478220	6480220	When I choose this line
6480220	6482220	It's not these anchor points
6482220	6484220	It's not a line
6484220	6486220	But what does this mean
6486220	6488220	This doesn't mean that my data is so big
6488220	6490220	No, this means that my data is
6490220	6492220	It's just dots and lines
6492220	6494220	It's just data
6494220	6496220	This one outside is its mask
6496220	6498220	What can I do now?
6498220	6500220	I can double click now
6500220	6502220	I'm going to double click now
6502220	6504220	This thing is what I'm going to do
6504220	6506220	This is what we call Compound
6506220	6508220	OK
6508220	6510220	I'm using the first arrow now
6510220	6512220	I'm going to frame the whole big screen
6514220	6516220	Then you see
6516220	6518220	I framed this
6518220	6520220	Who is this
6520220	6522220	This is this line
6522220	6524220	Then you see this line
6524220	6526220	I moved it out of the clipping mask
6526220	6528220	It was cut off
6528220	6530220	I don't know if you have this idea
6530220	6532220	First of all, I'm going to move this over
6532220	6534220	OK
6544220	6546220	You see
6546220	6548220	I have this thing
6548220	6550220	This big mask
6550220	6552220	And then the data inside
6552220	6554220	When I'm changing
6554220	6556220	I'm going to change the data inside
6556220	6558220	So you usually have to point at the data you want to point at
6558220	6560220	And then dot dot dot dot
6560220	6562220	You see
6562220	6564220	I clicked a few more times
6564220	6566220	I finally clicked into this one
6566220	6568220	You see if I can see it now
6568220	6570220	I zoom in and see if I can see it now
6570220	6572220	Circle circle
6572220	6574220	This is the image
6574220	6576220	I finally got this data
6576220	6578220	I can choose this circle now
6578220	6580220	Then you can choose this line
6580220	6582220	Sometimes you have to click a few more times
6582220	6584220	Very troublesome
6584220	6586220	Then I can put this stroke now
6586220	6588220	Become more
6588220	6590220	Become thinner
6594220	6596220	For example, I use 1.75
6596220	6598220	I like to use 1.75 the most
6600220	6602220	Then these circles are the same
6602220	6604220	You are the same
6604220	6606220	You don't want it to be so thick
6606220	6608220	So you have to go in and choose
6608220	6610220	Click a few more times to choose this circle
6612220	6614220	Then become 1.75
6614220	6616220	Change one by one
6616220	6618220	You see this is actually very troublesome
6618220	6620220	How do I do this efficiently?
6622220	6624220	We may want to take this mask
6626220	6628220	I just choose this thing first
6628220	6630220	Then I'm going to pick up this object
6630220	6632220	Right click
6632220	6634220	Then press this
6634220	6636220	I'm going to take this mask off
6636220	6638220	Take it off
6638220	6640220	OK, now this thing
6640220	6642220	After I re-frame it
6642220	6644220	You see, it's completely
6644220	6646220	These groups of circles and lines
6648220	6650220	I want to change this thing
6650220	6652220	It's easier
6656220	6658220	I can do this
6658220	6660220	Then it will wash
6660220	6662220	I just moved it out
6662220	6664220	Don't do it when you are doing your own data
6664220	6666220	This is ugly
6666220	6668220	There is a risk of fake data
6668220	6670220	I just want to make it easy for you to see the mask
6670220	6672220	So I just moved it out
6672220	6674220	Actually, when you are operating
6674220	6676220	You usually do this
6676220	6678220	You just choose this
6678220	6680220	After choosing this thing
6680220	6682220	You just choose your object
6682220	6684220	Move a little bit first
6684220	6686220	Make sure you get it
6686220	6688220	Then press ctrl-z
6688220	6690220	Right click, release this mask
6690220	6692220	When I release the mask
6692220	6694220	I originally chose an object
6694220	6696220	You see, there are two boxes
6696220	6698220	One is my data line box
6698220	6700220	The other is the mask box
6700220	6702220	Now you can put this mask box
6702220	6704220	You can also choose this mask box
6704220	6706220	Delete it
6706220	6708220	I think I chose the wrong one
6712220	6714220	Wait a minute
6714220	6716220	These two
6716220	6718220	Then I choose this
6720220	6722220	Delete
6722220	6724220	Now this box is gone
6724220	6726220	I can choose the data I want
6726220	6728220	Change its appearance
6730220	6732220	Like this
6734220	6736220	The most annoying part of AI
6736220	6738220	Just look at each of these
6738220	6740220	Just this bar
6740220	6742220	Look at our bar
6742220	6744220	This bar
6744220	6746220	It's not like a text
6748220	6750220	When you enter the text
6750220	6752220	Choose the bottom line of the text
6752220	6754220	It means it's a text
6754220	6756220	But when you enter
6756220	6758220	That bar
6758220	6760220	It becomes an object
6760220	6762220	It doesn't have that line
6762220	6764220	And it doesn't have a lot of dots
6764220	6766220	So it means this thing
6766220	6768220	It's also protected by the mask
6768220	6770220	Just press the right button
6770220	6772220	Ok
6772220	6774220	Sorry
6774220	6776220	And then the same thing
6776220	6778220	Cut off the outline of this bar
6780220	6782220	So you can choose
6784220	6786220	So when all the software
6786220	6788220	Enter Illustrator to draw
6788220	6790220	The most annoying thing is
6790220	6792220	You have to put every little thing
6792220	6794220	The clipping mask is all released
6794220	6796220	And then delete those masks
6796220	6798220	Delete those masks
6798220	6800220	And then edit it
6802220	6804220	And then after this thing
6806220	6808220	There's something important
6808220	6810220	A lot of people didn't notice
6810220	6812220	I want to talk about
6812220	6814220	After you enter the number
6814220	6816220	You might have the size
6816220	6818220	And then you have to output
6818220	6820220	And then you have the font
6820220	6822220	And then you output
6822220	6824220	And then your picture
6824220	6826220	After using another computer
6826220	6828220	I found that the font
6828220	6830220	I can't find it
6830220	6832220	But the font is ugly
6832220	6834220	What should I do
6834220	6836220	This is a very common problem
6836220	6838220	Your computer font
6838220	6840220	Windows font
6840220	6842220	Mac font
6842220	6844220	There's a problem when you switch
6844220	6846220	So the best way at this time
6846220	6848220	You type all the words
6848220	6850220	For example, this bar
6850220	6852220	I have a number
6852220	6854220	After I type it
6854220	6856220	You circle all these words
6856220	6858220	Right click
6858220	6860220	Then click Create Outline
6862220	6864220	I'll zoom in for you
6864220	6866220	This bar is just a bar
6866220	6868220	It's a text
6868220	6870220	After I create it
6870220	6872220	It's not a text
6874220	6876220	I'm using this A
6876220	6878220	Look at this picture
6878220	6880220	It's not a text anymore
6880220	6882220	It's a lot of dots
6882220	6884220	Look at this picture
6884220	6886220	It's already a text
6886220	6888220	When you output it on a different computer
6888220	6890220	There will be no font
6890220	6892220	Unreadable problem
6902220	6904220	Understand
6904220	6906220	And then the audience
6906220	6908220	Someone said
6908220	6910220	That is
6910220	6912220	You can see more clearly
6912220	6914220	Masks and objects
6914220	6916220	Layer management
6916220	6918220	Yes, there is a layer management
6918220	6920220	There is a layer management
6920220	6922220	You can
6922220	6924220	You put everything on different layers
6924220	6926220	You can see the objects
6928220	6930220	But I rarely use this
6930220	6932220	I personally rarely use this feature
6932220	6934220	I don't remember
6934220	6936220	How to set up layers
6936220	6938220	But if you're interested
6938220	6940220	There are a lot of layers
6940220	6942220	I suggest you
6942220	6944220	Go to YouTube
6948220	6950220	Lastly
6950220	6952220	I'll end the meeting here
6952220	6954220	But we can continue
6954220	6956220	To ask questions
6958220	6960220	I'll bother the teacher
6960220	6962220	Until she can't
6962220	6964220	Because there are too many questions
6964220	6966220	If I can't, I'll
6966220	6968220	That's all
6968220	6970220	Bye
