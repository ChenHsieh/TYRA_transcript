1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello everyone, thank you all for participating in this speech from different cities around the world.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you very much for the detailed introduction just now.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What I want to introduce today is what I want to talk about my research and what I did in the past.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then there are one or two slides to bring a little bit about how I plan to do this topic in the future.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
For the overview part, I will try to use the Chinese slides and the Chinese way to do the speech.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For the more detailed research part, I will try to speak in Chinese, but I will use English slides.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because I'm not so confident in Chinese translation.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But I will try to introduce it to you in Chinese.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I also know that the background of the speakers and the audience is not the same.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So if you have any questions, you are welcome to interrupt me.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then we can go back and forth once or twice.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you find that there are still some problems that cannot be solved, then we can do some more in-depth discussions at the end.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What I want to discuss today is the impact of mechanics on the instability of dyeing.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Especially when looking at this problem from the perspective of cell division.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We know that we learn a lot of loss division from high school and high school biology.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Loss division usually means that when a cell produces a tissue, both sides of the cell will have the same number of dyes.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me quickly go through the process of loss division.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In the process of cell division, the dye will become this shape.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a bit like a sausage.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you fix it in the way of dyeing and look at it with a microscope, you will find that it looks a bit like two sausages.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In the process, the membrane will begin to decompose.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In the process of decomposition, the dye will begin to form the so-called epithelium.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This epithelium will try to form the shape of this epithelium.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In the process, the dye will interact with the epithelium.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The dye will be brought to the center by the epithelium.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's call it neutralization.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There is a very important component called the connective core.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Connective core means that the dye will react with the epithelium at this point.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When the dye is well arranged in the middle, the cells will enter the so-called anaphase.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At this time, the dye will be divided into two sides.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This process is actually very difficult.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Many people are discussing why this process can be so perfect.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There are two things that I must highlight.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The so-called spindle assembly checkpoint.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This checkpoint is a checkpoint signal.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When the dye is not connected to the spindle, the checkpoint will be turned on.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
When this signal is turned on, the cells will not be able to go down.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is the concept of a checkerboard.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If the checkerboard finds that the system is a little problematic, it will try not to let this happen.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There is another system called error correction.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's call it the error correction mechanism.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This error correction mechanism is that when it finds that the dye is not arranged like this,

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There is a set of error correction mechanisms in our cells that try to arrange it correctly.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In this way, when it enters the process of cell division, there will be no errors.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But in fact, there are many times when there are so-called errors.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's call it abnormal division.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In the process of abnormal division, the dye will be unstable.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let me give you an example.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have two sets of dyes here.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I color-coded them.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can see that these two sets of dyes are all connected to the same side.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The other side is not connected.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So you can imagine this process.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If it passes through the post-division and then divides into two cells,

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The dye of the two cells will have different numbers.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We call it aneuploidy in English.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me check it out.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's called aneuploidy.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's quite strange.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a problem.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There are some problems with aneuploidy.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For example, if the number of dyes is increasing, it may be able to express more things.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If there is one more or one less dye,

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is there no way for some proteins to increase or decrease?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This will cause some problems.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In recent years, some people have been discussing this problem.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is the so-called homeostasis problem.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Another problem is that the dye is labeled in red.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In fact, this problem is more serious.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
In this case, this aneuploidy will connect two different cells.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
By the way, this aneuploidy is not only one-to-one.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because there are hundreds of proteins on the aneuploidy.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It also has dozens of proteins that can interact with the aneuploid.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So some aneuploid proteins may be connected to the aneuploid on the other side.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Some will be connected to the aneuploid on the left.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If this aneuploid is connected to this red situation,

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In the process of separation, you can imagine that

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Because the aneuploid usually has a pull force to pull the two aneuploids apart.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If this red one is not eliminated,

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In other words, if the error correction is not done well,

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then this red aneuploid can't run normally to this group.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then it is incorporated into a homo.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So at this time we call it a lagging chromosome.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because it runs slower.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's special about this lagging chromosome?

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In fact, many people have been studying this problem in the past ten years.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because this lagging chromosome can't get into the main homo.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So the cells will automatically produce a small homo around it.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We call it a micronucleotide.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you really look at some of its biochemical properties,

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Or the properties of cell biology,

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You will find that it is very different from the original homo.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It has a lot of holes.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It has a lot of holes, which means that many enzymes in many cells

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Or these messages can run into this homo.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then go to decompose this protein.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is actually a very typical immune response in our cells.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If we encounter this problem, we can find a way to...

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, our cells may have some...

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because usually if you look at the cell membrane,

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you see some double-stranded DNA in the cell tissue,

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then we all think that it may be a virus.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So some of our cells will have some reactions,

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Will try to cut these abnormal double-stranded DNA.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So in theory, this cell will be cleared.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But if this cell survives,

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Those cut off oxidants may be regrouped.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then there will be a lot of mutations.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So the people in this field feel that

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If this cell survives, there will be serious mutations.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is the cancer cell going to use this method to increase its genetic diversity?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is a big topic in the field at present.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, let me talk about some of the classic problems of cell division.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
First, how does the instability of the cancer cell affect the occurrence of cancer?

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I said last time that

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The instability of the cancer cell can make some cancer cells regroup.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It can promote the genetic diversity of tumor cells.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It sounds like the instability of the cancer cell is good.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But we found out again that it's not us.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The research field found that

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If your cancer cell is too unstable,

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It will lead to some signal of cell division.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The cancer cell can't increase its genetic diversity.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because it's all dead.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So there are some ideas in this field.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is there a so-called Achilles heel?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's the heel of Achilles.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Cancer cells can use CIN to increase its genetic diversity.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But if you give it too much CIN,

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Cancer cells are not so happy.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Does this tell us some

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Potential therapeutic strategies?

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If we can make the entire baseline

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If the cancer cell becomes very unstable,

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Is there a chance to find a way to kill this cancer?

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Give a very typical example.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For example, we now know that the acupuncture point is a chemotherapy drug.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Acupuncture point

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cells may feel that

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It may cause these so-called

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A bunch of

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The problem of cancer cell division

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So there will be some instability of the cancer cell.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Of course, this is the current idea of ​​the cellist.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So true or false

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There are still a lot of hypotheses to verify.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I'm probably talking to you today.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The idea is probably like this.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The second question is

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How do cancer cells produce unstable cancer cells?

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you look at the ACS or AAC website,

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You will find that those cancer cells

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Or tumor cells, that is, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In fact, it seems that they are mainly not in the process of cell division.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If it is not in the process of cell division,

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How does it cause cell division?

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This is very paradoxical.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So our idea is

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Will there be other ways besides genes?

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Will it lead to the instability of the cancer cell?

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
After my doctor,

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What I'm doing next

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mainly discussing

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Does chemistry affect the instability of the cancer cell?

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If you have any questions, you can interrupt me at any time.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
First give an overview

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There will be a lot of changes in chemistry during the tumor.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have listed four possible points of change here.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't talk too much because this is what I'm doing.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But I will try to connect what I used to do.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For example, in the process of cancer cells,

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In fact, it is with its neighbor,

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The force of contact with the cell next to it will begin to decrease.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then, the tumor will begin to accumulate some so-called cells near it.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So the tumor will begin to mutate.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then, in the process of cell division,

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This cell will also begin to mutate.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There are three obvious chemical changes in the process of tumor development.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In addition, for example, like the liver cell.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's change the system a little bit.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In addition to the process of tumor development,

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In addition to the mutation of cells,

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sometimes a lot of liver cells accumulate some fat.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This fat is obvious.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
For example, in the process of fatty liver,

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The liver will accumulate some fat.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then we want to say,

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For example, some so-called changes in the nature of cells,

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Will it cause some changes in the chemistry of the entire cell?

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And thus cause an unstable cancer cell.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How do I think about this problem?

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I use this New York magazine cover as a comparison.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We know that cell division,

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I just talked about a lot of processes that are related to the body.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How do we think about this problem?

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because we study cell division.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Our perspective is the same as this New Yorker.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is New York 40 years ago,

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
New York 45 years ago.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The New Yorker's idea is like this.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I live in the egg yolk area.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Many buildings near the egg yolk area,

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Many sell some desserts,

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Of course I know.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
After a while,

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe it's a little bit of a little bit of a place.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then go a little further,

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Passing the Hudson River,

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't seem to care about other places in the United States.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Especially after the Pacific Ocean,

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There are still many strange countries.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It has nothing to do with my life.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not talking about New York.

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I mean,

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Our cell biology is also like this.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I am now studying the process of cell division.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Of course I care about the oxidant.

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's related to the oxidant.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For example, the point of interference,

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Those things.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It may be very important.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I may know him a little bit.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This spindle pole seems to be a little bit important.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a little bit less important.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then I...

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, let's take a look at it.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like Cortex,

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Extracellular Matrix,

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Far away,

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe I don't have to look at it at all.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
At least in the past few years,

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Everyone is not so serious about this thing.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
One of the reasons is because it's too far away.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Another point is because this system is in

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ah, the area below this area is already complicated enough.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to add these things.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe this system can't go either.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Ah, you can't get one either.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Some conclusions.

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But now the technology has advanced.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm starting to know that

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In fact, the

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's what I'm going to talk about next.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In order to make this

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Cellular matrix,

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What about the matrix?

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey, I especially want to focus on this so-called

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Because there are a lot of proteins on the spindle itself.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Spindle itself will also produce force.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So we want to say,

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, if there's a force here,

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Will it be a very interesting and efficient system?

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can let

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do some communication between the cells and the cells.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As a result, it affects the split of the protein.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, now I'm going to start talking.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm really studying the subject.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ah, start with the English title.

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So I want to introduce the so-called

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ah.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The intersection point.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Between the two intersections.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In fact, there is a so-called tension between it.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What about this tension?

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We call it Interconnection Tension.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It is a very important signal.

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What about this signal?

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Ah, you can tell the cells.

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, is this dyeing body correct?

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Align.

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Or is it aligned?

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is it aligned with a block?

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So,

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Ah,

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Cells,

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Ah,

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So,

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can imagine it as a dyeing body.

279
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's a kind of spring.

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There is a kind of spring between the two.

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Between these two intersections.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's because the matrix is pulling it.

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So if it's lined up very well,

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It will pull more.

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What if it's him?

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If it's not lined up,

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's because he.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
For example, like this one.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The matrix is all on the same side.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Then he might be on both sides.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It will be closer.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What about this one that is closer to the distance?

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey, or is this force bigger?

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Or is it smaller?

295
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can tell us the cells.

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey, is this dyeing body the correct arrangement?

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Or is it a wrong arrangement?

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ah, this is from the cells.

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Know that this is right.

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is wrong.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What about it?

302
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then he will use a system.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ah, there are actually many systems.

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But the main system is the so-called Aurora B.

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Kines.

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This system.

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What about Kines?

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Kines is a phosphatidylmethane.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That is, it can be added to the protein.

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Phosphatidylmethane.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Phosphatidylmethane.

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What about this?

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If you add phosphatidylmethane to it,

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hey, you'll find that this is the point.

315
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The interaction between that matrix seems to be weak.

316
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So the idea.

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So the whole.

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Ah, the so-called spirit of the error correction.

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's like this.

320
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That is to say.

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hey, this place is wrong.

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then I'll try to get it out.

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
After that?

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This dye system can be rearranged again.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ah, if there is still a problem.

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's do it again.

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That until the whole system is well arranged.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
After that, the cells can say.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, let's keep going.

330
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay, that's the so-called regulation.

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's just call it upstream regulation model.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That is.

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Li Li?

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Become a upstream control mechanism.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tell the cells that this place should be corrected.

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This place may be good.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then we don't have to correct it.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay, of course, behind this area.

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In the past 20 years.

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A lot of people have been thinking about this issue.

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That is to say.

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hey, why is that?

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This force will cause.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It can be a signal.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Then tell the cells that this is right or wrong.

346
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
For example.

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hey, maybe after you pull it away.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's that?

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because the original B is in the middle.

350
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So it's not easy to follow.

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Pulled away from the dye.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Pulled away from the left point to do some interaction.

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Or maybe after you pull it away.

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There is a force, and then the force changes some protein structures.

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So I can't do it.

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This left point is a lot, a lot, a lot.

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In the past 20 years.

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
A lot of reviews.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A lot of research articles.

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
They're all looking at this mechanism.

361
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ah, if you're interested.

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You can refer to me.

363
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I wrote a review with my post-doc mentor.

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Ah, this review is mainly summarized.

365
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Let me advertise.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This review is mainly summarized.

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That is.

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How do we use some chemical methods.

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
To understand the process of cell division.

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Ah, there are some interesting ones.

371
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The use is from a lot of different research.

372
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They have some very insightful uses.

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So you can refer to it.

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Good.

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Of course, the Austrian Regulation Model is great.

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But he also has some problems that can't be solved.

377
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
For example.

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hey.

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Like this at the beginning.

380
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You have to say, hey, if he opens this.

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Ah.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He has some problems that can't be solved.

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
For example, hey, how does he dye.

384
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If he doesn't have no interest.

385
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It will fall off.

386
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How did he go?

387
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ah.

388
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How did he start to do interaction with the anti-water?

389
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because at the beginning of the interaction, the force was also very small.

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So the force is also very small.

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That is, by definition, this should also fall off.

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So.

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So there will be a so-called paradox like this.

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The other point is that there is another mistake.

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Like I said at the beginning of the time.

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This focus point will be connected to different levels on both sides.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That.

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ah.

399
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We don't know if this interest is.

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How to deal with this problem.

401
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Good.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So there are a lot of problems.

403
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Austrian Regulation Model will have some problems.

404
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Of course, he solved a big problem.

405
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That.

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So we put forward a hypothesis at this time.

407
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That is to say, hey.

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Will it be a downstream control signal?

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Because the whole field is looking at his upstream control signal.

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then we say, hey.

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Is it possible to become a downstream control signal?

412
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
To affect the function of Aurora B?

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Good.

414
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then we have to know the function of Aurora B.

415
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We have to know first.

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Is he a downstream signal?

417
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We have to know what the Aurora B function is.

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There are currently two models being proposed.

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is what Aurora B can do.

420
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The first model.

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Everyone is.

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Conceptually, everyone thinks he is right.

423
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is the so-called Release Model.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This Release Model tells us.

425
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If Aurora B.

426
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
After the loss point is optimized.

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This hammer will fall off.

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So after he fell off.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey, look at this.

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The loss point is empty, right?

431
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What if it's empty?

432
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That.

433
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He can connect.

434
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Have the opportunity to connect.

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The hammer that came out on the other side.

436
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey.

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If this system is effective.

438
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then he can.

439
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Quickly become a symmetrical array.

440
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This model is very powerful.

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The biggest problem is that there is no direct.

442
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The evidence of cellular biology.

443
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Confirm that this release model exists.

444
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So, uh.

445
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Since there is no evidence, let's just say it.

446
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That a lot of.

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Uh.

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Protein storage system.

449
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Invisible system.

450
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In fact, it tells me that there is a hint that this should be right.

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But.

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Cellular biology has not really made it yet.

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This.

454
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This model.

455
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What about cellular biology?

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There are different models of life.

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It has been proven that there are diplomacy models.

458
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a bit special.

459
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's a bit complicated.

460
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This model is to say.

461
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey, if this.

462
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What happens after the left point is oxidized?

463
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This.

464
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
B, he will lower this.

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The so-called lowering of this hammer.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In the process of lowering.

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This dye will also move to spinopo.

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When he moves to spinopo.

469
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What about this spinopo?

470
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are some enzymes near spinopo.

471
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
For example, A is a good brother of B.

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He will be responsible for it.

473
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That is.

474
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is to find a way to put.

475
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Uh.

476
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This is the point of contact with the water.

477
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The interaction is eliminated.

478
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So in this model.

479
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's also very complicated.

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This model basically tells us.

481
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What about the Aurora B?

482
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mainly let.

483
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The dye is moving.

484
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's not used to do error correction.

485
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So the Aurora A is the error correction.

486
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This.

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
With the beginning.

488
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's just that everyone's idea is not very good.

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because everyone knows that the Aurora B is the same.

490
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There should be a problem in theory.

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Because otherwise.

492
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This is the reason.

493
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think.

494
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The Aurora B is to do error correction.

495
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But.

496
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is the model.

497
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This model.

498
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
More.

499
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Uh.

500
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Some evidence in cell biology.

501
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay, so what about our project?

502
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There are two models.

503
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then we want to know.

504
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The first model.

505
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Does this release model exist?

506
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The second.

507
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Physics is.

508
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is it possible to control these two different.

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Uh, function.

510
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In order to do this.

511
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Our most direct idea is.

512
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then we put the Aurora B.

513
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
See if you can stick it to the point of contact.

514
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then see how it works.

515
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How does this cell deal with this problem?

516
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How to connect the Aurora B directly to the point of contact?

517
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We have this chemical optogenetic system.

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This system has three components.

519
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The first one is.

520
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This probe has three components.

521
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The first one is that it has a halo ligand.

522
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It can interact with halo tag protein.

523
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It has another TMP ligand.

524
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It can interact with DHFR tag.

525
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So in theory.

526
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
After these two probes are added.

527
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This DHFR protein will be connected to the halo tag protein.

528
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Then the two of them can do something.

529
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
In order to increase the time and space of special temporal control.

530
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We added a cage on this TMP.

531
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So the reason for this cage is.

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hey, look at the cage.

533
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So this pink can't bite this pink.

534
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Uh, peanuts.

535
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Then.

536
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
When I use light to put it on this cage.

537
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This one.

538
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He can go to him.

539
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Then at this time we can use light to control.

540
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Interaction with this protein.

541
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then I just said that my main job.

542
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The job is to connect that Aura B to the core.

543
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So of course I hope to put this piece on Aura B.

544
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This piece is connected to the core.

545
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I use this system.

546
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Ah, we put this so-called.

547
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Ah, this tag.

548
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This so-called Aura B activator is called INBOX.

549
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He is a.

550
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He is an Aura B activator anyway.

551
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Then in order to put this Aura B.

552
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Aura B is connected to this.

553
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ah.

554
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Outside the point.

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Then we put this point on top of it.

556
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We chose this.

557
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We put HaloTag on this so-called.

558
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ah.

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
SPC25.

560
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He is a point of contact protein.

561
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What about doing this?

562
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We can do it in a short time.

563
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In about a few ten seconds.

564
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Aura B is connected to the so-called.

565
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Ah, the point of contact.

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Then we can see.

567
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Hey, how do the cells deal with this problem?

568
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We.

569
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay, so the first one I'm doing is.

570
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then let's take a look at Aura B.

571
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If we connect to the point of contact.

572
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's take a look at that.

573
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Ah, if the point of contact is selected.

574
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If the force is very.

575
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If the force is very low.

576
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's see.

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How do the cells deal with this problem?

578
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What about this reflector?

579
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's actually a dynamic balance.

580
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The.

581
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
In this case.

582
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He is a dynamic balance.

583
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The process.

584
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Ah.

585
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I should introduce this system.

586
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This system.

587
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I put this.

588
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Ah, this.

589
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah.

590
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Separated cells.

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Add a so-called.

592
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This.

593
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Ah, this is a very powerful inhibitor.

594
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is a very powerful inhibitor.

595
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
After this inhibitor is added.

596
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
This cell will form these two.

597
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The two will not be separated again.

598
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It will form.

599
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A very star-shaped.

600
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
A reflector.

601
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What about this reflector?

602
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Ah, this dye is on top of it.

603
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He will.

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He is his position.

605
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It is a dynamic.

606
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
His.

607
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The connection of the reflector.

608
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He will pull him.

609
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But there are some proteins on his dye.

610
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
For example.

611
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
These motor proteins.

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He will pull him out.

613
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So in theory.

614
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Ah.

615
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This dye is a.

616
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ah.

617
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
A reflector process.

618
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's why he's going to be here.

619
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So if I put this Aurora B thing.

620
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Stick to.

621
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
This place.

622
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If Aurora B Trigger.

623
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Ah.

624
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This.

625
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ah.

626
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The point of focus and the reflector.

627
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That is, if he falls off.

628
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What about this time?

629
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You will win.

630
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So he will.

631
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This.

632
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You will find out.

633
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey.

634
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Is the entire dye running out?

635
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Relative.

636
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If he triggers a decay.

637
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's it.

638
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Because we know that the reflector decays.

639
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Will produce a lot of pull.

640
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That.

641
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So.

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If he triggers a decay.

643
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That.

644
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
At this time.

645
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
This dye should pull inwards.

646
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So we can start.

647
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Ah.

648
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The dye is going out.

649
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Or go inside.

650
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
To explore.

651
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Which model is right.

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ah.

653
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is our experiment process.

654
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Is.

655
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Hey.

656
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is.

657
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
For example.

658
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This channel on the left.

659
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Is a.

660
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Ah.

661
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Is.

662
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The so-called.

663
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Point of focus and.

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I.

665
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I also labeled.

666
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That spindle pole.

667
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
On the right.

668
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Is.

669
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He can activate.

670
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That.

671
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
At the time equal to zero.

672
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You will find that.

673
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Hey.

674
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This one.

675
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The system.

676
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That he.

677
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
In the signal inside.

678
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
In fact, it is quite uniform.

679
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But after t equals zero.

680
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If you activate this.

681
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Cell.

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You will find that.

683
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey.

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Aurora B or Inbox.

686
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He.

687
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Inbox or Aurora B.

688
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He will stick directly to this point of focus.

689
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
In a minute.

690
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This phenomenon can be completed.

691
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That.

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You find that.

693
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey.

694
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
After he stuck it up.

695
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The whole point of focus.

696
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Go inside.

697
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Okay.

698
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So.

699
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey.

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We put.

701
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We.

702
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Uh.

703
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Collect a lot of data.

704
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Data.

705
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Data.

706
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Then we found that.

707
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hey.

708
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In fact.

709
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Most of the cells.

710
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
In fact, they all run inwards.

711
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Ah.

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Here.

713
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Uh.

714
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Coordinate.

715
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
A little change.

716
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It means going up.

717
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Ah.

718
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
In a minute.

719
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because.

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
In order to match the data afterwards.

721
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So.

722
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You will find that.

723
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hey.

724
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Aurora B.

725
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
He will let the cells.

726
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Ah.

727
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This mk14.

728
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
mk14.

729
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He is a.

730
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Ah.

731
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It will decouple.

732
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
One of the anti-Claustrophobic enzymes.

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I put.

734
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I recoup mk.

735
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Because he is.

736
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Then he.

737
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Also.

738
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Also run inwards.

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So.

740
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If recoup Aurora B.

741
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
With recoup mk.

742
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Tell us.

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Similar.

744
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If the phenomenon.

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Then I can say.

746
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hey.

747
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Aurora B.

748
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Is not it.

749
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Is caused.

750
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Anti-Claustrophobic decoupling.

751
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So.

752
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It seems to be more correct.

753
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
At least in this.

754
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
He can also.

755
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Be born.

756
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Because he can decouple anti-Claustrophobic.

757
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
In fact, he can also be used.

758
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
To control some anti-Claustrophobic.

759
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That.

760
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is also my future.

761
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I plan to use this system.

762
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
To.

763
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
To explore some cells.

764
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This is anti-Claustrophobic.

765
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Some problems in mechanics.

766
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But anyway.

767
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This is our current.

768
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No need to discuss this mk problem.

769
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay.

770
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So.

771
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The second.

772
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I want to say.

773
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hey.

774
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Then I know.

775
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Aurora B.

776
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Will deploy.

777
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Then.

778
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
If.

779
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
My second question is.

780
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Hey.

781
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If in.

782
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Ah.

783
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Aurora B.

784
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Will do the same thing?

785
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That.

786
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In order to explore this problem.

787
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I want to put Aurora B.

788
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Stick to.

789
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
A.

790
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hammer.

791
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Ah.

792
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Stick to a.

793
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
On the point.

794
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Another point.

795
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't want to stick to it.

796
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Then you can imagine.

797
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If Aurora B.

798
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Trigger.

799
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Release.

800
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Then.

801
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
At this time.

802
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The other side of the.

803
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That.

804
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The anti-Claustrophobic.

805
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Will pull the entire dye body to the other side.

806
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That.

807
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Relative.

808
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If.

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He triggered.

810
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Deformation.

811
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Then.

812
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's the same.

813
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
From the direction.

814
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We can.

815
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
To explore.

816
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Which model.

817
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Is right.

818
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

819
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This is our example.

820
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You can also look at this video.

821
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So it's the same.

822
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
At the same time.

823
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Hey.

824
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This.

825
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Aurora B.

826
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's a.

827
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Ah.

828
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Even distribution.

829
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
At the same time.

830
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm going to figure out a way to.

831
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Stick Aurora B.

832
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
To this one.

833
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You.

834
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You should be able to see this.

835
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
There are two.

836
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This is possible.

837
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Then I'll figure out a way to stick this one.

838
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The point.

839
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That.

840
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Hey.

841
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
About.

842
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
A minute.

843
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Less than a minute.

844
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The signal is saturated.

845
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
After that, you'll find out.

846
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hey.

847
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In fact, this.

848
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Uh.

849
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The dye.

850
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He didn't run away right away.

851
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He's still there.

852
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
After two or three minutes.

853
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Slowly.

854
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Run over.

855
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Hey.

856
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So tell us.

857
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Hey.

858
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It seems to be released.

859
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It seems to fit better.

860
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Is.

861
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
After you hit it.

862
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It seems that he ran to the other side.

863
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So it seems to be released.

864
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
More correct.

865
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That.

866
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I put it.

867
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I.

868
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We.

869
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Let's take a look at 1m.

870
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
When this.

871
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The dye.

872
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
After leaving this middle plate.

873
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's fix this cell.

874
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Then we take it to 1m.

875
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's take a look at the bottom.

876
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Hey.

877
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Is it.

878
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
On both sides.

879
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Is it.

880
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Uh.

881
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is it.

882
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is it.

883
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Uh.

884
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Is it.

885
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is it.

886
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is it.

887
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Is it.

888
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Is it.

889
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Is it.

890
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Is it.

891
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Is it.

892
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is it.

893
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Is it.

894
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Is it.

895
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Is it.

896
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Is it.

897
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Is it.

898
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is it.

899
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Is there a waterproofing on both sides of the magnetic point?

900
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Then we found that if this.

901
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Magnetism.

902
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Ah.

903
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If this magnetic point is connected to Aurora B.

904
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hey.

905
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There is no magnetism above.

906
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
But if the other side, I did not activate it.

907
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That.

908
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So he doesn't have it up there.

909
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Aurora B.

910
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There are more than a dozen.

911
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Several.

912
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
There are more than a dozen.

913
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Ah.

914
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ah.

915
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The so-called magnetism.

916
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That.

917
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Here is only one slide.

918
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
As it is only about 5.

919
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But there are other times.

920
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There are other.

921
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The.

922
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The.

923
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So hey.

924
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So Aurora B.

925
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Activation.

926
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It will really cause release.

927
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
At least in this case.

928
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay.

929
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Then you may find out.

930
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Hey.

931
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It seems that I found two different.

932
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Ah.

933
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Mouth to mouth.

934
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is.

935
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Found two different.

936
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Function.

937
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So how do we discuss.

938
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You see in the monopole spindle.

939
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It seems to be a trigger.

940
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Deprecation.

941
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But in.

942
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
High tension or bipolar spindle.

943
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It triggers release.

944
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So we started to think.

945
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Hey.

946
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is it.

947
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Magnetism.

948
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Ah.

949
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
What about the magnetic force on the magnetic point?

950
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Will tell Aurora B.

951
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
To do this.

952
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll explain to you guys later.

953
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Ah.

954
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay.

955
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
For.

956
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Explore this.

957
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Is this the problem of tension?

958
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Then I just wanted to say.

959
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Hey.

960
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let's use a.

961
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Use some chemical drugs to go.

962
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Ah.

963
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
To change his.

964
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Ah.

965
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Tension.

966
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So let's use these two.

967
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Inhibitor.

968
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
These two.

969
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
For.

970
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You'll find out.

971
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The distance from his defective point.

972
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Lower.

973
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
OK, tell me.

974
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's what tells me that the tension is getting smaller.

975
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Then we want to say.

976
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
When he was small, we sat on the same.

977
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Do it again at the same time.

978
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
See if it gets the same different result.

979
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then our idea is to say.

980
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Hey, I'm going to make this tension smaller.

981
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Is that not.

982
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This release.

983
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Will be.

984
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's not easy to happen.

985
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Ah.

986
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What about here?

987
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I did some tricks.

988
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Because we.

989
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We know that this inhibitor.

990
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He.

991
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It may also affect the department.

992
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's just two at the same time.

993
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So we want to see.

994
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Ah.

995
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Explore a little more detailed.

996
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's just that we look directly at the release.

997
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
This.

998
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Condition.

999
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So we want to measure directly.

1000
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Release.

1001
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Some kinetics.

1002
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So how do we measure release?

1003
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Kinetics?

1004
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We know that.

1005
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This.

1006
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like I just said.

1007
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That is, if I hit the dot.

1008
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
After that.

1009
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This dot will be here.

1010
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Stop here.

1011
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Stop for a while.

1012
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Then start to go in the other direction.

1013
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So I just put this.

1014
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Ah.

1015
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This.

1016
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Trace it.

1017
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Record it.

1018
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You will find that it is probably like this.

1019
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What about the beginning?

1020
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
When there is no fire.

1021
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The two sides are symmetrical.

1022
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But in the process of the process.

1023
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey.

1024
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The other side is gone.

1025
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So he's on the other side of the sea.

1026
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Go.

1027
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Then go to the end.

1028
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He will be near the extreme.

1029
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Stop near the back.

1030
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This waiting time.

1031
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Here.

1032
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Tell us.

1033
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Hey.

1034
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This waiting time.

1035
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Here.

1036
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Tell us.

1037
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Very useful information.

1038
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Because.

1039
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If this waiting time.

1040
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
If it's too long.

1041
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It means that the effect of Orabi.

1042
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The efficiency is not very strong.

1043
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Hey.

1044
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That waiting time is short.

1045
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It means that the effect of Orabi.

1046
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The efficiency is very strong.

1047
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Then I just put this waiting time.

1048
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
After collecting it.

1049
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Then I took a look.

1050
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is there a case of medicine?

1051
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
There is medicine.

1052
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Is.

1053
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The force is relatively low.

1054
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No medicine.

1055
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
When the force is stronger.

1056
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Then we found out.

1057
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hey.

1058
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Add medicine.

1059
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This is.

1060
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Or.

1061
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
When the force is lower.

1062
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Ah.

1063
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The effect of Orabi is worse.

1064
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
When there is no medicine.

1065
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is.

1066
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
When the force is stronger.

1067
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Hey.

1068
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
His waiting time is shorter.

1069
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Tell me.

1070
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He is faster.

1071
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So we know that.

1072
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Hey.

1073
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If the force becomes smaller.

1074
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He will let.

1075
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The release.

1076
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The kinetics becomes slower.

1077
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Okay.

1078
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Today.

1079
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Give you a summary.

1080
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That is to say.

1081
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Hey.

1082
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We.

1083
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This.

1084
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Work.

1085
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Get a.

1086
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Result.

1087
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That is to say.

1088
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We think that.

1089
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The dye makes the force.

1090
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
In addition to becoming an upstream signal.

1091
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It can also become a downstream signal.

1092
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He will release the microchip.

1093
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Just try to find a way.

1094
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The left point will leave with the anti-slip.

1095
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In addition.

1096
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He will also reduce.

1097
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Ah.

1098
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Anti-slip.

1099
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Then we found that.

1100
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
In a situation where the force is very strong.

1101
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Hey.

1102
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Orabi will let the left point go.

1103
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Ah.

1104
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Go with the anti-slip.

1105
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Leave.

1106
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Go.

1107
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Combine.

1108
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That in.

1109
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
In a situation where the force is very low.

1110
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Orabi will be more inclined to go.

1111
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Ah.

1112
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Go.

1113
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Reduce this anti-slip.

1114
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Ah.

1115
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then we.

1116
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
From a cell biology perspective.

1117
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
How do we explain this phenomenon?

1118
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We know that.

1119
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
There are two wrong ways in the cell.

1120
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The same.

1121
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The left point can be connected.

1122
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Ah.

1123
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
These two left points can be connected to the same.

1124
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Ah.

1125
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Binopole.

1126
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Ah.

1127
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What if.

1128
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Orabi.

1129
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
At this time, the cell has a problem.

1130
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The cell found that there was a problem with this dye.

1131
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Hey.

1132
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
He will recruit Orabi.

1133
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Then at this time.

1134
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He will deploy microtubules.

1135
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
At this time.

1136
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The dye can run to the pore.

1137
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
In this case.

1138
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It can be immediately.

1139
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Directly.

1140
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Transmitted to.

1141
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
In the middle of the cell.

1142
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So it will be arranged.

1143
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
A little faster.

1144
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This is on the kinetic.

1145
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
There will be some advantages.

1146
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That is, the cell biology.

1147
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But.

1148
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Another wrong way is like this.

1149
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
This is a more serious mistake.

1150
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It is a left point to connect two.

1151
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Ah.

1152
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Binopoles.

1153
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This.

1154
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What about this situation?

1155
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
We found that.

1156
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Hey.

1157
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
In fact.

1158
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It seems like.

1159
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If you buy these three.

1160
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If it's the same thing.

1161
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
In fact, it seems that there is no way to solve this problem.

1162
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What about in this system?

1163
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Because we think.

1164
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey.

1165
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Is it.

1166
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
His tension is higher.

1167
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So, in fact, this.

1168
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Mistake.

1169
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Attachment.

1170
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
In fact, it is in the way of release.

1171
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
To relax.

1172
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You can also do this.

1173
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You can do this.

1174
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You can do this.

1175
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The wrong way.

1176
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Cut it off.

1177
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
After?

1178
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
He.

1179
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This system can become.

1180
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The normal.

1181
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Uh.

1182
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Process.

1183
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So, we think that zhang li.

1184
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Ah.

1185
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
A very important.

1186
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
A signal of downstream control.

1187
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Tell the cell.

1188
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
To do this.

1189
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Or do this.

1190
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Ah.

1191
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
In addition.

1192
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We can also explain.

1193
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Other problems that can not be explained.

1194
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Like I just said.

1195
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Hey.

1196
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I want to dye.

1197
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
How did it start?

1198
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Connect.

1199
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Connect the.

1200
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The.

1201
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That according to the past.

1202
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The idea is to say.

1203
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Hey.

1204
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If he.

1205
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Orabi.

1206
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
When the fire is very high.

1207
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
He should fall off.

1208
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But we.

1209
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We can find out.

1210
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Hey.

1211
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
In fact, he may not fall.

1212
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Because at this time.

1213
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You can also know that he is very low.

1214
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He.

1215
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He doesn't have any tension.

1216
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So.

1217
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
After he connected.

1218
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
In fact, he is not so easy to fall off.

1219
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So.

1220
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
This.

1221
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We just.

1222
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Somehow.

1223
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That is.

1224
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Resolve this problem.

1225
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Hey.

1226
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I just talked about this.

1227
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
If you have this.

1228
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Cell.

1229
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Uh.

1230
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If you are interested in the micro-surgery.

1231
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey.

1232
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You are welcome to refer to my article.

1233
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

1234
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Just released today.

1235
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay.

1236
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So.

1237
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We know that the changes in the mechanics of the cells.

1238
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It will affect the instability of the dye.

1239
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So my main topic now.

1240
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It is to discuss that the skin.

1241
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uh.

1242
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Just like I just said.

1243
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That is.

1244
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The cancerous process of the skin cell.

1245
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
In the process of cancer cells.

1246
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
In fact, there are some changes in the mechanics.

1247
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Then we think.

1248
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Hey.

1249
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
For example.

1250
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Cell.

1251
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I just said.

1252
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Or the tension between the cell and the tissue becomes smaller.

1253
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Then everyone already knows that this process.

1254
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It may cause an instability of the dye.

1255
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Then let's think about it.

1256
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Hey.

1257
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I just explained it.

1258
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That is.

1259
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Cell.

1260
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The tension in the micro-surgery will also cause problems.

1261
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The tension outside the cell will also cause problems.

1262
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Then we think.

1263
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Hey.

1264
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The tension inside the cell and outside the cell.

1265
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Is there a certain degree of coupling?

1266
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The so-called connection.

1267
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Okay.

1268
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The other question is.

1269
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey.

1270
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
What about the division cell?

1271
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I said.

1272
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It.

1273
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It usually becomes harder.

1274
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What about the cell tissue?

1275
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It also becomes more.

1276
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The cell tissue also becomes harder.

1277
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then we want to say.

1278
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Is this process?

1279
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The hardening process of cell division.

1280
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It can help this cancer cell.

1281
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In.

1282
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
In this harder environment.

1283
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You can go.

1284
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
To split.

1285
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Because we also know that.

1286
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
If you go to suppress this cell.

1287
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You find out that he.

1288
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's like.

1289
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The dye can't be arranged in the middle plate.

1290
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So.

1291
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It will cause some split problems.

1292
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So.

1293
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's talk about this.

1294
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Hardening.

1295
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The hardening process of split cells.

1296
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
From whether or not.

1297
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Let the cells grow in this harder environment.

1298
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
This question is more like.

1299
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The problem of fatty liver.

1300
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That is to say.

1301
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
We hope to know that.

1302
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Uh.

1303
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
In the process of fatty liver or liver hardening.

1304
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Uh.

1305
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The inside of the liver cell will produce a UTI accumulation.

1306
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It will also produce some hardening accumulation on the outside.

1307
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Then we want to say.

1308
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
These so-called constraints inside.

1309
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The outside of this.

1310
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Constraints of cell division.

1311
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Is it possible?

1312
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Is there some interaction?

1313
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Then it leads to the whole.

1314
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The cancer cell becomes the cancer process.

1315
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Of course, there is no so-called.

1316
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The study of the mouth.

1317
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Now I just feel that.

1318
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hey.

1319
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Uh.

1320
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Fat liver.

1321
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Liver hardening liver cancer.

1322
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It seems to be a high-level mouth.

1323
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That.

1324
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So this part is still a bit like open question.

1325
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Uh.

1326
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Ah.

1327
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Then I want to be now.

1328
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That is.

1329
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
This process.

1330
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In fact, there are a lot of people helping me.

1331
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Like, for example.

1332
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Ah.

1333
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Our lab.

1334
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There are two of these.

1335
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
In fact, at the beginning.

1336
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Uh.

1337
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Helped me build a lot of systems.

1338
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So.

1339
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm just a human.

1340
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Will put.

1341
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Put these things in the end.

1342
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
A process.

1343
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Just put it together.

1344
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So.

1345
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I have a lot of credit for this.

1346
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
He.

1347
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He.

1348
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
At least do a lot of work.

1349
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So I.

1350
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Save a lot of time.

1351
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Of course, I also have some work.

1352
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There are some people.

1353
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
For example.

1354
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
He is.

1355
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Do some organic chemistry synthesis.

1356
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He can synthesize those light.

1357
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Some of the light chemistry.

1358
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Uh.

1359
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Materials.

1360
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It can be used to make light.

1361
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Can be used to control.

1362
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That.

1363
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Because I can't do this myself.

1364
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So I have to give them a little credit.

1365
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What about the other one?

1366
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He is in a university in New York.

1367
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ah.

1368
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Then they.

1369
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This lab.

1370
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's amazing.

1371
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What about, uh.

1372
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's amazing to do that.

1373
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's amazing to do that.

1374
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Then we just put our sample.

1375
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
After fixing it.

1376
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And then send it directly to them.

1377
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
They can watch em.

1378
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Then, uh.

1379
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There's always going to be some beautiful results.

1380
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I have to.

1381
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Thank them.

1382
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Of course, this.

1383
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The dust has a very strong.

1384
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Comma members.

1385
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He.

1386
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This.

1387
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Comma has five levels.

1388
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Including our level.

1389
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So these labs.

1390
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Some are doing cell biology.

1391
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Some are doing.

1392
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Ah.

1393
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Some do biochemistry, computer physics.

1394
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
He has done bioengineering.

1395
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Then.

1396
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's discuss the problem of cell division together.

1397
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I think these teams.

1398
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's.

1399
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's.

1400
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's really strong.

1401
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So I, I highly recommend that if you're looking for a blog post.

1402
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You can go to these labs.

1403
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If you're interested in cell division.

1404
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You can come and have a look at the background.

1405
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And of course, there are some so-called, uh.

1406
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's probably what I'm talking about today.

1407
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Thank you.

1408
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
OK.

1409
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Thank you.

1410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Uh, that.

1411
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What's the problem?

1412
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Uh, you still.

1413
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Hey.

1414
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm sorry.

1415
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm sorry.

1416
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm sorry.

1417
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm sorry.

1418
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm sorry.

1419
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm sorry.

1420
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm sorry.

1421
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm sorry.

1422
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm sorry.

1423
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm sorry.

1424
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm sorry.

1425
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm sorry.

1426
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm sorry.

1427
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm sorry.

1428
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sorry.

1429
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm sorry.

1430
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm sorry.

1431
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm sorry.

1432
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm sorry.

1433
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm sorry.

1434
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

1435
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm so sorry.

1436
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm so sorry.

1437
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm so sorry.

1438
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm sorry.

1439
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm sorry.

1440
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm sorry.

1441
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm so sorry.

1442
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm sorry.

1443
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm sorry.

1444
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sorry.

1445
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm sorry.

1446
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm sorry.

1447
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Thank you, thank you.

1448
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Thank you, thank you.

1449
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Thank you.

1450
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Thank you.

1451
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Thank you, thank you.

1452
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Thank you.

1453
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Thank you.

1454
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Thank you.

1455
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Thank you.

1456
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Thank you.

1457
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Thank you.

1458
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So, I wanted to ask this question

1459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
because, around four or five years ago,

1460
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
we saw this phenomenon,

1461
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
especially in myosis.

1462
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's...

1463
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
or, I should say,

1464
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in ogenesis,

1465
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it only has one chromosome

1466
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that goes all the way to the next generation.

1467
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then the rest three are omitted.

1468
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So, you'll drive, right?

1469
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1470
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Only one will remain.

1471
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So, when they're shown in rows,

1472
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
some genes will sense that

1473
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it's arranged in the wrong place,

1474
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and then it will loosen up the whole process

1475
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and start over.

1476
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So, eventually,

1477
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
it has a higher chance

1478
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to reach the next generation.

1479
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1480
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So, I'm curious,

1481
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
in myosis,

1482
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
is there another layer

1483
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to control it?

1484
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Or is it a very different thing?

1485
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes, there is.

1486
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We first...

1487
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
About three or four years ago,

1488
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
there was an article in Science.

1489
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It was written by another Japanese.

1490
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
He mentioned that

1491
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
he used mouse eggs to make the system.

1492
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You know, eggs are also used for myosis.

1493
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
In M1,

1494
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
after myosis,

1495
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
it will be divided into four cells.

1496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
He found that some components

1497
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
will make some of its genes...

1498
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
will make some of the colored cells

1499
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
more flat,

1500
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
or the dead spot is more likely

1501
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to stay in the egg.

1502
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah.

1503
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Then he found some phenomena.

1504
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
For example,

1505
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
for example, the iris

1506
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
will actually have an asymmetry.

1507
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But this may just be the mouse.

1508
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I don't know if there is

1509
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
such a phenomenon in the opposite color.

1510
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But I know the mouse has this.

1511
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Myosis will have additional controls.

1512
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
For example, the iris will have an asymmetry.

1513
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Then its size...

1514
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The size of the left eye

1515
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
will also affect its problem.

1516
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Because the size of the left eye

1517
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
is like what we just talked about.

1518
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
MKEG, Deployment,

1519
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
will also have different activities.

1520
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So myosis is indeed more complicated.

1521
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So now everyone in this field

1522
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
is actually mainly going that way.

1523
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Ah, I can't be a mouse.

1524
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I don't want to be a mouse.

1525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So I didn't go that way.

1526
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I went the other way.

1527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
But your question is very...

1528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
On the point.

1529
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I have to say.

1530
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Thank you.

1531
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
OK.

1532
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Questions?

1533
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Before asking questions,

1534
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
please introduce yourself.

1535
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Everyone knows you.

1536
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I want to ask a question.

1537
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
OK, please say.

1538
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I am an outsider.

1539
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But I still want to ask a question.

1540
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh, OK.

1541
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You just mentioned

1542
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the intercellular and

1543
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
external cells.

1544
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
According to my understanding of intercellular biology,

1545
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
there will be a cell membrane.

1546
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The cell membrane is actually quite strong.

1547
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What is the mechanism for coupling?

1548
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I know that

1549
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
there will be some holes on the surface.

1550
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It will allow some things

1551
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
to enter the cells.

1552
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But I don't know

1553
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
if this thing

1554
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
may be some...

1555
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
There may be substances in it.

1556
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But I don't know

1557
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the coupling of tension.

1558
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What is the possible mechanism?

1559
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This question is really great.

1560
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I have to say this question.

1561
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
In fact, people in this field

1562
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
are thinking very seriously.

1563
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But they have never thought of a way.

1564
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
There is no good mechanism

1565
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
to solve this problem.

1566
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Let me tell you

1567
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
a few possibilities.

1568
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you look at it from the perspective of mechanics.

1569
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Let's say this.

1570
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Someone in my class is doing this.

1571
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That is to say, you know.

1572
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
In fact, the magnet will move.

1573
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And it will swing.

1574
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
This process is because

1575
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
there are some proteins on the cell membrane

1576
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that will pull it.

1577
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
In fact, there are many groups

1578
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
that have been doing this for more than ten years.

1579
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Many engineers have done this.

1580
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They found that

1581
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
if you change the cell tissue on the outside.

1582
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
For example, integrin

1583
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
or those adhesion molecules.

1584
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
In fact, the direction of the magnet

1585
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
will change with the distance.

1586
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Of course, you can ask a question.

1587
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
How did this happen?

1588
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It may happen

1589
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
because these molecules

1590
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
may cause some

1591
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
small molecules to gather.

1592
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The small molecules are not actually magnets.

1593
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's the cortex around it.

1594
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
There is another cytoskeleton on the cortex.

1595
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's called actin.

1596
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It may be in the process of gathering.

1597
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It also gathers those things that will connect to the magnet.

1598
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So it will relatively

1599
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
zoom in on this path.

1600
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This is one possibility.

1601
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Another possibility is

1602
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
some regulations like biochemistry.

1603
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
For example, those molecules

1604
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
will actually induce some

1605
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
message transmission.

1606
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Those message transmissions may make

1607
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
some signals of the entire cell.

1608
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
For example,

1609
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
it may make some

1610
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
places easier to decompose.

1611
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
At this time, the tension will increase.

1612
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So there are some

1613
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of these two models.

1614
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
In fact, everyone doesn't quite understand.

1615
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But I already know that there is such a phenomenon.

1616
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That is to say,

1617
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
what did you change outside?

1618
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
In fact, the spindle pole will change.

1619
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Now our question

1620
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Actually, my question is not very

1621
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
so-called

1622
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
very

1623
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
deep.

1624
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Everyone already knows this process.

1625
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I already know that

1626
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the spindle pole and

1627
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
the magnetic core will be connected.

1628
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I just want to say

1629
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
that these two pieces

1630
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
are not

1631
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
so-called interaction.

1632
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm just

1633
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
adding another layer on that question.

1634
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I hope I have answered your question.

1635
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It seems a bit complicated.

1636
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm not a very good presenter.

1637
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So I try my best.

1638
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
OK.

1639
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Actually, I have another question.

1640
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But

1641
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
let the audience ask first.

1642
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Is there any other questions from the audience on the spot?

1643
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Hello.

1644
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Please say hello.

1645
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I am Zhou Jia.

1646
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I am Zhou Jia.

1647
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I am from Bristol University in the UK.

1648
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I also do cell biology.

1649
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
My own research has touched on some active parts.

1650
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So I'm curious.

1651
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Because in your project,

1652
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you mentioned that

1653
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
the tension between cells

1654
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
will affect

1655
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the performance of magnetism.

1656
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So when you train cells,

1657
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
will you particularly consider using

1658
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
some different software?

1659
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Or

1660
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
will you specifically set

1661
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the confluence of specific cells?

1662
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
In fact, maybe cell contact or no contact

1663
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
may affect the performance of some cells.

1664
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Because when I do experiments myself,

1665
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I seem to encounter this kind of trouble.

1666
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yes. OK.

1667
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I have to say that

1668
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
when you were doing cell experiments in the past,

1669
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
let me tell you first.

1670
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
There are several points to discuss.

1671
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The first point

1672
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
is what cells are different and what cells are not different.

1673
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I believe that different cells will have different differences.

1674
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Because what we use is

1675
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
what I just said

1676
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
outside will affect inside

1677
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
that cell

1678
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is actually the primary cell.

1679
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This is the mouse's membrane cell.

1680
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Then it is raised in 3D culture.

1681
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So I believe that they feel that

1682
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
there is such a coupling.

1683
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
If you are studying

1684
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
the so-called general cell line,

1685
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
you know that the cell line has been isolated

1686
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and raised for several generations.

1687
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Basically, we think that

1688
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it should be adapted.

1689
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It has adapted to this environment.

1690
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So at this time,

1691
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the coupling may not be so strong.

1692
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Because it can split itself.

1693
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Because if it can't go through that,

1694
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
it can't survive.

1695
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So there are some selection processes.

1696
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So

1697
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I think

1698
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
but recently

1699
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
someone started to discuss this issue.

1700
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
For example,

1701
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I know that Sample has a group.

1702
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I just started the lab recently.

1703
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He is discussing that

1704
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
cells will become longer

1705
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
in the process of classification.

1706
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
As I just said,

1707
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Anaphase will actually become longer.

1708
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This process

1709
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
is actually very important.

1710
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Then he did a

1711
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
more harsh approach.

1712
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He just tried to make the cell

1713
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
become super hard.

1714
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So hard that

1715
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
cells can't do

1716
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
the work of prostitution.

1717
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You will find that

1718
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
there is also a strange phenomenon in the mouse.

1719
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I think this is quite abnormal.

1720
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But I think it's quite interesting.

1721
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So actually

1722
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
the direction you just mentioned

1723
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
is exactly

1724
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
what people have been doing

1725
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in the past five years.

1726
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
After technology has matured,

1727
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
people started to study.

1728
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But it's mainly

1729
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
about

1730
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
cells

1731
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and the so-called

1732
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
3D culture.

1733
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I hope I answered your question.

1734
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yes, thank you.

1735
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Sorry.

1736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I want to follow up on a question.

1737
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Because

1738
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
what we just talked about

1739
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
is like

1740
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
white blood cells.

1741
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Especially like cancer.

1742
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If you look at it,

1743
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
will it have

1744
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
a very different mechanism on it?

1745
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Good question.

1746
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yes.

1747
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So according to

1748
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
the article I just mentioned,

1749
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
what you just said is

1750
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I use breast cells, right?

1751
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That work is actually

1752
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
a group from MIT.

1753
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But that PI

1754
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
seems to have died

1755
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
in the past year or two.

1756
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But this is a bit unfortunate.

1757
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That group

1758
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
made a lot of cells.

1759
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It found that

1760
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
what you said is right.

1761
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If it was originally in the blood,

1762
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
it doesn't need

1763
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
cell proliferation.

1764
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then it won't have this phenomenon.

1765
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But if it's breast or liver,

1766
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
it has this phenomenon.

1767
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So it looks like different cells

1768
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
live in different environments.

1769
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Indeed, there will be different responses.

1770
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You have a good intuition.

1771
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Thank you, thank you.

1772
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
OK.

1773
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
My friends didn't ask any questions.

1774
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Strange.

1775
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Do you have any more questions?

1776
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
If not,

1777
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I will turn off the microphone

1778
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and turn off the video later.

1779
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Before turning off the video,

1780
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
please turn on the microphone first.

1781
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Let's give a round of applause

1782
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
to thank Geng Yuan's speech.

1783
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You should be able to hear

1784
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
the sound of the video being turned off.

1785
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Thank you.

1786
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Thank you.

1787
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Thank you.

1788
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Thank you.

1789
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Thank you.

1790
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Thank you.

1791
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Thank you.

1792
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Thank you.

1793
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Thank you.

1794
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Thank you.

1795
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Thank you.

1796
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Thank you.

1797
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Thank you.
