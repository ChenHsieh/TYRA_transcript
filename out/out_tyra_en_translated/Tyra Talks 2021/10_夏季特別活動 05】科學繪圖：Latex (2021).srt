00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. I'm very happy to be here for the fifth session of the Project TARA summer series.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today's event is a scientific drawing sharing by Professor Liu Junlin.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll quickly introduce Professor Liu's background.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Professor Liu is currently studying electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He is currently working as an assistant professor.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In 2010, he obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Later, he obtained a master's degree in telecommunications.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In 2018, he obtained a doctorate in Caltech.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
His research interests include Sparse Error Signal Processing and Statistical Signal Processing.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Today, Professor Liu will share with us his experience in latex.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
On behalf of the audience, I welcome Professor Liu's speech.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now, I'll give Professor Liu the floor. Thank you.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you very much for the introduction.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did you hear my voice?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, thank you.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for the invitation to Project TARA.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's an honor for me to share my experience in latex.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In my presentation, I will introduce my experience in latex and some basic ideas.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you have any questions or ideas during the presentation, please feel free to ask.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, let's move on to today's presentation.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Today is the fifth session of our summer special event.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We will talk about scientific drawing.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We will mainly use the latex tool.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Before we start, I would like to ask the audience,

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Have you ever heard of the term latex?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can you raise your hand or make a sound?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I see some of the audience in the chat have heard of it.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For those who have heard of it, they may think that latex is a tool for writing papers.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why put it under the theme of scientific drawing?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is what I want to share with you today.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Latex actually has some relative tools that can be used for scientific drawing.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I also have some relative experience.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's continue our presentation.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
First of all, I will do a simple introduction.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then I will take some time to introduce latex.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If some of the audience has not heard of it or is not familiar with some of the details,

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will take some time to introduce what latex is to the audience.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The third part is that I will specifically mention a term called PGFTIKZ.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It can be a good combination with latex.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will also mention some related examples.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Finally, I will explain some related resources to you.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you are interested, you can use it as a reference.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today's topic is scientific drawing.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I believe that most of the audience is academic background.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So in the academic background,

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you often need to do an academic expression.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What is academic expression?

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You may need to write a paper.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Or you need to write a verbal report.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Today's occasion is more like a verbal report.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In some occasions, you will need to make a poster report.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
These are some media that are academic in expressing some concepts or more complex ideas.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It may be in the form of an article, a video, or a poster.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In these forms,

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
this chart is actually a very efficient way of communication.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can imagine that

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
when you have a more complex concept that needs to be explained,

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
if you use a lot of very long sentences to explain

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and draw a simple chart,

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
everyone can see it clearly.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Usually, most readers prefer to use charts

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to make a conceptual expression.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So if you want to add some charts to your post,

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the next question is

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
which interface to use to generate this chart?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I believe I mentioned two weeks ago that

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you can use Illustrator to draw some pretty charts.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The theme of this week is

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to use the Latex language interface.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It actually has some corresponding kits and tools

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to create some nice charts.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me quickly use a sentence to explain what Latex is.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's actually a layout system.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What this layout system does is

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
a lot of text files

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
after a series of compilation processes

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
are laid out into the file files you see.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So in fact, like the video I reported today,

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I also did it with Latex.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In fact, there are a lot of

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
text compilations behind it.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
These text compilations will tell us

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
what words are in this page,

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
what color are these words,

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
what are the order of these items,

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and so on.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It will compile such a file.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Latex is a layout software.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It can compile a file based on such compilations

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to look like the one you see in the video.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's quickly talk about PGF and TIKZ.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
PGF is actually called

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Portable Graphics Format.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In fact, what everyone is familiar with

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is the language of TIKZ.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's actually a Latex kit.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This kit is for drawing some charts,

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
especially when you use a compilation method

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to describe a chart.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There are some particularly useful methods.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In the remaining time,

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will also mention one called PGF Plots.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It is also a Latex kit.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It can draw some common charts.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After using it myself,

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I feel like I want to share it with you.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So today I will focus on

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
introducing these tools

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and some of my personal experience.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is a general idea

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that we will go through today.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Next, I will show you a chart.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let me tell you about this chart first.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This chart is a chart I took

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
from my class video.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to use this chart to give you an example.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
First of all, when you look at this chart,

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you see a lot of words,

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
a lot of shapes, a lot of colors.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Here is an example of this chart.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In fact, to describe this chart,

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it can be divided into several steps.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
One step is the words marked above.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
For example, you see a lot of words up here.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then there are some relative numerals.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There are also some relative words and numerals below.

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So if you want to express a concept clearly,

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
there may be some relative numbers of words above.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In this chart,

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you can also see some relative shapes.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
For example, you can see a lot of squares here.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then there are a lot of regular squares lined up.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Of course, the focus of today's speech

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
is not to introduce these details.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I mainly use this chart to give you an example.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
To produce this chart,

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
you need to have some descriptions of the shapes.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then you may need to do something like

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
drawing a line to produce this chart.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So you can see that there are

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
all kinds of lines between different squares.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There are green lines, there are orange lines,

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and there may be some relatively small words marked above.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So usually on this kind of expression,

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
there may be some colors

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
or some relative text styles.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
These may be some points that you can focus on

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
when designing the chart.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You may see this chart and think

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that it seems to contain a lot of details.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let me explain to you first.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is actually one of the pages of the last video.

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The complete version actually has a relative animation.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That is to say, different colors,

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
different labels will gradually appear.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But here is just to give you a demonstration and reference.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you have any questions during the listening process,

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you are very welcome to make a question.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then we can have a discussion at the moment.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you don't have any questions,

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
let me introduce the tools now.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
My takeaway today is that

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I hope you will have some ideas

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
about how to produce this kind of chart

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
after listening to it.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Of course, how to produce it in detail

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
will be related to the instructions for this chart.

168
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But I hope to inspire you to say

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that if you want to produce this kind of chart,

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
how to do it with Latex?

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
First, let me introduce this Latex.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Latex, as I just mentioned,

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
is a layout software.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
In fact, it is not a single software.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It has a relatively advanced layout system.

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I listed a few here.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For example, if you have more research

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
on the details of this kind of Latex,

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
it is actually divided into a Plantex.

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It is the most primitive version.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Later, someone based on this Plantex

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to make some improvements,

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
such as improving Latex or PDF Latex

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
or some extension versions

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
that can be compiled into Chinese.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But these are all relative technical details.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It actually has a relative development history.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think today's topic is more scientific.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So I probably won't do

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
a detailed analysis of these items.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What you hear is to get a concept first.

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's basically a...

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you have some writing experience,

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you can think of it as

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
something like a compiler.

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It stores some text information

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and then does some interpretation and analysis

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
according to these text contents,

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and then produces a relative file.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When you look at the paper,

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in fact, a more common file format

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
should be a PDF format.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So this Latex,

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
it's a relatively common design,

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that is, the step of producing a file is

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that the user actually compiles a text file.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The alias of this text file is .tex.

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then after some proper compilation,

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it can produce a PDF file.

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This PDF is a bit like the PDF files

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you see when you read the paper.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So this is a basic process of Latex.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In fact, if you are not familiar with

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
this process,

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if you have used Word

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
to write documents,

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
this Word file basically means

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
that you have a full window screen.

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In this window screen,

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
suppose you have a full window screen,

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
you can do something under this screen,

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
such as inputting text and inserting a picture,

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
or doing some editing.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This kind of compiler is more like

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
you can see the file at the moment of editing.

226
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What does it look like?

227
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This Latex is another kind.

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a little bit more indirect.

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
When you are operating,

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
it's actually editing a text file.

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The text file is just describing

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
what the final document should look like

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in a narrative language.

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So when you are editing a text file,

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you have to use a little bit of your imagination,

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that is, you give this command,

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and then it might look like

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This PDF is the last file you see.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So this editing aspect

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
may not be the same as

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the Word you often use.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's continue.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Next, I'm going to make an example.

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you haven't touched Latex,

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll give you a simple example.

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is this word too small?

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The left side is TEX file.

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
After proper compilation,

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
a PDF file will be created.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you think the picture is too small,

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you can tell me,

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and I can make some adjustments here.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Basically, a common TEX file

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
has a standard way to do it.

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This standard way is like this.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That is, when you are narrating this file,

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you have to explain

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
what kind of thing you produce.

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Is it an article?

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Or, for example,

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
there are some commands that can be generated,

262
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
such as a video.

263
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It will need to define

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
what kind of thing I produce.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It has a command here called

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
draw a diagonal line, then document class,

267
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
followed by the type of file you want to produce.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's very similar to writing,

269
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that is,

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in the process of editing,

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you need to insert some packages appropriately.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
These packages can tell you

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
what commands you can use next.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What commands are defined next?

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let me mention this a little bit.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The first package is a generation.

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It will be used in the 16th line.

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It is a command to generate a test text.

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The command in the 5th line

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is a relatively

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
if you want to input some mathematical equations,

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
some commands will be defined

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
in this AMS Math environment.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So, after the 18th line,

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
there are some mathematical equations.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So, in order to use these commands,

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
we need to introduce some relative packages.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Another one is that there is some information,

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
like this one.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I just mentioned that it is an article.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So, typical articles may need

292
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
a title information,

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
then the author's information,

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and the date and time information.

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It may need to be explained

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
with some relevant commands.

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
After setting up these environments,

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the 10th line below

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
describes the content of your file.

300
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So, like the 13th line,

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it is a title of a file.

302
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So, after entering this command,

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
the three parts on the right PDF will be generated,

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that is, the title, the author's name and time.

305
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The part of the 16th line

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
will generate some test text.

307
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So, this is the part of the 16th line test text

308
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in this place.

309
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After the 19th line,

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
some mathematical formulas are generated.

311
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
These mathematical formulas are

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
under this text.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So, in practice,

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the advantage is that

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
you can focus on

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
what you want to write.

317
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
For example, you focus on

318
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the content you want to write,

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and then the relative arrangement,

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
or the font,

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
or these words,

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the mathematical formula,

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
the relative position.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This arrangement system

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
has a set of methods

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to arrange these relative positions.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So, when you write this text,

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you just need to focus on

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the content of the text.

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So, this is an example

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to show you this LaTeX.

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let me explain to you

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
some of the corresponding tools of LaTeX.

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I believe that

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
LaTeX has a lot of choices.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I mainly divide it into three categories.

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
One is called the editor.

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It is mainly used to edit this text file.

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The other is the layout system.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Then, the PDF file you produce

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
will also need some software

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
to look at the content of this PDF file.

343
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So, if you want to set up

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
these environments on your computer,

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you may need some relative...

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For example, set up an editor,

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
a layout system,

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and then choose a PDF viewer.

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
There are actually quite a few editors on the market.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There are some editors

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
specifically designed for LaTeX,

352
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
such as these below,

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
or some more common editors

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that can only edit pure text,

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
such as these.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because of time constraints,

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I won't mention all of them.

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
After you have edited these text files,

359
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I just mentioned that

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you still need some editing systems.

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
These three are more common on the market.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
These three can actually be downloaded for free

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and installed on your computer.

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They have some relative

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
system environment settings.

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because of time constraints,

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I won't mention these environment settings.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
After you have successfully edited,

369
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
there will be some relative

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
PDF file viewers.

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Let me show you an example.

372
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If I choose from here,

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
let's say I choose Visual Studio Code.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If you are writing code,

375
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you may have heard of this editor.

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Then use TextLive.

377
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This computer has already installed TextLive.

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Then there may be a PDF viewer at the end.

379
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So I'll open a demo here.

380
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Just this file.

381
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This file is the same.

382
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This is actually the same as a writer.

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There will be some relative editing functions behind it.

384
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then this one just happens to be able to

385
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
go straight to this relative PDF function.

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So if you want to edit,

387
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
let's say you want to add more things here.

388
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Just add it directly.

389
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If you edit,

390
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it will be right here.

391
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
After editing,

392
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the PDF file will be updated.

393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If you haven't used LaTeX,

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
it's actually a...

395
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I feel like it's pretty close to writing.

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's just that the final result is a PDF file.

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The above is mainly a basic introduction to LaTeX.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You may be curious.

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So there are so many file editing tools.

400
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So why do we have to use LaTeX?

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then I'm here to quickly mention

402
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
some of the features or advantages of LaTeX.

403
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
One of the features is that

404
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
it deals with this kind of mathematical problem.

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Assuming that your report or paper

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
requires a lot of mathematical problems.

407
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In fact, it has some advantages in using LaTeX.

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
For example,

409
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
like you want to enter the lower right corner of this

410
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
these mathematical formulas.

411
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What about these mathematical formulas?

412
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You can see that it's actually...

413
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll give you an example here.

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It may be related to some symbols of some triangular functions.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If you want to enter this content,

416
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
under LaTeX,

417
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
it actually opens a relative mathematical environment.

418
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Then like these functions,

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
these sine, zeta,

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
or something like the denominator.

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It will have some corresponding mathematical symbols.

422
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
For example, there are some sine, zeta,

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
or if you want to enter the denominator.

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The denominator has some relative environments that can be entered.

425
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Here's a strange symbol.

426
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It actually has some relative symbols

427
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that can be entered.

428
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
If your file has a lot of mathematical problems,

429
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
for example, there are very long mathematical inferences,

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
formula proofs, and so on.

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Editing in text format

432
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
is actually easier to maintain.

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Because when you look at the text,

434
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
you can just look at this symbol

435
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and know what this symbol is.

436
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And save these symbols

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and translate them into our beautiful mathematical form.

438
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Another thing I would like to mention by the way is

439
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that LaTeX also has a feature

440
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that is when you have a lot of things

441
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that need to be interacted with and used.

442
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
For example,

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
in some related papers that may need a lot of mathematical terms,

444
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
sometimes it may use numbers to represent some equations.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Put it in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4.

446
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Under the progress of the article,

447
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
we may need to say

448
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
which mathematical formula we use to push something.

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So in the article,

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
we need to repeatedly mention some mathematical numbers.

451
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
LaTeX actually has some pretty good features.

452
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You can use the interaction query command.

453
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You can set up a label.

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In the article,

455
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
when you want to quote this label,

456
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
you can use it as a variable.

457
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Okay, let me tell you quickly

458
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that this is a feature of LaTeX.

459
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It has a very powerful function

460
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in dealing with mathematical numbers.

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay, another one is my personal experience.

462
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It is a feature of LaTeX.

463
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Its feature is that

464
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
when you are dealing with a very long file,

465
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
it has a special advantage.

466
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What is a very long file?

467
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
For example,

468
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
if you want to write a master's thesis or a doctor's thesis,

469
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
at this time,

470
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the number of pages may reach a lot of pages.

471
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or for example,

472
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
if you want to...

473
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
For example,

474
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
some textbooks you see on the market.

475
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Textbooks may have hundreds or thousands of pages.

476
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
At this time,

477
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you can try to think about

478
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
how to maintain these hundreds or thousands of pages.

479
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
In fact, LaTeX has a feature that I personally quite like.

480
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That is,

481
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it can split the content of the file

482
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
into different files to write.

483
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So here's an example.

484
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Suppose you have a file named man.tex now.

485
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This can be seen as a main file.

486
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This main file will describe that

487
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
there are two parts in this article.

488
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
One is introduction,

489
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and the other is results.

490
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
That's the end of the description.

491
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
By the way,

492
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
this input file is...

493
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The input command can be seen as

494
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the content of this file is arranged.

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You can do an understanding like this first.

496
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So when LaTeX meets here,

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
it will grab the corresponding file.

498
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So at this time,

499
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
when you write the introduction,

500
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you just have to focus on the narrative of the introduction.

501
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So this file is

502
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
specifically talking about the content of the introduction.

503
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You can see that it has some test text.

504
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Then there is a line of test text here.

505
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This introduction,

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I actually have a command here,

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
which is section.

508
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It is actually one of the sections of this article.

509
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Then the section is followed by the title of this section.

510
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So if you want to focus on writing the introduction,

511
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
just open this file and focus on writing it.

512
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
If you want to write another section,

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
such as results,

514
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
just focus on opening this file

515
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and focus on editing here.

516
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So writing these files separately

517
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
is actually easier for you to maintain longer files.

518
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There is another one that I personally think

519
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
LaTeX is a powerful function.

520
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That is, if you are good at using the input command,

521
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
you can think of it as

522
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the input is to grab a file from the outside

523
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and paste it over.

524
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So in fact, if you have some experimental data,

525
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
let's assume that these data are stored in text.

526
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Suppose you use the program to calculate a number.

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Suppose the number is 1, 2, 3.

528
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Then you can store this number in a text file.

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
When you are editing the file,

530
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you can insert the number content of this text file

531
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
in the right place.

532
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You may ask,

533
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
why don't I just type 1, 2, 3 here?

534
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The resulting file result is the same.

535
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But from the perspective of maintenance,

536
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I personally prefer to separate the file content

537
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
from the experimental data

538
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
to make a separate file.

539
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Suppose you run different experiments later

540
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and the data needs to be updated.

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You just need to update this file.

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You don't need to jump back to the result section

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
to change this number.

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Especially if this number is used a lot.

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This has appeared in many articles.

546
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If you change one of the two,

547
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and you forget to change one,

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you may be challenged by the reviewer at this time.

549
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So what do you show?

550
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If you want to maintain a larger file

551
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
from a longer perspective,

552
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
these files may need to be changed and updated.

553
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I personally think this kind of separate file is quite recommended.

554
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mentioned two features of LaTeX here.

555
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Then I will talk about a Graphics

556
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
which is included in today's topic.

557
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Use LaTeX to add some elements of scientific drawing.

558
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If you search for LaTeX on the Internet,

559
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
most of the files will tell you

560
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that there is an instruction called Include Graphics.

561
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This instruction tells us that

562
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
this instruction needs a package called GraphicsX

563
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
to be used.

564
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Simply put,

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
it will extract the file from your computer.

566
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
For example, there is a JPEG file at this time.

567
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
This JPEG file will be extracted

568
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and placed in the proper place in your PDF file.

569
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So I have an example here.

570
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So he grabbed two pictures.

571
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
One is JPEG and the other is PNG.

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
He grabbed these two pictures to make a layout.

573
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
In fact, the left one is JPEG,

574
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and the right one is PNG.

575
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So now you have two pictures.

576
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because of time constraints,

577
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I may not be able to explain each instruction.

578
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If you have any questions later,

579
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
you are welcome to ask.

580
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So this is basically an instruction

581
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to insert two pictures.

582
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
When you draw a picture,

583
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you need to pay attention to

584
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that the picture is divided into Raster Scan.

585
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You take a picture.

586
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Suppose you have a picture on your hand.

587
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Raster Graphics is a bit like

588
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
it takes a lot of different pixels in this picture

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and records the color of each pixel.

590
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So, for example, JPEG or PNG,

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
it basically stores the data behind

592
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
what the information of each pixel is.

593
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Of course, it does some image processing

594
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and some other processing.

595
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But its basic spirit is

596
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to store the contents of different colors.

597
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But this kind of storage method

598
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
will have a disadvantage.

599
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That is,

600
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
suppose you put this picture very large.

601
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I may not be able to see it clearly here.

602
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If you have JPEG or PNG on your hand,

603
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
you can try to put these pictures.

604
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
If you can't,

605
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you can, for example,

606
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
zoom in on a place.

607
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Keep zooming in, zooming in, zooming in.

608
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
At the end of the zoom,

609
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you will see some blurry images on the edge.

610
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The text may also become more blurry

611
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and may not be able to be read.

612
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
In terms of academic documents,

613
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
this is actually a bad thing.

614
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Because it may affect

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
our understanding of a concept

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
or judgment.

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In fact, in academic documents,

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it is more preferable to use

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
so-called vector graphics.

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That is, when you are storing a picture,

621
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you should actually use the so-called pixel picture.

622
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
When you describe these documents,

623
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you should use,

624
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
now there is a picture.

625
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What is its length and width?

626
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Where is its location?

627
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The coordinates of these points in it.

628
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Or these lines,

629
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
are they round, square,

630
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
straight, or triangle?

631
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Use these methods to describe a picture.

632
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Academic documents are actually

633
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
more preferable to do this.

634
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The commonly used vector graphics

635
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
is actually called an EPS file.

636
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It is a commonly used vector graphics

637
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
file format.

638
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So here you might think,

639
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so if I use LaTeX,

640
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I will just,

641
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
like the files generated by your program,

642
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I will just save it as an EPS file

643
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and insert it into it.

644
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Theoretically, you can do this.

645
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But have you ever thought about

646
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
some situations?

647
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I will give you an example here.

648
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
These situations are actually

649
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
encountered in writing paper.

650
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Suppose there are two pictures now,

651
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
the picture on the left and the picture on the right.

652
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I will give you an example.

653
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Suppose you want to present

654
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
a picture like this.

655
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Then there may be a curve here,

656
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and another curve here.

657
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then there may be some

658
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
corresponding legend,

659
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
that is,

660
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
what is number one and what is number two?

661
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Number one may be one of the lines,

662
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and number two may be one of the lines.

663
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Have you ever encountered a situation

664
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
that when you print these pictures,

665
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
some parts of the picture,

666
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
such as some corresponding labels here,

667
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
it happens to be related to

668
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
some square numbers in your paper.

669
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Suppose one of the curves

670
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
is generated by your source code number 1,

671
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and the other one may be generated

672
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
by the source code number 3.

673
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Suppose you need to encounter

674
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
a picture like this.

675
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What about a picture like this?

676
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If you first save it

677
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
to the EPS file in the city,

678
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
this number 1 and number 3

679
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
are actually already written in this file.

680
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
At that time, if you are editing the paper,

681
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
when this number 1 and number 3 change,

682
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
your picture will not do the corresponding update.

683
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So this is actually a situation

684
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
that I had encountered when I was writing paper.

685
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Then I tried to figure out

686
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
if there was a more systematic way

687
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
to deal with this problem.

688
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
This is what I'm going to talk about later,

689
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a method of pgftikz.

690
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's my personal experience.

691
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Do you have any questions here?

692
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
If you have any questions,

693
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you can ask me by voice.

694
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
If not,

695
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
let me talk about the tool pgftikz.

696
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
First of all, when we talk about this tool,

697
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
let's go back to the picture thing.

698
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
In the field that is more related to me,

699
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
the pictures that are usually involved

700
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
are probably these two types.

701
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
One is called a system architecture picture.

702
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It will describe

703
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
how your information is processed.

704
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
For example, you have done some add-ons,

705
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
do some processing of different systems,

706
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and then put some relative information

707
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
to make some different connections.

708
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The following picture is in my field of research,

709
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
which is a relatively common picture.

710
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This is called a system architecture picture.

711
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
When you look at this picture,

712
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
it's actually quite simple.

713
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It is mainly composed of several elements,

714
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
which are text, some lines,

715
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and some different squares,

716
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
such as a rectangle or a circle.

717
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's probably just these elements.

718
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's not very complicated to describe.

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So how to effectively produce this kind of relative picture

720
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
is actually a very interesting topic.

721
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This is a system diagram.

722
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The other one is the one I just mentioned,

723
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
which is a diagram.

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
For example, the one on my right is also a diagram.

725
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Let's say it has two curves.

726
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
These two curves may have their own

727
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
horizontal and vertical axes,

728
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and then there will be relative information points.

729
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm just drawing a diagram here.

730
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
These information points may be represented

731
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
by a circle and a rectangle.

732
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
These two pictures

733
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
can actually be used with Lattice,

734
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
which is Lattice coupled with TIKZ or PGF plots,

735
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
which is a relative command,

736
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to produce two such pictures directly in Lattice.

737
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So next I'm going to explain to you

738
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
that if you want to produce these pictures,

739
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you may need some relevant content.

740
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay, let me show you the program.

741
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
TIKZ is mainly like this.

742
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You can imagine it as a language

743
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
that describes the shape of the picture.

744
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This language, as I just mentioned,

745
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is a picture of a quantity.

746
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So if you recall some of the concepts

747
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
of quantity that you may have learned before,

748
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
to describe a quantity,

749
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
it may be to describe its starting point and ending point,

750
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and then connect them together.

751
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Then I know how to describe different shapes.

752
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This is to describe this triangle,

753
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
which is to mark the end point.

754
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Or if it's a circle,

755
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it may be to describe its circumference and radius.

756
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So it's actually a combination of

757
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
describing the shape you produce.

758
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So here's an example.

759
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For example, if you want to draw a line,

760
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
its relative command is actually quite direct.

761
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You just need to determine the relative coordinates.

762
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The relative command is that you draw a straight line

763
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and then draw it from the coordinate point 00

764
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
to the coordinate point 10.

765
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So when you run the fourth line,

766
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it will produce this line.

767
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
From 00 to 10,

768
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
it draws this line.

769
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
There are also some commands that say

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
you can decorate this line.

771
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
For example, you can draw a arrow.

772
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Its relative command is that

773
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
you draw a shape like an arrow.

774
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Draw a line and then a triangle.

775
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The shape of this arrow starts from 00.

776
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You can think of it as drawing an arrow

777
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
from 00 to 01.

778
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So it's the arrow above.

779
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So it's actually a pretty intuitive description language

780
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
to describe some geometric shapes.

781
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
For example, if you want to draw a triangle,

782
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
it's actually the relative coordinate point.

783
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's actually this point.

784
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
This point is our 11 coordinate point.

785
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Then this point is 22.

786
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Then this is 2.

787
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So you draw these lines

788
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and connect them.

789
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There are some additional commands.

790
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
For example, you can adjust the thickness of the line,

791
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
adjust the format of the line,

792
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
or adjust the color of the line.

793
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
This is a demo for you.

794
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Of course, it can draw something like a circle.

795
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
This means that the center of the circle is 1-1.

796
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The center of the circle is 1-1,

797
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
and the radius is 0.5.

798
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So it draws this.

799
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You can also draw something relative.

800
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
For example, it draws a rectangle.

801
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This rectangle,

802
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
its command is

803
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
to draw from one corner of this rectangle

804
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to another corner.

805
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So the upper left corner is 3-1,

806
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and the lower right corner is 4-2.

807
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So it's actually

808
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
as long as you determine the coordinate system,

809
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and then determine some coordinate numbers,

810
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
it actually has some pretty intuitive language

811
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to draw these pictures.

812
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So this is basically the function of TIKZ drawing.

813
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You can actually go back to

814
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
suppose you need to draw a picture.

815
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
If it's something like

816
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
some of the architecture pictures mentioned earlier,

817
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it's actually nothing more than some lines, shapes,

818
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and some combinations of text blocks.

819
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So if you want to draw a text block,

820
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it can use a command called node.

821
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This node command,

822
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
you can think of it as

823
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
insert a text block,

824
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and then insert it in which position.

825
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
For example, the command 22 is

826
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
inserted in 00.

827
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Insert a text block in 00.

828
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Then its text content is 00.

829
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
One thing that's special is that

830
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
in this place,

831
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
it's actually

832
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
the place where I marked in green,

833
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
it's actually in harmony with the lattice.

834
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Simply put,

835
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
the grammar you can use in the lattice,

836
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
including the mathematical formula you use,

837
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
or the formula you want to quote,

838
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
or the reference number you want to quote,

839
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
can all be written directly here.

840
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then when the lattice is compiled,

841
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
it will automatically update this part.

842
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Because of the time factor,

843
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I may not go into detail about these commands.

844
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Basically, you can create some text blocks.

845
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Then I will tell you another concept.

846
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
What I personally like about TIK is that

847
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
it can make a very precise description of your chart.

848
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
What's the reason?

849
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The reason is that it uses some

850
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
coordinate numbers behind it

851
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
to describe the shape of the chart.

852
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So for example,

853
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
let's say I draw this picture on the right.

854
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
This picture on the right,

855
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I have listed the corresponding commands.

856
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Basically, it is inserted into a text block.

857
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What I want to do is to insert a text block.

858
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Then its content is this text box.

859
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Then some corresponding styles.

860
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Then its location is 0, 0 in the coordinate system.

861
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Then a more special thing is that

862
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
you can take a name for this text block.

863
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Take a name like this with a small quotation mark.

864
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Then when you draw something else,

865
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you can compare this name,

866
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
the name of the text box,

867
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
to describe its different locations.

868
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
For example, it's like 6 to 8 here.

869
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It can target the north-west of the text box,

870
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
this top left point.

871
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Draw a circle at this point on the left of the text box.

872
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Then the radius of this circle is 0.05.

873
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So you get this circle.

874
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It is very accurately pasted on the top left corner of this text box.

875
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You can draw it like the north side

876
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
or other places like this.

877
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So you can draw these corresponding locations.

878
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
These locations can also be called anchor points.

879
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That is, when you connect the lines,

880
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
you can directly force the specified line to connect to this point,

881
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
or this point, this point.

882
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So this is the one for TIKZ.

883
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Then I will explain a little bit about

884
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
some of my personal experience

885
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and some of the experience of drawing this system architecture.

886
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
One of my personal favorites is that

887
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
it is actually quite compatible with Lattice.

888
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
For example, you are in this place of this text,

889
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
it is actually the direct input of the corresponding Lattice command.

890
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So when you have a square number,

891
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
or some numbers,

892
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
or some special mathematical characters,

893
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
for example,

894
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
like you need a special character in this picture,

895
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it can be presented perfectly.

896
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Another one is the relative size.

897
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
These sizes are actually all described in numbers,

898
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
so it can describe the relative position very accurately.

899
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So these two text boxes are actually the same size.

900
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That is, the size of this square and this square is the same.

901
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And they are actually completely aligned.

902
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
If you put the picture carefully,

903
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
you can see that the left half and the right half are curved,

904
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and they are precisely aligned.

905
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Why is that?

906
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In fact, when you are writing,

907
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
you have already described this thing accurately.

908
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So the picture he made

909
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
can be very precise in size and position.

910
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Another one is that

911
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I think this kind of picture is easier to maintain.

912
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Simply put,

913
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
because there are these text boxes behind it,

914
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
so if you want to maintain it,

915
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
if you want to make all the circles bigger in this text box,

916
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't want to use 0.05,

917
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I want to make all these circles bigger.

918
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
In fact, it is to make some search replacements in the text box,

919
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
and replace all these 0.05.

920
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Another one is my personal opinion.

921
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Because it is a text box,

922
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
so if you have some software

923
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
that allows you to control the interface,

924
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and if you have experience in using it,

925
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
it can be used in a way like git

926
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
to maintain your file or image,

927
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
how to make changes.

928
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So this is what I think about drawing some pictures with TIKZ.

929
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Next, let's talk about some plots.

930
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
This plot,

931
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
you can look at it as

932
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
some of the pictures we just drew in some experiments.

933
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Some of the pictures presented in some experiments,

934
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and then there may be some horizontal and vertical descriptions.

935
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
To produce this picture,

936
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
you can think about

937
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
what you actually did

938
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
when you produced this picture.

939
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
In fact, it doesn't matter,

940
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you probably did three things.

941
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The first thing is that

942
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
you worked very hard to do some experiments,

943
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
write some cities,

944
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
produce some experimental data,

945
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
or collect some experimental data.

946
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So this should be a stage for you to do research,

947
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which is to produce some experimental data.

948
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The other stage is that

949
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
according to your experimental data,

950
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you want to produce some more beautiful pictures,

951
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and then maybe clearer,

952
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
some pictures that are more visible,

953
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
so this may be the second stage.

954
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
The third stage is that

955
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
when you produce the picture,

956
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
you need to present it in,

957
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
for example, your paper,

958
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
or your video,

959
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
or on your poster.

960
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So there may be these three stages.

961
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The stage that people use more often

962
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
may be that

963
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
they tend to use the same software

964
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
for stage 1 and stage 2.

965
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
For example,

966
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
what I use more often is MATLAB.

967
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You can do some calculations in MATLAB,

968
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and then it has some functions that can produce pictures.

969
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
After the picture, you can save it like this,

970
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and then save it,

971
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and then paste it on,

972
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
for example, your paper or slides.

973
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This is a method.

974
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
If you have some other languages,

975
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
such as Python or R,

976
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
or GNU Plot,

977
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it actually has a lot of different choices.

978
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
This is a method.

979
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's a more common method.

980
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Here, I'd like to ask you a few situations.

981
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
These situations are actually

982
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
what you encounter when you do research.

983
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
If you encounter the following three situations,

984
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the above methods may become a little bit

985
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
more cumbersome.

986
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The first situation is that

987
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
if you have produced your picture,

988
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and you have shown it to other people,

989
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
to your partner or advisor,

990
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
he thinks this picture

991
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
may need to add one more curve,

992
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
or compare it in one more way,

993
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
or add some more data points.

994
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
If you use a method like MATLAB,

995
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
you may have to go back to the original city,

996
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and run the city again.

997
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But think about it,

998
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
this seems to be a little bit,

999
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
some places are repeated.

1000
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
In fact, in this picture,

1001
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
there are some curves and some data

1002
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
that you have dealt with before.

1003
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So you don't need to deal with it again.

1004
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
What you need to do

1005
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
is to deal with

1006
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
what you haven't done yet.

1007
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So, is there anything

1008
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that can separate this thing?

1009
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's like the first thing,

1010
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
produce data and draw a picture.

1011
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Can these two things be handled separately?

1012
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
When you have a new experiment,

1013
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
you should focus on

1014
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
producing new data.

1015
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Drawing a picture,

1016
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
you should have a common interface

1017
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
to update the picture.

1018
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Another situation is that

1019
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
maybe when you are writing a paper,

1020
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
suppose you change the mathematical symbol.

1021
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In the process of changing the paper,

1022
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
maybe there are some mathematical symbols

1023
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Then you may change it to B.

1024
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It becomes that in this article,

1025
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
everything with the symbol A

1026
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
has to be changed to the symbol B.

1027
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
If unfortunately,

1028
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
this symbol B appears in one of the small places

1029
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
in your picture,

1030
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
then you have to go back and open the method

1031
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and manually change the place of A to B.

1032
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
When there are a lot of things,

1033
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
this thing is actually a little bit,

1034
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
it's a little bit cumbersome.

1035
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Then there is another one,

1036
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
which is the relative mathematical symbol.

1037
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
If you have some drawing experience,

1038
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
the picture produced by MATLAB,

1039
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
the text below it is actually a certain symbol.

1040
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But if you use LaTeX to write a paper,

1041
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
the shape of the symbol required by the paper

1042
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
is actually sometimes another one.

1043
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It may not be the same as the MATLAB symbol.

1044
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So is there a way to say

1045
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that all the symbols are unified?

1046
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
In addition,

1047
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
if there is a mathematical shape here,

1048
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
suppose some more special mathematical symbols,

1049
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
can they appear in this picture

1050
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
with the same shape?

1051
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
In fact, I encountered some relative situations

1052
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
in the drawing before.

1053
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
After a little research,

1054
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I think I personally

1055
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
use this method of PGF plot.

1056
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It is actually a drawing tool,

1057
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and it is based on TIKZ as a drawing function.

1058
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It is compatible with LaTeX.

1059
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It is a new drawing tool,

1060
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but its spirit of drawing

1061
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
is actually similar to most drawing software.

1062
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You will need to produce relative labels,

1063
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
legend, or some different line format.

1064
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
This part of the spirit is close.

1065
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because of time constraints,

1066
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I may quickly mention that

1067
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
although this is a new tool,

1068
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
but there are some ready-made conversion tools.

1069
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Suppose the picture produced by MATLAB

1070
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
can have some converters

1071
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
that can be converted to TIKZ language.

1072
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This is what I found when I was making the video,

1073
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that is, some pictures produced by Python

1074
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
also have some related packages

1075
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
that can be converted to the language of TIKZ.

1076
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Another experience I would like to mention is

1077
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that suppose you need to update your data.

1078
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
As mentioned earlier,

1079
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
suppose you have three experimental pictures,

1080
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and you may be asked to add another curve.

1081
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
At this time,

1082
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
you don't need to create a new picture.

1083
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
My own approach is

1084
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
that you should maintain a text file.

1085
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
This text file describes the data

1086
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
of the relative data points in the green one.

1087
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There may be a blue text file

1088
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
that describes the numbers on the blue lines,

1089
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
the numbers on these pictures.

1090
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
At that time,

1091
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
the pgfplot can directly use the input file method

1092
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
to update these pictures at the same time.

1093
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I want to use the time later

1094
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
to quickly tell you what its philosophy is.

1095
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If you are interested in these instructions,

1096
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
we can discuss it later.

1097
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
This is a pgfplot spirit.

1098
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You can notice that it is actually

1099
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
compatible with the latest.

1100
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It is actually wrapped in the environment of TIKZ.

1101
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
What it does is

1102
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
there is an environment called begin and end access.

1103
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
In this environment,

1104
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
you will need to have a range to explain

1105
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
some of the coordinates,

1106
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
such as its width, its x-level,

1107
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
what is the value, and then what is the y-level value.

1108
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Notice that this place

1109
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
you can put the latest definition.

1110
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So you can make sure that its font is the same.

1111
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So if you look closely at this picture,

1112
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the font of this place

1113
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
is the same as the font of my first video.

1114
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So if you update it like this,

1115
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
it will automatically process these two

1116
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
with the same font.

1117
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The addplot is a bit like

1118
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
you have a curve, so it will produce

1119
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
a curve of data1 here

1120
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and a curve of data2.

1121
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Here it is another

1122
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
from an external text file.

1123
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
This is an external text file.

1124
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It will define all the numbers

1125
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
of these data points.

1126
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Grab these data

1127
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and paste it into this picture.

1128
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I want to tell you quickly.

1129
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Finally, let me tell you

1130
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
what I think of Latex.

1131
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
If you are new to Latex,

1132
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
DIKZ, PJ Plot,

1133
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
maybe you have never touched it

1134
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
or maybe you don't have much experience,

1135
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I personally recommend Overleaf.

1136
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Overleaf is a platform

1137
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
where you can write Latex online.

1138
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Basically,

1139
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
some of the layout settings

1140
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
have been set for you.

1141
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So it will be easier to write.

1142
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I will list some

1143
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
relative reference resources later.

1144
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
If you use Overleaf,

1145
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
it actually has some

1146
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
related instructions

1147
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and some documents

1148
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
that you can learn Latex

1149
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
in 30 minutes.

1150
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I also found some

1151
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
if you want to do

1152
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
a more detailed reference,

1153
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
there are some like Wikibook

1154
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
for reference.

1155
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
If you are interested

1156
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
in this kind of drawing,

1157
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
there is a PGF manual.

1158
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You can click on it.

1159
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It has a pretty detailed

1160
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
document

1161
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
like this.

1162
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Let me show you.

1163
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It has a document

1164
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
for DIKZ, PJ Plot

1165
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
with more than 1,000 pages.

1166
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
In fact, many of my instructions

1167
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
are found from it.

1168
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
The concept is also

1169
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
taken from it.

1170
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Some websites,

1171
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
like this website,

1172
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I think it's pretty good.

1173
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It has some examples of

1174
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
drawing with PJ Plot.

1175
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So if you go in and have a look,

1176
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
there are some pretty

1177
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
maps.

1178
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It also lists the relevant instructions.

1179
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You can have a look.

1180
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Another one is that

1181
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
there are also some online discussions on the Internet.

1182
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
If you have any questions about this kind of text,

1183
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
you can post it on it.

1184
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
What's next?

1185
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I mainly list some

1186
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
editors I mentioned earlier.

1187
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
There are some relative websites

1188
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
with relative editors.

1189
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Basically,

1190
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
these editors should all be

1191
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
downloaded from the website

1192
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and installed.

1193
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It's also like

1194
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
if you want to set up

1195
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
this editor environment

1196
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
on your own computer,

1197
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
there are actually several more common ones.

1198
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I also list the relevant information.

1199
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
If you are interested in

1200
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
this kind of map conversion, DIKZ,

1201
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I also list the relevant

1202
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
websites here.

1203
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You can use it as a reference.

1204
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Okay, I think it's about time.

1205
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Finally, thank you for listening.

1206
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I hope you can

1207
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
use LaTeX

1208
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
in your research

1209
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and successfully express

1210
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
the results you want to express.

1211
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, I think

1212
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
we'll stop here.

1213
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Thank you, Mr. Liu, for your wonderful sharing.

1214
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I just saw

1215
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
in the chat

1216
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
a few questions.

1217
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
If you have any questions,

1218
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
you're welcome to

1219
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
open the microphone

1220
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and ask your question.

1221
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Or if your microphone is not convenient,

1222
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I can quickly go through

1223
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the comments.

1224
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
There are a few comments

1225
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I saw,

1226
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
for example, Yan

1227
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
wants to know

1228
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
how similar

1229
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
LaTeX and HTML are.

1230
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Do you recommend using

1231
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
text editor software?

1232
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Okay, thank you very much

1233
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
for Yan's question.

1234
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I'll start with

1235
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
the degree of similarity between

1236
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
the two languages.

1237
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Here is a

1238
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
user interface

1239
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
for your reference.

1240
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
In fact, if you

1241
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
have a little research

1242
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
on HTML,

1243
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
HTML seems to

1244
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
have something

1245
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
at the beginning of a label

1246
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and something

1247
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
at the end.

1248
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
In LaTeX,

1249
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
it's more like

1250
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
using a line

1251
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and then a command,

1252
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and then put this thing

1253
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
inside with this big quotation mark.

1254
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I feel

1255
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that its spirit is close.

1256
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
For example,

1257
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
if the thing you put in the back

1258
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
is more complicated,

1259
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it will use some

1260
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
begin-end environment

1261
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
to wrap

1262
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the things here.

1263
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So

1264
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I think the spirit is

1265
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
quite similar to

1266
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
HTML.

1267
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's

1268
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
also close to what I mentioned earlier.

1269
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Its spirit is a bit like

1270
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
writing

1271
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
mathematics

1272
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
or

1273
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
a layout for

1274
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
academic articles.

1275
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It may have more functions.

1276
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Let's see

1277
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
the next one.

1278
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
LaTeX.

1279
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Use

1280
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
the source code

1281
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
control software

1282
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
to pursue

1283
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
the editing problem.

1284
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Thank you.

1285
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I seem to have forgotten to answer a question.

1286
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Do you recommend using

1287
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
text editor software

1288
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
to understand text grammar?

1289
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I didn't seem to answer this one.

1290
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I can go back to

1291
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the previous one.

1292
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
In my opinion,

1293
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
as long as it's easy to use.

1294
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
In fact,

1295
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
these can be recognized.

1296
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The red ones

1297
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
should be able to recognize text grammar.

1298
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Then

1299
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
the right ones

1300
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
may need to install some special

1301
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
kits.

1302
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
The last one is a

1303
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
notebook in Windows.

1304
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So it may

1305
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
not be able to have other kits.

1306
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
The first few editors

1307
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
actually have corresponding kits.

1308
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I can

1309
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
demo it for you.

1310
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I use Visual Studio Code here.

1311
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Then it has a

1312
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
package called

1313
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
LaTeX Workshop.

1314
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It actually

1315
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
writes a little bit like

1316
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
what you see here with

1317
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:40,000
relative

1318
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
conforming

1319
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
instructions.

1320
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Good.

1321
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I don't know if I can turn on the setting.

1322
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Well,

1323
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I usually

1324
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
change it directly.

1325
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Well,

1326
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
if you are interested,

1327
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
you can actually study it a little bit,

1328
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
that is,

1329
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I usually

1330
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
change it directly.

1331
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Well,

1332
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
if you are interested,

1333
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
you can actually study it a little bit,

1334
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that is,

1335
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
you can actually study it a little bit,

1336
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that is,

1337
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Visual Studio Code with

1338
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Latest Workshop.

1339
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
In fact,

1340
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
this kit will help you

1341
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
set things up.

1342
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So when you type directly,

1343
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
you can begin,

1344
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and then it will be generated directly.

1345
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So,

1346
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
although it is a text editor,

1347
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
it is suitable for

1348
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
when you want to use it,

1349
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
sometimes

1350
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
it seems that

1351
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
some environments can be selected.

1352
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Well,

1353
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I believe that

1354
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
these I marked can actually

1355
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
do similar functions.

1356
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
If it is on the left,

1357
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
it should be preset,

1358
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
and there are some relatively

1359
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
grammatical instructions.

1360
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Then I go back to

1361
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the third question.

1362
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Well,

1363
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
if you need more people to edit a document,

1364
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that is,

1365
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
directly using the source code control software to track

1366
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
or there is a test dedicated maintenance platform.

1367
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Well,

1368
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
if you want to be

1369
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
simple and easy to use,

1370
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that is, you don't need to do any settings,

1371
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I personally recommend Overleaf.

1372
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It is that you

1373
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
open an account in Overleaf,

1374
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
you can open a project

1375
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
under this account,

1376
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and then you can share it with others.

1377
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
If other people are editing,

1378
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
in fact,

1379
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I remember that there are some on the right,

1380
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
you can do some discussions,

1381
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
you can do some comments.

1382
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So personally, I think Overleaf

1383
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
is actually a relatively

1384
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
friendly interface

1385
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
for beginners.

1386
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Well,

1387
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
if you use the source code control software

1388
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
to edit documents,

1389
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
that's fine.

1390
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
If you have,

1391
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I just mentioned Git,

1392
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
it should be mentioned in Overleaf.

1393
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Here I mentioned Git,

1394
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that is, it is actually a version control software.

1395
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You can imagine it

1396
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
as controlling

1397
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
a group of text files,

1398
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
which changes it made.

1399
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
If you do

1400
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
the right maintenance,

1401
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
these changes can be

1402
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
shared between multiple users.

1403
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I am using

1404
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Git,

1405
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
but after I write a paragraph,

1406
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I will commit it to

1407
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Git,

1408
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that is, I am now drawing to this extent,

1409
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and then save it first.

1410
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
If there are more users,

1411
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I believe that Git

1412
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
can also do it.

1413
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
The dedicated maintenance platform

1414
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
may be Overleaf.

1415
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So it is more like

1416
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
it depends on

1417
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
which interface

1418
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
users like to use.

1419
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't know if I have answered

1420
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Ian's question.

1421
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
At this stage,

1422
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I would like to

1423
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
stop the recording.

1424
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
If you still have time

1425
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and have questions,

1426
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
you are welcome to

1427
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
discuss freely.

1428
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Thank you for your sharing.
