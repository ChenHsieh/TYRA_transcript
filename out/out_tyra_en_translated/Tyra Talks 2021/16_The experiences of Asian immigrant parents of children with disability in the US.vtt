00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
First of all, I'm Kao Hsien. I'm a Ph.D. student from the University of Brisbane.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm very happy to be able to invite Yiting to talk about today's topic.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
In 2019, Yiting received a Ph.D. from Boston University in the field of Rehabilitation Science.

00:23.000 --> 00:33.000
Since last year, 2020, she has been a Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Behavior and Community Science.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
During her university and master's degree, she studied in the Department of Cognitive Immunotherapy and the Cognitive Immunotherapy Research Institute.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
She has worked in schools, clinics, hospitals, and other places for a long time, about four years.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
She mainly serves children with mental disorders and their families.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Until now, her research interests include the communication of mental disorders, cross-cultural and parents' education experience,

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
and environmental factors affecting the health and quality of mental disorders and family members.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
She is also currently involved in the study of COVID-19, the impact of this epidemic on our mental health,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
as well as the study plan for the integration of mental patients into the care system.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
That's all for my introduction.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
The floor is yours.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yiting, please start your report.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Okay.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
First of all, I'd like to thank Yiting for taking the time to prepare so many things for us,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
as well as some preliminary communication.

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
Also, I'd like to thank the T-Rod platform for allowing us to participate in this event on the weekend.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
I'd like to thank everyone for having the opportunity to listen to this presentation on the weekend.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Let's get started.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Today's topic is,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Is it their country or our home?

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
I'd like to share the quote I got from this interview.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
I think it's a good way to show that as an immigrant living in a new country,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
how does it affect the implementation of their family position in terms of identity?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
How do they practice their family position?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
My main target is the first generation of Asian immigrants in the United States.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Their children have different developmental disabilities.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Later, I will...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Today's presentation...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Okay.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Today, I will talk about...

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
It will take about 10 to 15 minutes.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I will talk about my own experience,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
and why I want to do this topic now,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
and what led me to get to where I am today step by step.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Next, I will talk about the two studies I want to share today.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
These two studies are from my doctoral thesis.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I will talk about the background of these two studies.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Next, I will talk about the first study I did.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
It's a meta-synthesis study.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't know if you are familiar with this type of study.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
I will talk about what it is,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and how I use it.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Lastly, I will talk about a more traditional implementation study.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I will talk about how parents in the U.S.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
help their children with developmental disabilities

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
in the U.S.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
and how they arrange their adult life.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
At the end of this talk,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
we will move on to today's Q&A.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
If you have any questions,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
you can leave them in the chat box.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
If you have any questions,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
you can leave them in the chat box.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You can also leave them in the chat box during the Q&A.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
The first question is,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
as Kou said,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
my university and master's degree are both in Chengda University.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
They are all in Cognitive Therapy.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Regarding Cognitive Therapy,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I think most people have heard about it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I will take this opportunity

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
to give you a brief explanation of Cognitive Therapy.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I think a lot of people

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
will take Occupational Therapy

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
as a direct approach.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I think a lot of people

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
will take Occupational Therapy

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
as a direct approach.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Occupational therapy is not an Job.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
This term, Occupational Therapy,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
is not a job-related word

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
but a meaningful activity to everyone.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
This term, occupational therapy,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
is important to people of different age groups.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
For example,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
if I'm a doctor or a worker,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
meaningful activities to me

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
are going to work, doing research,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
going to class, and so on.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
If I'm in a normal workplace,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
due to physiological, psychological,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
or other reasons,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I can't go to work,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
meaningful activities to me

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
are going to work.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Occupational therapy

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
is also for people

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
who can't go to work.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
For example,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
it's for workers

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
who need to evaluate their functions

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
or help them with their arms

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
or other body functions.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Occupational therapy

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
also helps them adjust

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
their work environment

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
so that they can go back to work.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
For children,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
meaningful activities to them

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
are playing,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
socializing with others,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
going to school,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
or even daily life management.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Can they do these things?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
These are meaningful activities to them.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
At this point,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'd like to talk about

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
the scope of occupational therapy.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's widely defined in our field.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
However,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
people who are not in this field

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
may not have a clear understanding

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
of this term.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
It may be more defined as

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
occupational therapy.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
As occupational therapists,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
there are two ways

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
to help our clients.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We care about

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
the three circles

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
in the lower right corner.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We care about

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
whether the person,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
the environment,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and the occupation

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
can overlap well

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
and whether the person

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
can do meaningful things

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
in their daily life.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
In addition to

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
personal adjustment,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
we may also adjust

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
the environment.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We may also

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
help the person

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
to adjust

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
meaningful activities

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
so that they can do

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
what they want to do

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
but may need

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
a new way

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
or a new schedule.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
That's the concept

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
of occupational therapy.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
In Taiwan,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
once you graduate as an occupational therapist,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
you can get a national license

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
to work as

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
an occupational therapist.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
When I graduated from college,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I went to a vocational school

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
and worked as

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
an occupational therapist.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I mainly did early therapy.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Early therapy may be defined

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
as before the age of three

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
or six.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Later, I did rehabilitation

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
for children who were

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
in the early stages of learning.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Later,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
after I graduated from college,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I did other occupational therapies

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
in Taipei and Tainan.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
For example,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I worked as an occupational therapist

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
in a school

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
or in a traditional

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
rehabilitation center

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
in a hospital.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I also had experience

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
interacting with patients

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
as an adult.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I also worked

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
in a nursing center

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
as an occupational therapist.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I also had experience

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
interacting with patients

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
as an adult.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I mainly worked with

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
children with mental disabilities

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
and their families.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
At that time,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
when I was working in Taipei,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
we had a non-official

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
parent support group.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
In Taiwan,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
under the health insurance system,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
hospitals usually provide

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
one-on-one

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
or group therapy

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
to children.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
As a therapist,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
it is quite common

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
to see children

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
come to you

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
once a week

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
for 30 minutes

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
or even an hour.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
It may be a little more than that,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
but that's about it.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
We can recognize

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
that if we can

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
make a long-term

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
or effective change

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
in their daily lives,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
it is a very important step

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
because parents spend

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
most of their time

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
interacting with their children.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Parents know their children's

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
strengths and weaknesses,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
preferences,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
and where they need to improve.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
At that time,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
we started

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
the parent support group.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
In fact,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
parents have a lot of

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
interesting motivation to develop.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Here is a simple example.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
For example,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
a parent wants

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
her child to help

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
her child practice

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
taking a bath.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Does the child's

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
bathroom need some adjustments?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Does the child need

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
to practice

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
taking a bath?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
However,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
another parent

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
heard our discussion

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
in the group.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Her child is already

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
in the third grade,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
but she did not realize

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
that children can

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
practice taking a bath.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
She heard this

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
through this chat

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
and then came to

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
discuss with us

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
and found that

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
this is one of the goals

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
she and her child

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
want to achieve.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So we started to

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
discuss with her.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
In my experience,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
most of the time

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
parents only

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
have one or two children.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
They may not have

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
many opportunities

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
to interact with other parents.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
However,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
when we set up

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
this group,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
there were not many

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
relevant evidences

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
about how to

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
effectively provide

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
this kind of

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
parent support group

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
in our field.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
This is why

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I was interested

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
in reading the

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
doctor's class

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
to find out

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
how to

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
develop an

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
evidence-based

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
support group

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
for our clients.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I need to know

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
what I need to know

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
and what research

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I need to do

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
in order to

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
know whether

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
my intervention

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
is effective or not.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
So in 2014

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
and 2019,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I joined

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Youth and Young Adult

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Empowerment, Leadership,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
and Learning.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
We focus on

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
young adults with

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
mental disabilities

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
between 14 and

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
20 years old.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
They are not like

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
me when I was in Taiwan.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I was in primary school.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
There are relatively

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
few people in Taiwan

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
with disabilities.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Through the experience

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
of the doctor's class,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I had the opportunity

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
to learn more about

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
young adults.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
This influenced

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
my understanding

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
of the age group

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
in my doctoral thesis.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
My interests

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
in this research

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
are those

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
related to

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
education and

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
immigration.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I'm also interested

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
in cross-cultural experiences.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I hope that

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
my research and

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
future research

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
will be in the same

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
field.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
In 2020,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I started

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
my research

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
called

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Health Behavior and

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Behavior.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
My research

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
is related to

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
suicide and

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
mental illness.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
My current boss

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
is also doing

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
qualitative research

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and quantitative research.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I hope that

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
my research can

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
help patients

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
with mental illness.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Through this opportunity,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I hope that

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
my research can

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
help patients

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
with mental illness.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Next,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I will talk about

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
the two research

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I mentioned today.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
First,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I think parental involvement

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
is important.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Some people

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
may be involved

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
from the perspective of

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
their brothers and sisters.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Some people

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
may be involved

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
from the perspective

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
of their teachers

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
such as

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
doctors

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and so on.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I'm interested in

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
the same thing

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I mentioned earlier.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I'm interested in

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
the same thing

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
such as

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
parent involvement

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
that can lead to

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
positive effects

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
in the child's

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
social, emotional,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
and functional outcomes.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Developmental disabilities

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
happened

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
when the child was

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
18 years old.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
So it happened

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
quite early

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and affected

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
the child for a long time.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You may

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
hear of

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
intellectual disability

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
or autism

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
or hearing loss

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
or mental illness

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and so on.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
These are the so-called

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
developmental disabilities.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Simply put,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
according to

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
my research in the U.S.,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
there is

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
a law

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
on the right

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
to learn

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
for people with

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
mental disabilities

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
called

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Individuals with Disabilities

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Education Improvement Act,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
or IDEA.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
The law

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
ensures that

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
people with disabilities

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
can access

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
the resources

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
they need

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
at their local

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
public schools

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
or private schools.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
The law

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
clearly states

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
that parents

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
have the right

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
to participate

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
in the child's education.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
For example,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
if the child's

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
private education

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
is related to

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
the child's

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
private education,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
parents need to

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
participate.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Of course,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
it's a different matter

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
whether parents can

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
participate,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
but the school

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
must provide

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
the platform

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
for the child

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
to learn.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
The number of

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Asian immigrants

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
in the U.S.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
grew rapidly

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
from more than

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
2 million in 1980

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
to more than 12 million

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
in 2014.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
The number

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
increased rapidly

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
in 2021.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
In the past,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
the number

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
of Asian immigrants

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
in the U.S.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
was estimated

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
to exceed

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
the number of

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Hispanic immigrants

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
in 2025.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
the number

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
of Asian immigrants

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
in the U.S.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
grew rapidly

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
and parents

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
couldn't provide

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
the appropriate services

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
for their children.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
if we

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
don't have

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
the appropriate

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
understanding of

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
the population,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
there will be

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
some difficulties

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
in the service.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
In the past,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
when Asian parents

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
received education-related services,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
they encountered

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
more obstacles.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
For example,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
they started

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
to receive services

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
later than others,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
or they spent

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
less time

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
in the education process

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
than others,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
etc.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
In the past,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
the cultural difference

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
between Asian and

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Hispanic parents

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
was reduced.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
if we eliminate

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
the cultural difference,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
will the obstacles

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
disappear naturally?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
But is there

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
a day when

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
there is no cultural difference?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
This is a question

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
worth thinking about.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
In the past,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Asian parents

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
rarely faced

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
the barriers

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
they encountered.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
why did they

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
choose these methods?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
So,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
here are some

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
knowledge gaps in the past.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
First,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
they focused on barriers.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Second,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
these barriers

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
are only related to service providers.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
In fact,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
there are many things

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
in people's lives.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
As I said in the beginning,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
the interaction with service providers

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
is important.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
However,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
there are many other things

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
and times in people's lives.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
In the past,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
they focused on

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
young children.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
So,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
in the past,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
they focused on

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
young children

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
before high school

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
or high school.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
In the past,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
they focused on

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
what they wanted to do

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and how to achieve

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
their goals.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
In the past,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
immigration is

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
a process

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
that changes

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
every day.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
It's not like

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
you came to the US for 3 years

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
or Europe for 5 years

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and you achieved

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
cultural adaptation.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
In fact,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
you learn new things

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
every day.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You have new understanding

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
of the country

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
because of the interaction.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
You may be

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
culturally adapted

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
in the past.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
However,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
there is little research

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
about the changes

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
in the process of

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
cultural adaptation.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
For example,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
the first basic thing

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
is the ability to speak.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
As you stay in the US

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
or abroad longer,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
your ability to speak may change.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Then,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
your understanding of

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
cultural adaptation may improve.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Next,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
you need to understand

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
the concept of mental disability.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
This concept may come from

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
your country or your values.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Your values may be affected

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
by the environment

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
or the mainstream

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
of society.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Next,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
when you're a parent,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
you don't know

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
what you want to do.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Many people say

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
they learned

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
how to be a parent

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
by being a parent.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
In fact,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
there are many changes

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
in the process of

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
mental disability.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
However,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
there is little research about it.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
In my research,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I want to use

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
role theory and acculturation theory

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
as my theoretical background.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
In the first part,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
the role theory says

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
the role of a parent

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
is related to

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
the behavior

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
of the child.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
However,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
the behavior of the child

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
may be different

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
from the behavior

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
of the society.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
It may affect

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
the role of the child.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
There may be different adjustments.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Next,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
we know

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
the role of a parent

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
is related to

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
the society.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
If we want to understand immigrants,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
we need to consider

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
their cultural background

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
to see if it

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
affects their

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
beliefs

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
and behaviors.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I think

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
this part is very simple.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
We want to know

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
how the parents

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
in the U.S.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
help their children

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
to find resources

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
or use resources.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
What are their experiences?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I will introduce

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
these two researches one by one.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Through these two researches,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I want to respond to

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
the biggest goal.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Next,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
let's talk about

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
meta-analysis.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I want to explain

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
what is meta-analysis.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I think you often hear

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
about meta-analysis.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
It is a systematic review

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
and systematic analysis.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Meta-analysis is

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
about qualitative research.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Meta-analysis is

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
about quantitative research.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Meta-analysis is

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
about qualitative research.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
The data of qualitative research

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
comes from other researches

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
related to the topic

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
you are interested in.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You can use the data

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
to make

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
the second analysis.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Meta-analysis is not

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
just about

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
organizing the researches

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
related to the topic

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
in the past.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It emphasizes

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
that you need

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
a new interpretation

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
to explain the researches

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
related to the topic

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
you are interested in.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
The purpose of meta-analysis

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
is to put the qualitative researches

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
you have published

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
in the past

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
in a new perspective

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
to interpret them.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
to interpret them.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Through this way,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
we can generate

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
theoretical frameworks.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
These frameworks

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
can provide

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
new ideas

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
or new guidance

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
to future researches

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
or clinical work.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
to future researches

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
or clinical work.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Meta-analysis

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
was developed in 1997.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Meta-analysis was developed in 1997.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I just simply

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
selected PubMed as a database.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Meta-analysis has been

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
developing step by step.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't know if you have

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the chance to see

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
similar researches.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
If not,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I believe there will be

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
more opportunities

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
to see similar researches in the future.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Some researches

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
develop meta-analysis

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
and meta-synthesis

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
at the same time

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
in the same paper.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Meta-analysis

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Meta-analysis

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Meta-analysis

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
aims to develop

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
a theoretical framework

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
to describe

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
parents' experience

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
when accessing

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
or using

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
related services.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
This research

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
was published last year

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
in Qualitative Health Research.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
If you are interested,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
you can download it.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
If you don't have access,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I can provide full text.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Meta-analysis

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Meta-analysis

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
is a systematic review.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We develop

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
search terms

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
and put them into different databases.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
We found

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
more than 800 articles.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
We included some inclusion criteria,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
such as peer-reviewed articles

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
written in English,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
samples,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
subjects,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
and topics.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
We included

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
11 articles

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
in the 800 articles.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
The translation

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
is based on

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
the synthesis of 11 articles.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
There are

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
more than

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
170 parents

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
in Meta-analysis.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
It was published

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
in 1987,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
more than 30 years ago.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
We published

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
9 articles

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
between 2000 and 2010.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
The frequency is not high.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
The latest article was published in 2016.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
However, the search

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
was checked again in 2020.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Maybe there is a new article,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
but we didn't include it.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Most of the articles

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
were published

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
between 12 and 12 years old.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
There are 7 articles

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
between 12 and 20 years old.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Only one article

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
included an older child.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
However,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
the topic was not

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
targeted at the child,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
but the child was older.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
In the past,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
most of the articles

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
were written in Korean,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
some were in Chinese,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and some were

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
combined samples

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
from Japan,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
South Asia,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
and other countries.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
These articles

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
were mostly in-person interviews.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Some were done

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
by phone interviews,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
and some were done

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
by other methods.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
It is worth mentioning

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
that most of the articles

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
were done

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
in a short period of time.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Especially,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
if the interview

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
was a complicated one,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and we only had

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
a 30-minute call

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
or an hour-long interview,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
the depth of the topic

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
was limited.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
It was a pity

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
for the research

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
in the past.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Most of the articles

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
were published in the East Coast,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
the West Coast,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
and Chicago,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
which is where

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Asian-Americans live.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Now,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
let's talk about

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
my research findings.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
First,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
we were curious

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
about the role of parents

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
in the process.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
We analyzed

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
that the main goal

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
of parents

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
is to help their children

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
to grow up

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
and live a happy life.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
The role

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
of parents

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
is multifaceted.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
The role of parents

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
is multifaceted.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
The role of parents

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
is multifaceted.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
The role of parents

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
is multifaceted.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
It is the role of parents

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
to help their children

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
to plan their future.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
It is the role of parents

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
to help their children

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
to plan their future.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Many times,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
other kids

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
don't have bruises.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Even if they only have

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
one child,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
they still have

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
some things

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
to do

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
such as

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
their parents.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
These things are

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
related to each other.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
For example,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
this father said

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
that he wanted to

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
buy a house

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
before he knew

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
about supportive living.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Then he could help

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
his children to

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
run a group home.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I don't know if you are familiar with

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
a group home.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
It is a type of living

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
where 4 to 6

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
or 3 to 6

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
adults with neurodegenerative disorder

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
can live in a

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
apartment.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
However, the government

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
won't pay their rent.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
They may have a chance

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
to find a worker

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
who will come

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
once a day

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
to help them

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
with their daily life,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
such as cooking

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
or washing clothes.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
It depends on

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
the needs of each group home.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
This father

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
later realized

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
that he had

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
improved his knowledge

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
about supportive living.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Otherwise,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
he planned to

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
buy a house

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and run a group home.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
This quote shows

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
that these aspects

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
are related to each other.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Next,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
we are curious about

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
the process

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
of the paternity.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
What does it look like?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
The first thing we see

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
is that it is

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
a continuous process.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Usually, it does not

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
end in a circle.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It may go on

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
until the parents

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
can't continue.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Or the parents

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
have a clear plan

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
for their children's future.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Then it may

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
stop in this circle.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Otherwise, it is

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
an endless cycle.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
However, in each cycle,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
they may experience

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
whether their plan

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
is successful.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
If it is successful,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
they may

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
achieve their goal.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
However, if

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
their plan is not successful,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
they may experience

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
dissatisfaction.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
They may face

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
dissatisfaction

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
through coping strategies.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
This coping strategy

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
may influence

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
their next action.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
In this process,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
we can see that

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
the parents

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
change their

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
coping strategies

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
as time goes by.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
For example,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
they may decide

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
not to attend

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
the meeting.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
The parents

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
may go to the meeting

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
at the beginning.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
However, they may

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
change their

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
coping strategies

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
based on

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
their past

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
interactions

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
with the environment.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
In the case of

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
individual factors,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
we can see that

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
there are several factors.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
For example,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
the age of the children

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
may influence

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
their actions.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
In addition,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
some parents

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
may know

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
how far they can go

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
based on their

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
rights as parents.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
For example,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
they may ask

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
for their rights.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
This may influence

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
their next action.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
In the case of

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Korean immigrants,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
their parents may

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
say that

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
their parents

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
respect their

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
profession and rights

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
based on their

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
traditional culture.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Therefore,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
they may not

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
ask questions

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
because

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
their culture

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
is different from

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
the education of

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
their native country.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
This may influence

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
their actions

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
In addition,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
they may use

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
coping strategies

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
based on their

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
past interactions

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
with the environment.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
In the case of

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
self-reliance,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
they may not

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
rely on others

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
to solve the problem

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
but rely on themselves.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Some people may

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
look for resources

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
and coping strategies

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
based on their

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
past interactions

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
with the environment.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
However,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
this does not mean

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
they are self-reliant.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
They may just

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
measure what happens

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
in their life.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
The best solution

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
is to compromise.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It is also interesting

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
to see how they

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
respond to the

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
expectations of

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
immigrants.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
However,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
everyone has

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
different expectations.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
For example,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
some parents

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
have learned

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
how to interact

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
with their

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
American parents.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Some parents

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
may feel

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
that their country

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
has given them

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
a lot of resources

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
and they should

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
be a good immigrant.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Therefore,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
everyone may have

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
different expectations.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
These factors

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
may influence

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
their actions.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
In the process,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
many system factors

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
may influence

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
their behavior.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
For example,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
some parents

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
may have

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
specific guidelines

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
or rules

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
when interacting

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
with their

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
parents.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
For immigrants,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
social support

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
is very important

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
for all parents.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Especially for immigrants

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
who interact

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
with school or hospital

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
based on their needs.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
For example,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
language accommodation

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
is very important

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
for immigrants.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
It is important

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
for immigrants

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
to know

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
if the information

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
they provide

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
is good

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
or not.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
For example,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
if the information

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
they provide

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
is good

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
or not,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
they may feel

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
that the information

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
they provide

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
is helpful.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
They may feel

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
that the information

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
they provide

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
is good

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
or not.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
In the past,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
they may use

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
the information

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
their parents understand

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
to explain to their parents.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
In the process,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
they may feel

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
that their parents' opinion

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
is important

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and they really

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
want to hear

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and value their parents' opinion.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They may feel

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
that their parents

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
are a support

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
and sometimes a barrier.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
They may feel that

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
the system factor

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
needs to be considered.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
This is the first part

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
of the study.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
There are several

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
points of discussion.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
We can see that

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
their parents' role

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
is very adaptive.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
We can see that

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
they use various coping strategies

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
based on their cultural

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
adaptation and experience.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
In fact,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
we can see that

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
their role

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
is not that different

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
from those

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
non-immigrant parents.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
In fact,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
we can see that

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
their role

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
is not that different

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
from those

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
non-immigrant parents.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
As parents,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
no matter where you are,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
there is a lot of

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
commonality.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
They are all parents in the U.S.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
so the environment

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
and the identity

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
of being a parent

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
may be similar

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
when they face

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
what they want to do.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
The problem is

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
that they have similar goals.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
However,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
their approach

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
may be different.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
We can compare

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
past studies.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Some studies

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
show that

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
when parents advocate

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
for their children

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
or families,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
their parents

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
tend to

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
hope that

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
they sound nice.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
In the U.S.,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
non-immigrant parents

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
tend to say

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
that they want to fight

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
for their kids

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
in the process of

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
advocating.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Of course,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
this is not true

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
for everyone.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
However,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
we can learn from

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
their experiences

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
that

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
their goal

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
may be different

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
when they face

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
cultural background.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
After

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
doing this meta-analysis,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
we found some

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
limitations of past studies.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
So we decided

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
to conduct

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
a qualitative study

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
to understand

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
what I could not understand

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
in the previous meta-analysis.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
In this meta-analysis study,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
we found that

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
adults

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
had less experience

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
than children,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
mostly before

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
they left the special education system.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
By the way,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
in the U.S.,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
the special education system

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
is required to provide

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
services to children

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
before they graduate

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
from high school

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
or become

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
22 years old.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
However,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
in the U.S.,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
the special education system

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
is not as perfect

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
as in the U.S.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
when it comes to

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
school regulations

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and responsibilities.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
In the U.S.,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
the special education system

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
relies on parents

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
to plan

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
what to do

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
in the future.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Even for

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
non-immigrant families,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
it is difficult

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
for them to transition

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
to adulthood.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Many researches

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
suggest that

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
it sounds easy,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
but it takes

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
3 to 5 years

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
for the parents

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
to transition

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
to adulthood.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
It is a challenge.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
In the past,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Asian immigrants

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
were considered

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
to be super big

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
in Asia,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
including East Asia,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Southeast Asia,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
South Asia,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
East Asia, West Asia,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and so on.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
However,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
in the past,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
the cultural background

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
of every Asian country

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
is very different.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
If you compare

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
all of them,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
there may be some problems.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
For example,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
in the past few years,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
some organizations

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
advocating for Asian

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
people in the U.S.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
have said that

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
people in the U.S.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
who need help

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
are smart

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
and have good social status.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
They don't need much help.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
However,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
the majority of

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Asian people

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
are from East Asia,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
such as Japan,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
South Korea, Taiwan,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
China,

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
and so on.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
They are able to

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
seek better education

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and make money.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
In fact,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
many Asian people

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
from Cambodia,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Vietnam,

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
and so on

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
are also Asian.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
However,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
due to the label,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
they are unable

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
to get the support

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
they need.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Recently,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
some organizations

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
are trying to

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
put them under

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
the same umbrella term.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
In my opinion,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
in the second phase

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
of the study,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
we want to

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
have a clearer and

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
narrower group

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
to focus on

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
the experience of

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
the adult period.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
The narrative study

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'll talk about later

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
is about Chinese immigrants

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
who are already

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
in the adult period.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
The transition

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
to adulthood

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
is defined as

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
the transition from

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
high school to

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
the adult period.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
The IDEA requires

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
the school to provide

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
the relevant services.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
However,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
the implementation

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
is not perfect.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
If there is a

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
parental involvement,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
the post-school education

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
or employment outcome

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
of the child

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
will be better.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Why do I want

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
to talk about

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Chinese-speaking immigrants?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
First,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
as you can see

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
on the right,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Chinese is a commonly

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
used language in the U.S.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Among the immigrants,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
the green and purple

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
represent the ability

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
to speak English

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
or to speak English

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
fluently.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
In contrast,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Chinese-speaking immigrants

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
are more likely to

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
speak English fluently.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Vietnamese immigrants

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
are more likely to speak English fluently.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Second,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
we are a research tool

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
so the degree of

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
my language and culture

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
will affect

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
my ability to

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
understand the phenomenon.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
As an international student

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
and as a

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Chinese-speaking immigrant

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
who grew up

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
in Taiwan,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
I have the opportunity

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
to live abroad.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
To be honest,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I am not a real immigrant

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
because I have no experience

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
in Chinese culture

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
and my own language background.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
To sum up,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I decided to

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
research Chinese-speaking immigrants

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
if I wanted to

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
learn more about

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Chinese-speaking immigrants.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The purpose of this research

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
is to understand

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
the experience of Chinese-speaking immigrants.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I adopted a narrative approach

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
so that parents

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
can interpret their past experiences.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Through the narrative approach,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
we can learn more about

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
their current and past experiences

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and how these experiences

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
affect their values,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
thoughts, and behaviors.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
My inclusion criteria

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
is that

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
a Chinese-speaking immigrant

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
needs to have a young adult child

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
who is 18 to 35 years old

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
and has a hearing impairment.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
If a Chinese-speaking immigrant

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
comes from a country

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
where Chinese is spoken,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
some of the people

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I interviewed

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
were native speakers.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
As an executive researcher,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I can't speak Cantonese

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
to some of them

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
because of the limitations

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
of my research.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
However, most of them

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
can communicate better

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
in English

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
through Mandarin Chinese.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I can't exclude

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
some families

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
who have complicated medical needs.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
If a family member

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
needs a 24-hour ventilator,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
their lifestyle

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
will be different

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
from the family experience

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
of an adult

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
in a community.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
In this research,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
we excluded this type of family.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
The convenient sample

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
is the one I found

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
in my book.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
During my research,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
we found five cases.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Most of them

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
immigrated to the U.S.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
from 1983 to 1994.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
They were

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
about 20 to 32 years old

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
when they immigrated.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
One of them was a father.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Four of them were mothers.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
One of the children

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
was a girl.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
The other four were boys.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Three of them

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
had different levels of autism.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Some of them were highly-functioning

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and could go to a high school.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Some of them

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
had a special education system.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Some of them

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
had a combination of intellectual disabilities.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
The other two

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
had cerebral palsy and intellectual disabilities.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
William's syndrome

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
is also a genetic disease

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
with some intellectual disabilities.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Only one of the parents

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
moved to the U.S.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
because his child

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
was already 8 years old

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
in Taiwan.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
He thought

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
the U.S. could provide

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
better special education services

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
for his child.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
The other four families

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
immigrated to the U.S.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
for other reasons,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
such as work or education.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
They had children

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
after they got married

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
in Taiwan.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I had three interviews

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
with the parents

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
in my data collection.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Each interview

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
took about two hours

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and each interview

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
took about a week.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I met the parents

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
in person three times

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
and the interview took about

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
a month.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The first interview

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
was about self-introduction

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and their family background

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and their views on disabilities

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and their goals

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
for their children.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
The second interview

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
was about taking photos

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and asking the parents

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
to talk more

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
about their stories

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
in the photos.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
We also asked

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
about the impact

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
on their environment

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
during the interview.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
The third interview

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
was about time

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and their past

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and present.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
We asked the parents

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
to reflect on

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
their past

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
and present

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and ask the parents

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
to reflect on

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
their past

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and present

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
and ask the parents

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
to reflect on

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
their past

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and present

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
and ask the parents

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
to reflect on

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
their past

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and present

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
and ask the parents

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
to reflect on

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
their past

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
and present

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
and ask the parents

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
to reflect on

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
their past

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and present

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
These are photos provided by the parents

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
For example, this parent

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
mentioned that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
her child is a volunteer

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
in the hospital

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
where she goes every morning

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
and every day

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Another parent

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
mentioned that

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
her child is in his early 20s

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
when he graduated from high school

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This is very important to her

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
and she wants to talk about it

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Another parent mentioned

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
that she will participate in

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
community activities

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
with her child

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
for the disabled

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
This is a community activity

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
where they go out

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
and do barbecue

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
It is a community activity

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
where they go out

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
and do barbecue

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
They may discuss

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
the needs of their adult needs

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
These two visual cues

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
are what I will use

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
in the interview

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I will show this visual cue

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
to the parents

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I think this design

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
is related to the background

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
of the disability therapist

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
We are used to

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
providing various materials

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
in the communication

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
or service

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
so that people with different needs

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
have a better chance

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
to understand

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
what we are going to talk about

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
We can help them

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
visualize

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I think this is related

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
to the traditional

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
one-to-one interview

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
We may see more

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
We use different materials

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
to promote this

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
In terms of data analysis

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
After the interview

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
What did the parent

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
say in the interview

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
What did the parent say

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
in the interview

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Why did the parent say

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
these things

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
and how did the parent

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
say these things

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I can't talk about

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
the data analysis in detail

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
But if you are interested

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I have some extra reports

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I put them at the end of the report

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
We can discuss

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Finally, I will compare

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
what the parent said

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Let's jump to the

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
finding part

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
The first one is

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
what they want to do

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
In comparison to the

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Meta-Fitness Study

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
They focus on

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
their adult life

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
There are two things

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
they want to do

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
The first one is

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I want to help my child

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
develop independent living skills

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
so that they can live independently

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
The second one is

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
I want to help my child

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
develop independent adult life

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Finally, I want to

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
help my child

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
live a happy and meaningful life

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
live a happy and meaningful life

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
In this process

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
We see several themes

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The first one is

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
their life

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
The first one is

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
their life

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
The first one is

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
their life

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
How do they deal with

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
the environment

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
The environment

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
their life

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Disagreements

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Perceptions

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
How do they deal with

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
the situation

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
about immigration

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
How do they feel

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
about

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
their country

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
This is just a demo

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
It may be more complicated than this

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
But what I want to say is

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
There may be his family

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
There are experts he interacts with

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Then there are also his service providers

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
There may also be this society

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
for

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
The attitude of the society

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
towards the family

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The community he lives in

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
His resources and the whole

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Maybe the related policy in the United States

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
For him, it may all affect

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
the role of his father-in-law

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
For example, this parent said

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
When his child graduated from high school

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
He gave a speech

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Then he said I was very surprised

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
about his performance

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
His teacher prepared a speech for him

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Because of this experience, I started to feel

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
In fact, it is possible to help my child

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
to develop self-innovation

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
He may not have this idea

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
He just thought

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
That's what he wanted to do

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
But because he saw this experience

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
He saw the school teacher

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
The school teacher provided this platform

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
The school teacher also showed

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
In fact, if there is appropriate support

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
In fact, the child can

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Speak out what they want to say

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
So these

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Things have affected him

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
How can he help his child

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Just mentioned

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
In addition to the passive influence

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Parents also feel

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
They have some active influence on their circle of life

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
For example, there is a parent

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Some parents may

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
It should be said that the first

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
We see all the parents

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
They all feel

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
They play the role of this father-in-law

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
It's very important to their children

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
The second is that some parents think

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Because this world can't always

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Adapt to you

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So we should be the one

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Learn how to adapt to this world

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
There are also some

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
In the story of their parents

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
You can see their

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Understanding of the world is more human

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
As long as

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I have a heart

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
I can do what I want to do

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So for example

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
This parent

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I just got two

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
In the story

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
They are very sure

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
They will say that I am very sure

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I 100% believe

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
It won't help my child

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Usually this kind of plot

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
They only happen

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
They are describing the interaction between him and his child

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
But he may not necessarily use such a plot

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Describe his interaction with other people

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
It's just that we talk through the parents

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
We can see

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Parents actually know their children very well

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Their relationship with their children

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
To put it bluntly

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
This thing

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Their children are also their

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
The most important protagonist in the story

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Okay, then

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Some parents say

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
He may have to adapt to this world

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
For example, this parent said

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I think this society is willing to accept

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
This is what he said to his child

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
He told me

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
He said he thought this society was willing to accept you

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
It's already good

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Because this world can't adjust for you forever

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So you have to learn how to adapt to this world

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
This thing may be

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Parents have different views on obstacles

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Some parents think

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Because the problem is our own problem

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's my own deficiency

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Caused this situation

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So I shouldn't have asked

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This society does too much for me

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
But not every parent thinks so

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Some parents may think

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Yes, my child has such an obstacle

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But I think this society should

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Let everyone have the right to survive

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Plus we have such a law

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So in fact

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The school should also be able to do more

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So that my child can live

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think this view

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Also comes from their experience

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This system is between

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
There are some limitations

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
They may not be able to overcome

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Then I just talked about

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
This kind of family

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
For example, I saw parents

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
One of the parents even moved his whole family

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
To the United States

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But of course this is a more specific example

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But like other parents

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Moving in different schools is also very common

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Or they may also talk about

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
There are many other families in my school

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
They are all because

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
This school has good resources

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So they will move here

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
So they are actively seeking

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
For their family

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
The most beneficial conditions

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Then choose to start a family business in this place

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Sometimes they

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Except for themselves

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I feel like

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I am a role that is accepted

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Sometimes they can actually switch to

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
He also thinks that relying on his own ability

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Is able to change this society

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Or change the thoughts of other parents

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Like this

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
He said that I often take my son

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
To participate in community activities

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
In addition to the general public

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
There are also quite a few politicians

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I hope they can see my son

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So they will know more

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Disabled people are in need in society

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And his preface is that there are votes

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So he hopes politicians

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Can pay more attention to these issues

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Then he also said

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
He saw more community parents

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
In fact, there is this need

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
He also felt that he had the opportunity

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
To help others through his philosophy

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
He did not think of his own life

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Can achieve this thing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
He now feels that this is his life

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Very important thing

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Good

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Then again, for them to immigrate

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
In fact, most parents

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Still talk about

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
For immigrants

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
He is more difficult

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But although it is more difficult

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Because they still feel

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Most parents still feel

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They will choose this place

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Or because they recognize

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
In this environment in the United States

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
For disability

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
This thing is more positive

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So this thing

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Also a big influence

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
They choose this place

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Take this place as their home

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
For example, this parent

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
In their country

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We have to bow our heads

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I often feel that I am an outsider

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Then he also talked about

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
The story of his child's graduation

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
He said

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
When my child graduated from high school

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I once discussed with other classmates

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Can we make a group home together

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But those white parents

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Don't want to talk to me

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
They probably just think

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I can't speak English

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
This parent also said

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
You can't rely on others

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
But it doesn't mean that these things are negative

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
But when you solve the problem

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
In fact, you will learn a lot

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Then this thing

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I think these quotes

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Not only this parent

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Also called other parents

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I feel like I'm an outsider

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
This feeling

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
In fact, there will be a lot of challenges

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So for immigrants

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Many things he is

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
It's more difficult

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
But their parents

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
When it comes to American society

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Also talked about a lot of content

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
For example, they feel

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
American society

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Their views on disability

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
May be much more positive than their native country

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Like a parent

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
He just came to the United States

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Just found out

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
These schools

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
They will also be

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
At the end of the semester

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
The child will perform on stage

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
He thinks he has never thought

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
His children can also

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Even children with special needs

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Can also have their own stage

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
He thinks these things may come from

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Americans

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Or the whole American society

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
The awareness of disability may be different

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Like this parent

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
He also said that his children participated

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
For them

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
A very important program

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
He interpreted

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
The reason they chose this name

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
They believe

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Although everyone's ability

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
May be different

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
If they have the right needs

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Can still live like ordinary people

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Then he felt

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
This spirit is influenced by American culture

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
He also felt

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
About the training of disabled people

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
There should be no better place

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Unless you find a better place in the future

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Otherwise, our whole family will live here

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
This parent

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
He used the word

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
He is a Chinese immigrant

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
He also had the opportunity

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Under his setting conditions

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
If you want to be in China

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
There is a good development

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But he felt

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
The training of disabled people is better

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Like some parents

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Although they are

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Foreigners or immigrants

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But he thinks we are already

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
In the United States

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
We also want to participate in this society

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Invite other members of the community

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Participate in local affairs in the United States

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
These things

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Like what they said here

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The so-called influence of American culture

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
May be with the American disability movement

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Maybe from the 60s

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Starting in the 50s and 60s

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And their so-called

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
This part of human rights

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Will affect their whole country

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Policy planning for mental health

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Then

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Also mentioned by many parents

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It is quite common in the United States

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
There are all kinds of support groups

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
They rarely see in native countries

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Through this narrative research

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Then we are more open

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Let the parents talk to them

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
A more impressive story

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Then we can see more

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
They are in life

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Important things to them

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Maybe not just in the past research

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Is the person who provides the service

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
There are also some other things

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think using narrative research

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
The uniqueness

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You can see different things from him

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Then we can see that

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
They can also be in their narrative

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
In the process of seeing their

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Concept

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Or what is the behavior

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Based on their experience with this new country

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Accumulated years of experience

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And these interpretations affect their current

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Interaction

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Then this overall is

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We are back to these two studies

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Then there are several

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
What we see is that the parents are actually

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Uh

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
As a parent

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Their willfulness is actually through

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
They met these challenges

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
There is a chance to show

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That may be

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Because the past research is more

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
OK we are

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Just keep documenting these barriers

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But in fact, if you pay attention to the parents

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
What are the main things

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Then they are actually very willful

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Even if they may encounter some challenges

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
They still have different

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
For example, coping strategies

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Or they may even be able to

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Further affect their right to life

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
What I want to say next is actually

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Uh, because I just started

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
What we are talking about is our professional thinking

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Very concerned about the environment

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Interaction between occupation

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So for example

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
They both

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
In the study, we see that

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
What are the things in this environment

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
In fact, the impact is quite large

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
But every parent

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
They may

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
According to their current state

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Or the environment around them

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Their everyone to face the environment

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Interactive mode is also quite different

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
May still have their own

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Uniqueness

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So like this kind of research

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It's just very simple here

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Summarize this kind of research

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Maybe it can be used

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
After we know so much

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Then the next part may be

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
We represent that in fact

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
A lot of parents are immigrating

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
They actually need a lot

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Some environmental resources

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Let them know more

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
What resources are available in this environment

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
There is also a chance to meet

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Other parents

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
But if we have more in our environment

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Similar parent center

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It may be quite helpful

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Then come again

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
These service providers

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
One or two really

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Make them feel bad

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But for them

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Even after many years

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It's still very strong

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I think this thing

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Although in the past research

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
There is also a constant mention of this matter

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
But maybe we can do this kind of research

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Emphasize the importance of this matter again

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
We can also review some past documents

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
How do we create this

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
The so-called sham free environment

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Can do

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The next is because the parents

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The uniqueness of their experience

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And they are actually very capable

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
They are not just people who need help

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
They can actively participate in many things

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
So maybe for them

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
More effective intervention

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It's kind of like a coach

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
For example, he is a sports player

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
He himself actually

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I know what I'm doing

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
He has a lot of his

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Ability to achieve

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But if there is one at this time

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
We can discuss with him together

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Then evaluate and help him

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
He said which things you can

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Think about it again

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Maybe their

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
On this matter

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
More effective

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Can be promoted

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
As much as they can

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
What they want to do

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Except for these things

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I think we do anything

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You can't get out of this historical moment

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Like the recent

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
These hate crimes

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Based on some prejudices

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Although it's not

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Today's research

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
But for a long time

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
It's these Asians

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Being regarded as

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The so-called model minority

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Or like everyone

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
There is no need for their own needs

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
To actively advocate this traditional

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
It may make a lot of people

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Even if you want to understand

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
They understand this group

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
If you don't have the opportunity

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
To let these groups

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If the voice is heard

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Then you are more likely to

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Understand each other

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
These prejudices may exist for a long time

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Including what I just said

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Not just these East Asian countries

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Maybe other Asian countries

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Their needs are harder to hear

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So I think

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I hope this kind of research

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It can be promoted

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Different researchers or different

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
They are different

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Cultural background

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
There are these ways

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Can let everyone know

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
This type of research

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I think it's not just in the United States

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
In Taiwan, there are actually quite a lot of

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But relatively little

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
For example, Taiwan is actually

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
An immigration society

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Just say that our immigration structure

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
May not be the same as the United States

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
In fact, from Taiwan

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Maybe since the 1990s

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
In fact, Taiwan and the United States

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Their rapid increase

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
This number is actually rapid growth

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
In fact, they are now

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Our so-called new immigrants

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
But for these new immigrants

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
The process of employment in Taiwan

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
At present, there is no relevant research

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So I am actually

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
After I returned to Taiwan

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I also hope

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
If I want to be in this place

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Develop some

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
For this place

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
For local community

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Do some more exploratory research

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Then we can know more about their needs

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
What is it

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So today I still have some limitations

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Of course, in the past, our research

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
He will be limited to

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Maybe we see this finding now

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
It comes from me

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I met this sample

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
May need more in the future

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Still need more research

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Invest in this area

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's just that there are good and bad

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Start from a place

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I hope this kind of research can be provided

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Some new understanding

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Perspective

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Ok

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
In the part of Acknowledgement

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Of course, I am very grateful to the parents who participated

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And my own past

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Instructors and Kouwei

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And this is my second research

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
He actually has two

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Advisory Board Members

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
One is a parent

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
A local NGO in Boston

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
NGO staff

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
He has long been with the local

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Communicative community

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So he also helped me with some cases

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Then provide me a lot of assistance in the process

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Then come again

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
His founding source is from

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Boston University

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We are here

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
The college is called Sargent College

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
They provide a doctoral student

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
A founding

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Thank you very much for your participation today

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
My report is probably here

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
If you have any questions

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
We should be able to

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Enter the discussion stage

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Thank you for the wonderful report

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And speech

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
At this time we will open

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Q&A time

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Then see if there are any participants who want to ask questions

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
You can turn on your microphone at any time

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
To ask questions

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Or you can also write in the chat room

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I can also help you ask questions

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
When everyone is thinking

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I just want to ask you

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
If possible

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
First

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Thank you

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
First of all

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Thank you again for your wonderful speech

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I want to ask

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Actually when we talk about parenting

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
You just started

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Talking about parenting involvement

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
In fact, for me

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I think parenting involvement

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's actually a bright concept

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It's parents

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
How many things to do to the child

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It's actually a number concept

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But within this number

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
There may be different behaviors

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I can imagine

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
In the family of children with special needs

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Parents to children

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
In fact, in addition to

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Specific to their

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Disability

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Some of the problems

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
A special parenting behavior

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
In addition to

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
They may actually have other

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
General parenting style

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Or

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Strategy

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Or their general parenting atmosphere

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I'm also very curious

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
In your two studies

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Especially in your first meta-analysis

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Did you see

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
In these families

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
These immigrants

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
They deal with children

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
The changes in the special parenting behavior

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
What are the differences from ordinary families

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Different changes

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Divided into two levels

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
One is their special plan

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The other is their

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
General parenting behavior

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
This is the first question

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
The second question is

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
In culture

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I just said

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
It's a level problem

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
The second level is when they move

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
When they immigrated to the United States

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Their culture shock

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It may not only reflect

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Western culture

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
They are also in their own past

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
If they are Asian

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Or maybe they are Chinese

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Or Taiwanese

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
They actually brought their own culture

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
In this way

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Under the conflict

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Is it possible that their parenting behavior

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Or their parenting atmosphere will also change

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
This is the second question

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
The third question is

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You can answer it again

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The third question is

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
At the end of the question

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Parent Perceived Role

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It's more like

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Parenting Goal

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Or Socialization Goal

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
How do parents want to

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
How to raise their children

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I'm a little curious about this

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Parents always have some expectations

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Before they have children

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
They have some fixed expectations

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
After they have children

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Their expectations will probably change

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Especially when they

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
When they have children

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Their expectations

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
How to change

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
After the change

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
As time goes by

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
There may be some changes

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I don't know your

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Narrative study

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Can answer this question

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
How do they face this

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
These three questions

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
There is also a very important aspect

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You just mentioned

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Meta-synthesis

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
It's a big

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Global strategy

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You mentioned a compound to expectation

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I feel that

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
In this matter

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Parents and

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Interaction with the environment

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
May also be a very important

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Influence factor

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I asked three questions

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
These are probably the three questions

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Thank you

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Let's start from the last question

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Just mentioned

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Is there any change in the expectation

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
In fact, this matter

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
In my sharing today

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I didn't mention it

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
But because of the change of time

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I want to answer the question

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I can give an example

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
For example, there is a parent

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
His child is

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Autism

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
In his interview

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Keep mentioning

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
At the beginning

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Because

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Autism is

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
You may not find out

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Maybe he is three or five years old

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Or even he is already in high school

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Like a parent

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
He is already in high school

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
It seems to be elementary school or high school

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
His child's anxiety

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Becomes very serious

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So my child

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So-called special child

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He has this

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Asperger's or autism

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
He didn't know when he was born

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
So these two parents

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I think

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Like a brain paralysis

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
This is usually when you are born

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
You may know

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Your child has this situation

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
What will happen to him in the future

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Their doctor

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
May also give them some

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
The so-called aftermath

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
This child is probably like this

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
This kind of

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Give them a

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Reduce their expectations

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I think so

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
They are different obstacles

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Sometimes this kind of slowly

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Only realized

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
This kind of obstacle

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Their parents did mention

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
They were very excited about their children at first

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I hope he can go

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Usually go to school like a child

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Especially if the performance of the school is good

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Gradually discovered

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
My child has this special need

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Or he is very anxious

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
He began to adjust slowly

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Reduce his expectations

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
But later

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It's not even adjusted

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The point is different

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Maybe he started earlier

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
He also put it in

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I hope his academic performance is good

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Then he thought that as immigrants

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
We want to be able to succeed in a new country

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Must rely on education

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So he felt that my child must

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Find a good high school

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
But then he slowly

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Because of these things

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
He slowly adjusted to say okay

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It's okay if you can't go to college today

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
It's okay if you graduate from high school

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's okay if you really graduated from high school

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It's okay if you can't really graduate from high school

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Can you at least finish

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
They have been adjusting

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
In the end

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
He talked about my expectations of my children

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Those looking for a job

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Of course he still hopes that his children

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Can live independently

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But what he cares about

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
He is looking forward to his children

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Can I let my children have a happy life

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Better than his original

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
For this child

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Hope he is a traditional first-time

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Or through education

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Then find a good job for yourself

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
This expectation is indeed

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
In this narrative

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
They often see it in the process of narrative

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Then just

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
The second question is about

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Their culture shock

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Please

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Please

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Sorry

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Just because of this question

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I am also curious

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Maybe their expectation will change

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
In the process of change

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
How did they transform

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
He may have received

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
External resources

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Or maybe his friend

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I think many parents

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
When he is facing this matter

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
His mental change

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I think more or less

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
There may be some stimuli

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Let him help him to do this

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Then he may be emotional

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Will there be some fluctuations

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Sorry to interrupt

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I think the fluctuation is quite common

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Usually the parents are describing

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
In the process of these things

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Even if they have adjusted

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
My expectations of my children

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
They usually describe this

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
The process is quite painful

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
He was originally

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
As the expectation of ordinary parents

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Then slowly

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
He met

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I think most of the time they will adjust expectations

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Often encounter a lot of setbacks

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Then met some of them

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
No matter how hard they try

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Things that can't be changed

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Then this time

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
This emotion and this setback

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
This happened

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Then another one happened

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
They may also interact with the teacher

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Or interact with other families

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The setback may be that they have this high expectation

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Then slowly reduce

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
They will be very anxious

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
They don't know

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
If my child can't do this

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I only know that way

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
If this way can't succeed

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Then my child

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
There is no other place to go

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I can't imagine

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
What should I do

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
But usually this time

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
There will be a slight bounce back

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Is that they see other children

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Other families he knows

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Older children than him

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
They may often mention that I know that

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Their children are a little older than us

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Then his ability is about the same

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
A little better

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
But what did I see them do

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I think they seem to be pretty good

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
So often this time they

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Fall into that valley

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I don't know how to go up

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
The model they see around

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Or need the teacher to provide

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Suggestions or possibilities

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
For them

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Is that they adjust this expectation

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Slowly and more

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
More comfortable

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
A key thing in life

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Probably like this

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Then I go back to the second one now

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
The second question

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Just talked about

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
How to be a parent with the original Asian culture

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Then to a new place

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
There seems to be some impact

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
This thing actually started with me

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Because when I was reading the file

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I did talk about this so-called culture

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Conflicts

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Then I was expecting

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I may see more conflicts in this research

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Originally my native culture

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Tell me how my parents should be better

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
It doesn't seem to be the same here

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So I seem to have some conflicts

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I'm going to find a way

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Reorganize myself

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But the unexpected thing

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
This thing seems to be in my

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
In this sample

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Obviously I asked them

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So for example

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Is there anything you think

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
You want to do what you think you should do

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But after coming here, I found out that everyone seems not like this

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I am just this sample

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I didn't see too many

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
This example is more

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
They feel here

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
In the parents' expectations

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
On the contrary, it is more open

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
He may think

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Of course there is a piece

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Advocacy part

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I didn't have this expectation in the past

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Now come here and find this expectation

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But this expectation

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
In my sample

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It doesn't seem to make them feel very painful

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But also in that part

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Can show you a quote

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
He is

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Other research mentioned

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But he is 2009

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So I don't know if this thing is related to time

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Then this parent he talked about

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
He learned to have advocacy

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But he also said that he felt this thing was very painful

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
For example, he is very worried

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Does it look disrespectful or pushy

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But actually I know

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I need to do this

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Then he also recognized that he knew some American mothers

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
They can say a lot of things very quickly

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Whether it's right or wrong

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
In short, you just say it

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
If you disagree, you have to speak up

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
For him, this mother

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
He is a mother from Japan

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
He thinks this thing is too magical

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I didn't think I would do this

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Then it's not the same as the education I received

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
The background is not the same

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Then we have to do this thing now

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It's difficult for me

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Even though I've been here for so many years

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So like this

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I thought I was in my interview

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Will see a similar conflict

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
But in my five samples

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
It seems to be okay

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
But I think this will be because of my sample

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
To be honest

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
He is actually a

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Their corresponding knowledge level

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Are relatively high

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
They are relatively

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
There are quite a lot of resources

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
For example

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
If you see this

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Their family income and education level

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Except for this second case

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
They seem to be slightly

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It's not that high

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
In fact, other families

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
They have to have the desire

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Come to this two-hour interview

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Three interviews in a row

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Their family resources

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Knowledge level is higher

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So actually I think

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Maybe it's because of this

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I didn't see so many conflicts

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But in this parent

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
On this second parent

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
He described a lot

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
For example, he thinks he doesn't want his children

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
He hopes his children to study hard

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Don't keep going to parties

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
He has different

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Except for his own disabled child

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
This child has a brother

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That brother is an ordinary child

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
He is in the process of telling the story

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
He thinks he doesn't want his children

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
He said his brother

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
That brother may have to take a big test

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I went to the party the day before

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He felt bad

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
He had a little dispute with his son

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
As a result, when he went to school

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
The school teacher told him

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I just like your son

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
I think it's good

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You should not only read

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
You should also play

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Americans play this set

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
You should let them look like this

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Some conflicts

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
It did happen to this mother

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
But I don't know why

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
On the other 1345

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
They will talk about the difference

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
For example, there is a parent

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
He came to America

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Found that American schools emphasize

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Independent living ability

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It's not the same as he imagined

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
They may emphasize

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You have to let your children use the dishwasher

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
You may have to teach your children

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Make sandwiches

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
He may be different

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But he didn't think

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
This is a very difficult conflict for him

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
He felt

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
It turned out to be like this

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Can I learn

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I think it's pretty good

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
He has the ability

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
To face new expectations

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
When he thinks it's good

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
For him

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
The cultural difference

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Did not cause him too much pressure

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I think I will learn

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
This part is true

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
With me in the file

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Or before I entered this research

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Assumption is a bit different

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I think it has something to do with the sample

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Then the first question

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Is about

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Educational behavior

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Educational behavior

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I think this thing is quite interesting

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
He actually has a lot of files

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
The so-called educational behavior

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It may be more focused on him

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Interaction between parents and children

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
But in this research

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
The focus we wanted to do

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Not educational behavior

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
What we want to do is

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Educational resources in the environment

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Or interaction with medical resources

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So this part

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
In my interview

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
There is no great bias

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
To talk about educational behavior

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
But I didn't ask the parents

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
How do you teach your children

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But because we are talking

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Transition to adulthood

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
How to help

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
What are they interacting with their children

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I can think of now

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Several impressive examples

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
For example

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
They learned some

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
They may see Americans

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
More praise children

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So they think this set of their children

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Also quite effective

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
So there may be two or three parents

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I mentioned that I was teaching him

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I will always encourage him

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Then I will know what he is interested in

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
What is stuck

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I will also say quickly

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Or do we want to rest first

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Or I will come back later

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Re-discuss this matter

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So I think they are in this process

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I mentioned some education

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
But this is not my original

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
The focus of the problem

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So it's more about the parents

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I didn't ask comprehensively

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Then I didn't analyze it

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
For this one

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But their education

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I think it's special

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
The way they see it in the United States

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And mainly their children

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
This particularity

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
May make them

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Compared to ordinary parents

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
They have more opportunities to see

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Other teachers

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Or other parents

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
How do they teach

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Children with neurodegenerative disorders

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
They may be more inclined to learn

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
This type of education

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But I didn't ask

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
When you teach this child

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
With another child

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Do you have any

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Big difference

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I don't know if I answered

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
The three questions you wanted to ask

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Thank you

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Thank you very much

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I think I learned a lot

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
My question is like this

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I just saw

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Pei Chen

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
There is a question

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Do you want to see the microphone yourself

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Okay

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Hello

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Hello

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Thank you

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Thank you

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Thank you

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
It seems like

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
The sound is a bit cut off

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Is it a signal

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Gao Shen, can you hear it clearly? Or is it just me?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I don't seem to hear it

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Can you hear it like this?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yes, I can

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Much better

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Sorry

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Thank you for your presentation

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I learned a lot

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Then I am

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Zhen Pei Chen

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I just graduated

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I have a curious question

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Is

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
You observed these parents in the United States

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I am quite curious

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
These parents

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Will they all focus on the same

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Parental Support Group

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Or

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Are they scattered in different

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Parental Support Group

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Because your analysis also mentioned

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
They think they can change

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Some of the community level

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
They can have some influence

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Or creativity

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Want to change some community level things

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Then I am quite curious

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Are they a group of people to change together

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Or more

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
One person has to face

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The whole community

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
People like this

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I just want to know

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Your observation

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Because I found these parents

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
They don't know each other

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Then they all live in the Greater Boston area

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But they didn't participate in

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
What Support Group

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Although they all mentioned

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
The existence of this Support Group

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But also for Asian

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Or for families who speak Chinese

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
As far as I know

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
There are not many in Boston

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It may be one or two years

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
These parents

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Sometimes they go to school

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
He may participate

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
He may go to this school

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
This school originally their parents

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
There are some organizations like parent meetings

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Then they have this opportunity to participate

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Group with other parents

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But not necessarily a Support Group

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Maybe just everyone discuss together

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
This so-called IEP

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Or the school

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Children's rights

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
He will observe through these ways

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Other non-Asian immigrants

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Parents

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
How do they interact with this community

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
One of the parents

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
He mentioned that he also wanted to do this

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Support Group

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
He found this very interesting

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Then he just had a person

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
He felt that OK

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
In fact, this is great

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Then we Asians seem to be relatively small

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Then I will do it myself

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
He felt good

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Then I have to rely on myself

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
The quote he used

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
He said he wanted to influence his community

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
That's a dad

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Just his own job

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
He is in an NGO

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
But his object is the elderly

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Then he lives in that area

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
More

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Is a Chinese immigrant

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Then their position

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Relatively

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Not so rich

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Resource area

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
His original job

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
This Asian community is very close

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Then he just felt

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
This Asian community was originally doing service

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But he felt that he could just

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Through his connection with this community

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Let everyone in his community know

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
He has a disabled child

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Then he also encouraged others because of this

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
There are parents in this community who are also disabled

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Willing to take the child out

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Strictly speaking

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I don't think they have yet

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
How many people do we need to gather together

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Do this thing together

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I have the ability and resources now

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I still have time to invest

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Then I am around me

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
To influence the people I know around me

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
At this level

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
As far as I know

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I just met another one recently

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
He is a social worker

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Then he is in Boston

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
They are really providing

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
To parents who speak Chinese

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
They have support groups

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Then there are parents who speak Portuguese and Spanish

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
But I still don't know about them

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Because of the situation

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I met the epidemic

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Because of the epidemic

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
No face-to-face contact

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
If they are this kind of organization

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
They are more organized

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Provide this kind of service

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They are not parents

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
They are more

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
He is a NGO doing similar things

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Thank you

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
No

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Thank you

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Then we ask the audience on site

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Any other questions

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
If everyone has no other questions

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Or maybe later

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
We can discuss again

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Or maybe in private

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Contact the epidemic

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
If you feel

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
If it's convenient

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
We can do a final sum up

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Do you have anything

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I want to share

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Take home message

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I think the main first thing

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I think

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Why do you want to do this research

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I think this group of people

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Their voice is less heard

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
May be limited to

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Language

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
The past research is still more mainstream

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Even in white families

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
People with high social status

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Experience

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
I hope through this kind of research

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Can let everyone see this kind of research

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Less presented

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So this is what I do

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
This kind of research

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
The motivation

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
This kind of research

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
It should be more and more

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Not just in certain groups

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I hope it's in all kinds of

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
People with cultural backgrounds

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Should have this kind of research

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
To understand their experience

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
The second thing I want to talk about

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Maybe as

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Professionals or clinical staff

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Sometimes our perspective

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Will be more limited

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
The interaction between me and this person

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
But I hope through this kind of research

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
What I want to bring to everyone

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
When you face this person

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Or his past

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
The present and future

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Actually affect

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Why is he here now

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
With what he is doing now

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
But we usually may

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
No more than this

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Or did not have the opportunity to understand his past

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
You may be right

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
What he is doing now

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Can't understand

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
If he is different from what you think

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
There may be some conflicts

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But I hope through this kind of research

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
For everyone to see

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
We face this individual

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Then

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Next

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I think I mainly want to tell you

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
These two things

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I also hope in the future

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Can do some in Taiwan

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Apply this type of research

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But I don't think this

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
This kind of research discovery

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
It can be directly in another country

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
After all, the conditions of each country

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Or historical background

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Are very different

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I think this kind of thing

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
If you want to be in different places

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
To do it

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It actually takes some time

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Do the local community

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
You may have a deeper understanding

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
You know how to target

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
You want to provide services

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Provide the most effective thing for them

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
So probably

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
If today's take-home

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I hope these three points

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Thank you Yiting

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Thank you for your wonderful speech today

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And the take-home message just now

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I think for many of our audience

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
It should be very helpful

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Okay, our speech today

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Officially ends here

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So I will stop recording now
