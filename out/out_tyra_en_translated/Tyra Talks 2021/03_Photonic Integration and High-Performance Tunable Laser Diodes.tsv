0	10000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Taira Talk on March 20th.
10000	20000	Today's speaker is Dr. Su Guanlin.
20000	30000	He was a doctorate student at UIUC, and then a post-doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley.
30000	40000	Today, he is going to talk about the direction of his research, which is collective light path, continuous light study, integrated process, and wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.
40000	50000	The topic he is going to talk about today is his work at UC Berkeley.
50000	60000	I think it has a lot to do with semiconductor laser and its integration.
60000	70000	Let's give him a round of applause.
70000	76000	Let's start with Dr. Guanlin.
76000	80000	Thank you, Jason. Thank you, everyone, for coming to my talk.
80000	86000	I want to thank Taira for providing this platform so that we can talk about this topic today.
86000	93000	My topic today is high-performance and high-performance wavelength-adjustable semiconductor laser.
93000	99000	As Jason just mentioned, this is something I studied at UC Berkeley as a post-doctoral researcher.
99000	105000	The unit I am currently affiliated with is Intel Labs Research Scientist.
105000	110000	Why do I want to mention this field in particular?
110000	113000	In fact, you may not be familiar with this picture.
113000	117000	This is a Wi-Fi input test web page.
117000	124000	The Wi-Fi on the screen that I will connect to you today is actually built up by light integration technology.
124000	127000	This is called optical transceiver.
127000	132000	This green row is all optical transceiver.
132000	136000	It's all equipped with light integration technology components.
137000	143000	This is also the most competitive field in light integration technology.
143000	147000	Even though it's very competitive, it's just the beginning.
147000	152000	Light integration technology has actually developed a lot of opportunities.
152000	161000	I personally think this technology is a very balanced combination of laser physics, light, and semiconductor manufacturing.
162000	166000	I think it's quite aesthetic.
166000	169000	So I hope to invest a lot.
169000	176000	As Jason just said, if we can make good use of Terra Journal Club,
176000	183000	I believe we can find a lot of people in this field who have the same morality and then further promote it.
187000	190000	My talk today is mainly divided into three parts.
190000	192000	The first part is the introduction.
192000	196000	I will introduce to you what is light integration technology.
196000	200000	And some of its basics.
200000	202000	Then there are two examples.
202000	204000	I have done two examples in Berkeley.
204000	207000	It's probably a very wide, widely tunable.
207000	211000	It can be tuned to a few nanometers.
211000	215000	And the second one is a system-level work.
215000	217000	It's a laser power guiding system.
217000	221000	It's kind of like we want to demo a data center.
221000	226000	A very energy-saving network resource distribution system.
226000	228000	This is also done by using light integration.
228000	230000	The rest is my summary.
230000	235000	I'm sorry to give you a disclaimer.
235000	239000	Because I am now working on light integration technology.
239000	242000	One of the benefits is Intel.
242000	248000	My opinion today, my discovery, and my summary.
248000	251000	In fact, it does not represent the company's position.
251000	255000	You can think of me as a postdoc.
258000	260000	What is light integration technology?
260000	264000	In fact, we all know that there is nothing too fresh under the sun.
264000	269000	Light integration technology allows light resources to go back to the microwave resources.
269000	273000	We are going to go from the table to the source.
273000	275000	We are going to go from the table to the source today.
275000	278000	This is what light integration technology represents.
278000	282000	The essence of technology is like this.
282000	290000	This technology was proposed by Stuart Miller in 1969.
290000	294000	This article was a very important article.
294000	296000	He mentioned three very important points.
296000	301000	The first is how we get the light from the optical table to the chip.
301000	306000	We have to create a certain optical distortion rate on this chip.
306000	311000	It can also form a web-guided structure.
311000	315000	After this thing is realized, he said.
315000	319000	After this thing is realized, we can improve the stability of the whole system.
319000	321000	Its reliability will increase.
321000	324000	Unlike doing free space, we often need to adjust some components.
325000	329000	When everything is on the same chip, this thing can be omitted.
329000	331000	You can ignore this step.
331000	335000	After this step is completed, he made the boldest prediction.
335000	338000	He thinks this thing will have a certain market scale.
338000	347000	Today, 50 years later, we can see that the light receiver is a very novel market.
347000	350000	This is basically in line with his prediction.
350000	358000	What he didn't predict is that humans have broken through the synthesis process of a single chip.
358000	361000	We can now synthesize more materials on a single chip.
361000	364000	Or we can synthesize two chips of different materials together.
364000	368000	It can break the physical limit set by a single material.
368000	371000	This is our hybridization material.
371000	375000	At the same time, if you combine a lot of materials of different optical properties,
375000	379000	you can break the physical limit set by a single material.
379000	386000	This thing is also a powerful force that promotes the advancement of the industrial world and the academic world.
386000	392000	This is basically the most intense field at present.
392000	398000	The left side is the traditional light communication, sensing, and network systems.
398000	402000	For example, last year, two terabits per second were demonstrated.
402000	411000	It's not just a light receiver, it's also a PGA.
411000	414000	This is a very, very new result.
414000	417000	This was in March of last year.
417000	420000	Then, about ten years ago,
420000	424000	Onchip, which was made on a single-chip,
424000	427000	is the optical prime of a chip.
427000	429000	It has a bandwidth of 300 MHz.
429000	434000	This is the last year's 30 parallel channels light radar.
434000	442000	This is the most studied technology in LiDAR.
442000	446000	It's a 30-channel light radar.
446000	449000	This is a very large amount of transmission.
449000	456000	In Japan, AIST also showed 800 Gbps data transmission.
456000	458000	And it's a light-operated data transmission.
458000	460000	And it's Lossless.
460000	464000	Basically, it doesn't matter how much power goes in, how much power comes out.
464000	466000	No loss.
466000	468000	In the more cutting-edge field,
468000	473000	For example, machine learning, quantum, and NIST,
473000	475000	The American Academy of Science and Technology,
475000	480000	In 2018, they demonstrated a optical frequency transmitter.
480000	486000	Directly in C-band, the so-called 1550nm,
486000	489000	1.93kHz,
489000	492000	It directly generates an optical frequency.
492000	494000	And its frequency can be up to 1Hz.
494000	499000	That is to say, its error is only 10-14 to 10-15.
499000	503000	This is a very fine frequency generator.
503000	508000	A Spanish group also made an optical FPGA last year.
509000	513000	It is composed of multiple unit cells.
513000	515000	It can do all kinds of transfer functions.
515000	520000	If you want to program it, you can program it.
520000	522000	A few years ago, it also came out.
522000	526000	Use optical circuits to make convolutional neural networks.
526000	528000	It can do image vision.
528000	530000	Connecting these two most extreme fields,
530000	535000	In fact, what can't be separated from the industrial and academic fields is our so-called high-performance light source.
535000	537000	Based on optical integration technology,
537000	543000	The bandwidth of our current bioluminescence laser has been compressed to about 3Hz.
543000	546000	Turnability has also exceeded 100nm.
546000	548000	This is C-band, so it is about 1550nm.
548000	552000	So it can be adjusted from 14 to 1600nm.
552000	555000	And our optical amplifiers on the chip
555000	559000	It has now exceeded 27dB, which is 500 times the optical amplification.
559000	561000	It can bear 500 times the loss on the chip.
561000	564000	It can continue to recover your signal.
564000	566000	Then there is a frequency cone.
566000	569000	It can produce direct 4-cell.
569000	574000	So this is a very groundbreaking work.
574000	578000	In fact, these more amazing studies,
578000	584000	In fact, the following things are very basic, very fundamental things.
584000	585000	It's our so-called waveguiding.
585000	587000	What Miller mentioned just now,
587000	590000	What is the difference in the loss rate caused by a single chip?
590000	593000	The one on the left is a SEM, a optical chip.
593000	595000	The SEM of the light path inside
595000	600000	The light is transmitted in these so-called light path lines.
600000	605000	When we cut this straight waveguide,
605000	607000	In the cross-sectional area,
607000	609000	We see such a material distribution.
609000	611000	For example, in this paper,
611000	614000	The material of the light path is a single-chip.
615000	618000	Below it is a low-resolution,
618000	621000	That is, the two-chip is the material below it.
621000	623000	It's all air.
623000	625000	So if you cut a chip,
625000	626000	You can see its index.
626000	629000	Its resolution distribution is actually a step thing.
629000	632000	Under these boundary conditions,
632000	636000	Our Maxwell's equation will actually degenerate into an eigenvalue problem.
636000	638000	Its solution is Lissan.
638000	640000	Then this solution is our so-called waveguiding mode.
640000	642000	Its solution basically looks like this.
642000	645000	That's different from the plane wave.
645000	646000	Waveguiding mode,
646000	650000	It is defined by an equivalent resolution.
650000	655000	Its equivalent resolution is somewhere between the low-resolution and the high-resolution.
655000	659000	Then its field shape is basically a certain rule.
659000	662000	Its peak value is a semi-wavelength.
662000	664000	Can fit in this index.
664000	667000	Then its peak value is probably in the middle.
667000	671000	Then we can change this light path.
671000	672000	Our so-called waveguiding.
672000	674000	Its light path, its interface,
674000	676000	We can engineer its mode.
676000	678000	For example, we can have this.
678000	679000	A little wider,
679000	681000	We can now fit in three modes.
681000	684000	For example, there are several more than just now.
684000	687000	So we just need to be able to master this light path.
687000	689000	Its basic design,
689000	690000	For example, its material,
690000	692000	Its index gap,
692000	693000	The gap between light and snow,
693000	694000	The gap between light and snow,
694000	695000	And its size.
695000	698000	We can design different photonic devices,
698000	700000	Photonic components.
700000	702000	In this talk,
702000	705000	I want to introduce a few photonic components.
705000	707000	First of all, this is what I just said.
707000	709000	If we use a single mode,
709000	713000	A single light path that can only support one mode.
713000	716000	We trigger a light path that can support multiple modes.
716000	718000	This light path is relatively fat.
718000	722000	Then I can trigger many waveguiding modes at the same time.
722000	724000	Then they will interfere.
724000	728000	This interference pattern can be accurately predicted.
728000	732000	For example, this is a very standard light path.
732000	737000	If we cut off this relatively thick wave at the right length,
737000	739000	We can make a light path.
739000	741000	This is a light path.
741000	743000	This is a light path.
743000	745000	This is a light path.
745000	746000	Then,
746000	748000	Then,
748000	750000	This is a light path.
750000	751000	This is a light path.
751000	753000	Then we are a 1x3 light path.
753000	755000	Then we have a single mode,
755000	757000	We set up two mirrors.
757000	759000	Partially mirrored, or 100%.
759000	761000	It can form a cavity.
761000	763000	This is a cavity.
763000	766000	If we add some photonic components to this cavity,
766000	768000	That is to say, it provides gain.
768000	772000	Then you can compensate for the loss of the entire cavity.
772000	773000	Under the right conditions,
773000	775000	It will form our so-called photoreceptor.
775000	777000	This is our laser.
777000	779000	What about this curve?
779000	780000	One by one,
780000	782000	It actually reflects that
782000	784000	All that can be seen in this photoreceptor
784000	787000	It forms a whole number of waves.
787000	788000	The wave field.
788000	790000	This is our so-called magnet.
790000	791000	Longitudinal mode.
791000	792000	This is the magnet.
792000	793000	It mainly emits light.
793000	795000	These wave fields.
795000	797000	Of course, we can also put a single-core
797000	799000	Single-core single-mode waveguide.
799000	803000	We use a more complicated loop to make it into a filter.
803000	807000	The first filter is our so-called Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
807000	808000	In addition,
808000	810000	You can also make it into a circular photoreceptor.
810000	811000	That is to say, the light hit in here.
811000	814000	The light coming out of here can also have a filter effect.
814000	816000	Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
816000	819000	Its transfer function is a very classic sine wave.
819000	820000	It is a sine wave.
820000	821000	From 0% to 8%.
821000	823000	That environment.
823000	826000	Its transfer function is a sharp thing.
826000	828000	Because it needs to achieve a resonance in the middle.
828000	832000	So its frequency selection is very large.
832000	833000	It is very fine.
833000	836000	But at the same time, it is also difficult to reach 100%.
837000	843000	In these devices that are used to form resonance in the future.
843000	845000	Whether it's a cavity or a filter.
845000	849000	The distance between our resonance points.
849000	853000	Basically, it depends on the size of our feature layer.
853000	855000	For example, in this cavity.
855000	856000	Laser cavity.
856000	857000	The distance between these grids.
857000	860000	It's actually very different from the resonance field.
860000	863000	And in Mach-Zehnder's interferometer.
863000	864000	In the middle of these resonance points.
864000	866000	It's the length that comes out of this.
866000	867000	It's also inverted.
867000	868000	In the same way.
868000	870000	The distance between these two resonance points.
870000	873000	And the radius of this transverse resonator.
873000	875000	That is to say, its wavelength is inverted.
875000	878000	These devices with resonance features.
878000	879000	Of course, after we do it.
879000	880000	After we realize it.
880000	883000	It must be different from what we expected at the time.
883000	885000	Because there will be various errors in the process.
885000	887000	So we may have to add some.
887000	890000	Our so-called phase tuner.
890000	891000	We can use.
891000	893000	Substantially change this.
893000	896000	The detection coefficient on a certain waveguide.
896000	897000	For example, heating.
897000	898000	Substantial heating.
898000	899000	Or adding a power plant.
899000	900000	Or adding current.
900000	901000	Turn off the current.
901000	904000	To stimulate these electron hole pairs.
904000	906000	We can change its optical detection rate.
906000	907000	And then we can.
907000	908000	Put these.
908000	910000	We used to miss the resonance points.
910000	913000	Move it to where we want it to be.
913000	914000	So basically.
914000	916000	As long as you are familiar with these components.
916000	918000	You can build a more complex system.
918000	919000	If you have any ideas.
919000	922000	You can use some well-known components to build it.
922000	925000	I'm going to talk about it now.
925000	927000	The first example I want to introduce to you.
927000	928000	Is this.
928000	930000	Ah.
930000	933000	We are on the single-conductive material.
933000	935000	There is also a single-conductive.
935000	936000	Integrated platform.
936000	937000	They made it.
937000	938000	The platform.
938000	940000	I will do a demonstration with him later.
940000	944000	That.
944000	950000	Ah.
950000	955000	Is.
955000	961000	In fact.
961000	962000	It's a single-conductive material.
962000	965000	It's not a multi-conductive material.
965000	975000	This one.
975000	977000	You decide.
977000	981000	The idea is that the two juices are theoretically exactly the same.
981000	985000	And when they launch, they will have a very uniform shape.
985000	986000	It's just optical.
986000	991000	It's just the shape of the frequency of this optical controversy.
991000	992000	Ah.
992000	993000	So you see every line.
993000	997000	They actually don't have a lot of energy.
997000	1000000	But if we listen to the laser, we are in this.
1000000	1001000	This one.
1001000	1004000	Every product is inserted into a optical filter.
1004000	1005000	Ah.
1005000	1008000	This optical filter can be controlled by external signals.
1008000	1009000	For example.
1009000	1010000	Ah.
1010000	1011000	This is our so-called light barrier.
1011000	1013000	Then he can.
1013000	1016000	He can only choose one laser model.
1016000	1018000	He suppresses other laser models.
1018000	1023000	So when he has a shock radiation, he is a single-mole laser.
1023000	1025000	And he has a very strong one.
1025000	1026000	Ah.
1026000	1027000	This is a well-defined mode.
1027000	1030000	Only his power is obviously a lot bigger than that.
1030000	1033000	So what kind of applications does he have?
1033000	1034000	He's the first one.
1034000	1035000	It can be used in gas.
1035000	1036000	Ah.
1036000	1037000	Ah.
1037000	1038000	My class.
1038000	1039000	It's optical.
1039000	1040000	Optical.
1040000	1041000	It can be used to track a certain party.
1041000	1042000	Or in the sound optical field.
1042000	1043000	He can do it.
1043000	1044000	The part of the body.
1044000	1047000	Then his light transmission is also a more traditional application.
1047000	1048000	Ah.
1048000	1049000	For example.
1049000	1050000	Hong Kong communication.
1050000	1051000	Or the same tone communication.
1051000	1052000	It's all a main force.
1052000	1053000	That's a new one.
1053000	1054000	Hong Kong is introducing to you.
1054000	1056000	The frequency-continuous wave light radar.
1056000	1057000	This.
1057000	1058000	He still has.
1058000	1059000	The main force is.
1059000	1060000	He is.
1060000	1061000	The main light source of the frequency-continuous wave.
1061000	1062000	That.
1062000	1063000	And.
1063000	1064000	Color.
1064000	1065000	Military Wave.
1065000	1066000	The frequency generation.
1066000	1069000	It's also called Tunable Laser.
1069000	1070000	That.
1070000	1071000	Tunable Laser.
1071000	1072000	What is his main metric?
1072000	1074000	What are his main parameters?
1074000	1075000	For example.
1075000	1076000	The most classic one.
1076000	1077000	I just introduced to you.
1077000	1078000	It's a.
1078000	1079000	Ah.
1079000	1080000	One.
1080000	1083000	The back side is replaced by a light bomb.
1083000	1084000	That light bomb.
1084000	1085000	After you put the current in it.
1085000	1087000	His index will change.
1087000	1088000	That is, the light bomb.
1088000	1089000	His.
1089000	1090000	His.
1090000	1091000	The black weapon in the middle.
1091000	1092000	His.
1092000	1093000	His maximum reflectivity.
1093000	1094000	The wave field can be.
1094000	1095000	Because.
1095000	1096000	Add current.
1096000	1097000	And then control.
1097000	1098000	That he.
1098000	1099000	That laser.
1099000	1100000	After the shock radiation.
1100000	1101000	His laser spectrum.
1101000	1103000	It basically looks like this.
1103000	1104000	Ah.
1104000	1105000	Until that one.
1105000	1106000	He's a single mass.
1106000	1107000	My.
1107000	1108000	His laser.
1108000	1109000	Why doesn't look like this?
1109000	1112000	Top wind with this second wind.
1112000	1113000	Power in the middle.
1113000	1118020	The difference is a 40 bibi, which is our so-called Punk wants.
1118020	1119000	He's al.
1119000	1120000	The mainstream wind and the wind.
1120000	1122000	The igen they stand between each other.
1122000	1123000	10 to 10.
1123000	1126000	It's in the BB.
1126000	1127000	For the second.
1127000	1128000	The second.
1128000	1129000	Who the hell is the parameter?
1129000	1130000	What is the original parameter?
1130000	1131000	I'm going to say.
1131000	1132000	So much.
1132000	1133000	When he continues.
1133000	1135000	In the case of continuous power supply.
1135000	1136000	He can.
1136000	1137000	He can.
1137000	1139000	He has a total of his weapons that can be adjusted.
1139000	1141000	How much?
1141000	1144000	Of course, his output power is also a main measurement goal.
1144000	1147000	Milliwatt or dbm to show.
1147000	1148000	And his efficiency.
1148000	1149000	For example, his.
1149000	1151000	How much power do you put in?
1151000	1154000	How much power does it give you?
1154000	1155000	Such a conversion efficiency.
1155000	1156000	It's a line with.
1156000	1158000	This is our frequency.
1158000	1159000	Accuracy.
1159000	1161000	Then it's because of the client.
1161000	1162000	A little better.
1162000	1168000	If it's a little worse, it's basically this number.
1168000	1170000	What if it's like this example?
1170000	1171000	This traditional dbm laser.
1171000	1173000	He only has one.
1173000	1174000	Ah.
1174000	1176000	In the case of a filter.
1176000	1178000	The most we do is adjust 5 to 6 nanometers.
1178000	1181000	This is a material limit.
1181000	1183000	So how do we get tens of nanometers?
1183000	1185000	Or like the example I just did.
1185000	1187000	More than 100 nanometers of tuning.
1187000	1189000	We mainly have two means.
1189000	1191000	This can be achieved.
1191000	1193000	This is the so-called white ability.
1193000	1195000	The first one is to use.
1195000	1197000	Ah, but it's a pair.
1197000	1199000	That is to say, we are using a pair.
1199000	1200000	This is the structure.
1200000	1203000	For example, the circular oscillator or the light.
1203000	1204000	Ah, light.
1204000	1205000	This kind of explosion.
1205000	1207000	As long as you are a pair, you can do this.
1207000	1208000	What does that mean?
1208000	1211000	This example is that we have two circular oscillators.
1211000	1212000	His.
1212000	1213000	The environment is different.
1213000	1214000	What about when the environment is different?
1214000	1215000	He's this.
1215000	1216000	Between the two points of resonance.
1216000	1218000	We have the so-called Fritz.
1218000	1219000	Fsr.
1219000	1220000	It's different.
1220000	1221000	For example, the green ring.
1221000	1222000	He.
1222000	1224000	We can see the green ring and the orange ring.
1224000	1225000	It's a little different.
1225000	1227000	So it leads to the two of them.
1227000	1228000	When they are together.
1228000	1229000	Only in their ally.
1229000	1230000	This place.
1230000	1231000	130 nanometers.
1231000	1233000	His transmission is the highest.
1233000	1235000	Then when you.
1235000	1236000	Ah.
1236000	1237000	In the middle of this green ring.
1237000	1238000	Add an object.
1238000	1239000	After a three-dimensional movement.
1239000	1242000	He can move a little bit.
1242000	1243000	Just move a little bit.
1243000	1244000	But their.
1244000	1248000	The second overlapping place is directly from 130 to 1290 nanometers.
1248000	1249000	So he's just.
1249000	1251000	You just have to move about 1 to 2 nanometers.
1251000	1253000	The wind.
1253000	1254000	What about your overall score?
1254000	1256000	You can jump ten times.
1256000	1258000	This is what we call the so-called oil marker effect.
1258000	1260000	I've used oil markers.
1260000	1261000	They all know that there are two degrees above.
1261000	1263000	They are a little bit away.
1263000	1264000	This is what they are.
1264000	1265000	You move one of them a little bit.
1265000	1267000	The next time they come.
1267000	1269000	It's very far away.
1269000	1270000	Then this.
1270000	1271000	His.
1271000	1272000	Ah.
1272000	1273000	His second feature.
1273000	1274000	It's just that he's got a very small.
1274000	1275000	This.
1275000	1276000	This.
1276000	1277000	Ah.
1277000	1278000	He can make a big one for you.
1278000	1280000	Frequency jump.
1280000	1282000	Another feature.
1282000	1285000	It's usually this kind of parallel structure.
1285000	1287000	His role is relatively sharp.
1287000	1289000	In other words, his filter works very well.
1289000	1291000	But he's another semi-permanent.
1291000	1294000	One of the more significant shortcomings is that he's more.
1294000	1295000	Because.
1295000	1296000	He is a result.
1296000	1297000	So he.
1297000	1299000	Two small things into one.
1299000	1300000	He's getting smaller and smaller.
1300000	1301000	When you connect more and more.
1301000	1302000	He's getting bigger and bigger.
1302000	1304000	For example, you can see him.
1304000	1309000	From 80% to 64%.
1309000	1310000	That's another way.
1310000	1311000	Just use light interference.
1311000	1313000	That's what we just said.
1313000	1315000	A single color.
1315000	1316000	That's under this architecture.
1316000	1318000	We're just going to cut the structure in half.
1318000	1320000	And then add the mirror directly.
1320000	1321000	We all know this.
1321000	1322000	This mirror image.
1322000	1326000	It can be used as a single color.
1326000	1327000	His.
1327000	1328000	His transfer function.
1328000	1330000	That's the classic.
1331000	1334000	Then as long as one of the.
1338000	1340000	100% reflection.
1340000	1341000	That.
1345000	1347000	He's a continuous tuning.
1347000	1348000	That's what he.
1348000	1350000	It's the type of thing that jumps.
1350000	1351000	He is.
1351000	1352000	He's moving as much as you add.
1352000	1353000	How much.
1354000	1355000	But it should.
1358000	1359000	He's not like this.
1359000	1360000	He's not like this.
1360000	1362000	The more you wear, the more he loses.
1362000	1364000	Uh, but his shortcomings.
1364000	1367000	It's also obvious that his role is slower.
1367000	1369000	It's just that he's particularly close to this.
1369000	1370000	The top of the three-way.
1370000	1371000	So his.
1371000	1372000	Uh.
1372000	1373000	Frequency selection.
1373000	1376000	It's not as good as this one.
1376000	1377000	I don't know if it's so good.
1377000	1378000	Whether it's an effect.
1379000	1381000	That's the kind of resonance.
1381000	1383000	Whether it's a resonance or this interference.
1383000	1384000	This kind of component.
1384000	1385000	He.
1385000	1386000	We've seen it.
1386000	1388000	He can be used.
1388000	1389000	Uh.
1389000	1390000	It can be adjusted.
1390000	1391000	It's a price.
1391000	1392000	For example.
1392000	1393000	On the single-fingered.
1393000	1394000	He is.
1394000	1396000	It's already reached a commodity level.
1396000	1397000	A parameter.
1397000	1398000	It can be adjusted.
1398000	1399000	For example.
1399000	1400000	There's a front light.
1400000	1401000	Backlight.
1401000	1402000	There's a layer of light in the middle.
1402000	1404000	There's an external magnifier on the outside.
1404000	1405000	At the same time.
1405000	1406000	To magnify.
1406000	1407000	Uh.
1407000	1408000	It's used to magnify light.
1408000	1409000	His.
1409000	1410000	Range.
1410000	1411000	It can be adjusted.
1411000	1412000	About 40 nanometers.
1412000	1413000	His.
1413000	1414000	It's the wind.
1414000	1415000	If you press the wind.
1415000	1416000	About 50 db.
1416000	1418000	It's 100,000 times the pressure.
1418000	1419000	Uh.
1419000	1420000	It's already at 100.
1420000	1422000	But in the case of an external magnifier.
1422000	1424000	It can be up to 40.
1424000	1425000	Uh.
1425000	1426000	Uh.
1426000	1427000	This is a commodity scale.
1427000	1428000	A parameter.
1428000	1429000	That.
1429000	1430000	Next is.
1430000	1431000	On the second.
1431000	1433000	The platform will be introduced to you later.
1433000	1434000	On the silicon.
1434000	1435000	We.
1435000	1436000	Already.
1436000	1438000	Humans have made countless nanometers.
1438000	1439000	More than 50.
1439000	1440000	Uh.
1440000	1441000	db.
1441000	1442000	SMSR.
1442000	1443000	And then.
1443000	1444000	It's less than 100.
1444000	1445000	Because he doesn't have an external magnifier.
1445000	1446000	In fact, he.
1446000	1447000	Uh.
1447000	1448000	Nine.
1448000	1449000	It's still relative.
1449000	1450000	A more.
1450000	1451000	Uh.
1451000	1452000	A power level.
1452000	1453000	That.
1453000	1454000	In this.
1454000	1455000	Light.
1455000	1456000	Light interference.
1456000	1457000	The method.
1457000	1458000	In.
1458000	1459000	Most of the time.
1459000	1460000	It's in the single-finger.
1460000	1461000	They make monolithic.
1461000	1462000	A little.
1462000	1463000	That's it.
1463000	1464000	It's three.
1464000	1465000	Really.
1465000	1466000	Stuck together.
1466000	1467000	That.
1467000	1468000	It can be up to 74 nanometers.
1468000	1469000	You.
1469000	1470000	Uh.
1470000	1471000	At the same time.
1471000	1472000	About 40 db.
1472000	1473000	Or more.
1473000	1474000	A little bit.
1474000	1475000	Uh.
1475000	1476000	Power is relatively low.
1476000	1477000	He only has one.
1477000	1478000	That's it.
1478000	1479000	This example.
1479000	1480000	He's this year.
1480000	1481000	He just came out last year.
1481000	1482000	He's eight.
1482000	1483000	Uh.
1483000	1484000	More.
1484000	1485000	More extreme.
1485000	1486000	A means.
1486000	1487000	He has eight.
1487000	1488000	Mzi.
1488000	1489000	8.
1489000	1490000	The interference.
1490000	1491000	He's a total of 45 nanometers.
1491000	1492000	Uh.
1492000	1493000	50 db.
1493000	1494000	SMSR.
1494000	1495000	His language.
1495000	1496000	It's also down to 160.
1496000	1497000	Uh.
1497000	1498000	Power is also better than the previous one.
1498000	1499000	50.
1499000	1500000	Uh.
1500000	1501000	About five.
1501000	1502000	But.
1502000	1503000	You can see that they are involved.
1503000	1505000	They use a lot of filters.
1505000	1506000	Compared to this.
1506000	1507000	This kind of use.
1507000	1508000	Uh.
1508000	1510000	They need more filters.
1510000	1512000	To reach this level.
1512000	1514000	40 or 50 db.
1514000	1517000	So we can see it very intuitively.
1517000	1519000	His control is how you want to go.
1519000	1522000	It's actually quite a challenge.
1522000	1524000	What about this filter design?
1524000	1527000	In this example, you can see this.
1527000	1528000	Light filter.
1528000	1529000	His design.
1529000	1531000	It directly affects your laser performance.
1531000	1533000	This is very obvious.
1533000	1535000	Then in 2011.
1535000	1536000	Ah.
1536000	1537000	Please say.
1537000	1538000	Oh.
1538000	1539000	This is the language here.
1539000	1542000	What is the laser language?
1542000	1544000	Uh.
1544000	1545000	What do you mean?
1545000	1546000	Uh.
1546000	1547000	That is.
1547000	1548000	That is.
1548000	1550000	These languages are.
1550000	1551000	Uh.
1551000	1552000	He is.
1552000	1553000	Oh.
1553000	1555000	Intrinsic language.
1555000	1557000	Is it related to his laser.
1557000	1558000	Is it related to the gun?
1558000	1559000	Or with.
1559000	1560000	Oh.
1560000	1561000	Right.
1561000	1562000	He is.
1562000	1563000	He is.
1563000	1564000	Intrinsic.
1564000	1565000	That's right.
1565000	1566000	You remember very well.
1566000	1567000	He is.
1567000	1568000	It's related to the gun.
1568000	1569000	Uh.
1569000	1570000	If.
1570000	1571000	For.
1571000	1572000	Uh.
1572000	1573000	Laser.
1573000	1574000	He is more.
1574000	1575000	Just.
1575000	1576000	I have prepared a more.
1576000	1577000	Uh.
1577000	1578000	A more graphic slide.
1578000	1579000	What is his language?
1579000	1580000	He's actually laser.
1580000	1581000	His.
1581000	1582000	He's tired to death.
1582000	1583000	When he turned his body around.
1583000	1584000	He's actually.
1584000	1585000	Especially the semiconductor laser.
1585000	1586000	He's in his background.
1586000	1588000	In fact, there is a very weak.
1588000	1589000	It's his.
1589000	1590000	Uh.
1590000	1591000	Self-radiation.
1591000	1593000	It's just that he hasn't reached the water.
1593000	1594000	The thing that happened before.
1594000	1595000	It's the LED thing.
1595000	1596000	Uh.
1596000	1597000	When it reaches the water.
1597000	1599000	He's going to have a very clear one.
1599000	1600000	Uh.
1600000	1602000	The mechanism of radio radiation.
1602000	1603000	But.
1603000	1605000	And then this is my.
1605000	1606000	Put this.
1606000	1607000	The expression of that.
1607000	1608000	It's his.
1608000	1609000	Instantaneous.
1609000	1610000	The electric field inside the laser.
1610000	1611000	His face.
1611000	1613000	When the radiation occurs.
1613000	1615000	There will be a very large amount.
1615000	1617000	To show that he was the radiation field.
1617000	1619000	But on top of this.
1619000	1621000	It's because he's got a lot of background.
1621000	1622000	Uh.
1622000	1623000	Self-radiation.
1623000	1624000	So he's got this.
1624000	1625000	He has a very weak one.
1625000	1626000	A very small amount.
1626000	1627000	He has.
1627000	1628000	He.
1628000	1629000	It's riding on this.
1629000	1630000	This.
1630000	1631000	On top of the mobile radiation.
1631000	1633000	His lungs are random.
1633000	1634000	It should be said that he is.
1634000	1636000	So you can imagine.
1636000	1637000	He's a very big amount.
1637000	1639000	He's actually got a very small thing on top of it.
1639000	1642000	So he's actually shaking.
1642000	1643000	He's not.
1643000	1645000	It's not a very clear one.
1645000	1647000	He's got a distribution.
1647000	1648000	He's got a distribution.
1648000	1650000	That's what we call the face.
1650000	1651000	The face is not accurate.
1651000	1653000	In fact, it is this.
1653000	1654000	His.
1654000	1655000	His.
1655000	1656000	His performance.
1656000	1658000	They're only missing a factor in the middle.
1658000	1659000	That's right.
1659000	1660000	This.
1660000	1661000	Live with him.
1661000	1662000	The main thing is your gun.
1662000	1664000	The longer the laser is, the longer the gun is.
1664000	1666000	Your language can be lower.
1666000	1667000	But the longer the gun is.
1667000	1668000	It's also.
1668000	1670000	It's also equivalent to your laser.
1670000	1671000	Between the captain mode.
1671000	1672000	It's getting narrower.
1672000	1673000	If it's getting narrower.
1673000	1675000	If it's getting narrower, it's testing the design of your filter.
1675000	1677000	How to make this laser.
1677000	1678000	In.
1678000	1680000	Maintaining a single film.
1680000	1682000	Uh, it's harder to launch.
1682000	1685000	So, in order to normalize the gun, it's still.
1685000	1689000	This is a blow.
1689000	1690000	I understand.
1690000	1691000	Thank you.
1691000	1694000	Right.
1694000	1697000	That.
1697000	1698000	So we're in.
1698000	1699000	Uh, so.
1699000	1700000	We're in 2017.
1700000	1704000	When I was in the post office, we proposed a new architecture.
1704000	1706000	We call it the three X.
1706000	1709000	It's actually also part of this kind of light.
1709000	1710000	Light sensor system.
1710000	1711000	A filter effect.
1711000	1714000	So, he actually, we're talking about Bell Labs.
1714000	1717000	In 1990, he did the Y-Laser.
1717000	1719000	At the time, they had two branches.
1719000	1721000	That's the only one.
1721000	1723000	That's what we call the.
1723000	1725000	Uh, the sensor.
1725000	1727000	So his.
1727000	1729000	The SMSR is relatively low.
1729000	1731000	The top of his side wave is very smooth.
1731000	1734000	He only has 100 times the 20 dB.
1734000	1736000	Uh, his tuning range is also relatively small.
1736000	1738000	Only 8 nanometers.
1738000	1739000	But we.
1739000	1743000	Uh, based on theoretical calculations, we found that as long as you add the third R.
1743000	1745000	The third branch.
1745000	1747000	That's equivalent to the two of us.
1747000	1749000	It's equivalent to the shortest one.
1749000	1750000	This one.
1750000	1752000	We have two.
1753000	1757000	They each represent a very wide FSR and a very narrow FSR.
1757000	1760000	Uh, through this, uh, mechanism, we can introduce two.
1760000	1762000	The interference pattern of the front wave.
1762000	1763000	We can.
1763000	1766000	Max, we can design this tuning range separately.
1766000	1767000	With him.
1767000	1769000	Improve his SMSR.
1769000	1771000	To achieve a, uh.
1771000	1773000	Basically, it can decouple these two parameters.
1773000	1775000	I want to be on the Y-Laser.
1775000	1776000	These two parameters are always.
1776000	1777000	Uh, hand in hand.
1777000	1779000	You want SMSR high.
1779000	1780000	This is.
1780000	1781000	Intrinsic.
1781000	1783000	Mathematically, it's such a.
1783000	1784000	Uh, a reality.
1784000	1787000	What kind of structure does that 3X laser have?
1787000	1789000	This is a good explanation for everyone.
1789000	1790000	This is.
1790000	1792000	Uh, their transfer function.
1792000	1794000	If this is the Y-Laser.
1794000	1796000	It's the front wave we just saw.
1796000	1799000	But if there's a 3X, we add the second front wave.
1799000	1801000	We're naturally on the outside.
1801000	1803000	We're still the same as the Y-Laser.
1803000	1804000	But in essence.
1804000	1805000	In this.
1805000	1806000	We have the second.
1806000	1807000	Interference.
1807000	1808000	That is, we can.
1808000	1809000	We can.
1809000	1810000	We can take this.
1810000	1811000	It used to be very smooth.
1811000	1813000	The front wave has become very sharp.
1813000	1814000	Uh, further filter.
1814000	1815000	I don't want to.
1815000	1816000	I don't want to filter.
1816000	1817000	I don't want to.
1817000	1819000	If we're going to calculate it.
1819000	1821000	If you don't, you'll find this Y-Laser.
1821000	1823000	It's actually very dense at the top.
1823000	1824000	That is to say.
1824000	1825000	These modes.
1825000	1827000	It's actually with the main model.
1827000	1828000	That's what we want.
1828000	1829000	150 nanometers.
1829000	1830000	They're very close.
1830000	1831000	They're very close.
1831000	1832000	So, uh.
1832000	1833000	But if you add.
1833000	1835000	Like, if we add the third branch.
1835000	1837000	We can filter out a lot.
1837000	1838000	I don't want to.
1838000	1840000	You see, we only have about four or five left.
1840000	1842000	And they're with the main model.
1842000	1844000	There's a certain gap between their hands.
1844000	1845000	So we can.
1845000	1846000	So, uh.
1846000	1847000	Uh.
1847000	1848000	Uh.
1848000	1849000	Uh.
1849000	1850000	Uh.
1850000	1851000	Uh.
1851000	1852000	Uh.

1880000	1881000	Uh.
1881000	1882000	Okay.
1882000	1883000	I'll tried.
1883000	1884000	One.
1884000	1885000	I back.
1885000	1886000	And I kicked.
1886000	1888000	My body.
1888000	1889000	Just.
1889000	1890000	Uh.

3864000	3874000	Uh.
3874000	3879000	Okay, okay, thank you.
3880000	3882000	Uh.
3882000	3892000	Uh.
3892000	3902000	Uh.

3942000	3964000	Uh.
3964000	3974000	Uh.
3975000	3977000	Oh, thank you.
3977000	3991000	Um.
3991000	3993000	Uh, I, I have a question here.
3994000	3996000	Uh.
3996000	4016000	Uh.
4016000	4045000	Uh.
4045000	4047000	So this is what we call a jump.
4047000	4049000	Uh, jump filter mode.
4049000	4051000	What I just said is a jump.
4051000	4053000	Uh.
4053000	4055000	Uh.
4055000	4057000	Of course, he's testing.
4057000	4059000	It's very obvious that you can see it when you're testing.
4059000	4063000	For example, we can see that he has a middle jump here.
4063000	4064000	He jumped again.
4064000	4065000	Jumped again.
4065000	4067000	This is basically a jump.
4067000	4068000	Jump.
4068000	4069000	Uh, that's it.
4069000	4070000	You can also see this.
4070000	4071000	Every step.
4072000	4074000	That if it is.
4074000	4077000	If it's a laser, he'll jump this.
4077000	4078000	Uh, filter mode.
4078000	4080000	Yeah, that's it.
4080000	4082000	Is there any application of this?
4082000	4083000	At present.
4083000	4085000	Uh, I haven't used it yet.
4085000	4086000	And.
4086000	4088000	In fact, people hate this thing.
4088000	4090000	It's because of the time.
4090000	4092000	That represents him.
4092000	4094000	Physically, he represents two.
4094000	4095000	He competes with the carrier.
4095000	4098000	When it's the most intense, it's the same input current.
4098000	4099000	There are these two.
4099000	4101000	He's giving you at the same time.
4101000	4102000	Grab this resource.
4102000	4104000	That is, he was at that time.
4104000	4108000	Uh, noise is the biggest.
4108000	4111000	So everyone hates this thing happening.
4111000	4112000	Well, there's no way.
4112000	4113000	This is physics.
4113000	4115000	There's no way.
4115000	4116000	Uh huh.
4116000	4118000	But all of them.
4118000	4120000	With that kind of micro ring.
4120000	4121000	Will there be this problem?
4121000	4123000	Yes, all of them.
4123000	4124000	As long as there is a filter.
4124000	4125000	He will have this problem.
4125000	4127000	Uh, the most frequent.
4127000	4129000	Uh, if the L I is.
4129000	4132000	Uh, there is no filter.
4132000	4134000	As long as there is a filter, he will be like this.
4134000	4136000	Of course, he can play very high power.
4136000	4138000	But he is always multi mode.
4138000	4139000	There is no way.
4139000	4140000	Yes.
4140000	4141000	Don't worry.
4141000	4142000	Um.
4146000	4147000	Or use DFV.
4147000	4149000	DFV is a single product.
4149000	4150000	Then he.
4150000	4151000	Uh, there won't be.
4151000	4153000	This problem of motor.
4153000	4154000	Uh huh.
4158000	4159000	Hey, ask him.
4159000	4160000	His mother.
4160000	4161000	His.
4161000	4164000	Hey, can you give me some numbers?
4164000	4165000	I can't see it here.
4165000	4166000	He's probably.
4166000	4168000	How much frequency is this?
4168000	4169000	Uh, I think.
4169000	4171000	OK.
4171000	4172000	Oh, it's okay.
4172000	4175000	Hey, I want to ask another question.
4175000	4177000	Hey, a little bit.
4177000	4178000	His.
4178000	4180000	You have a character.
4180000	4181000	What is his?
4181000	4183000	Uh, relaxation.
4183000	4184000	Is the frequency of the selection?
4185000	4187000	Oh, we don't have it.
4187000	4189000	Because of this platform.
4189000	4190000	We are.
4190000	4192000	Uh, more.
4192000	4193000	We are a foreign package.
4193000	4195000	This is the Netherlands.
4195000	4196000	Uh.
4196000	4198000	But you can guess very well.
4198000	4200000	He is in the middle of 1 gigahertz to 3 gigahertz.
4200000	4202000	He is not.
4202000	4204000	He is not.
4204000	4206000	So, of course, this level.
4209000	4210000	OK.
4210000	4211000	Thank you.
4211000	4212000	Correct.
4213000	4215000	But he has something to do with his resonance gun length.
4215000	4217000	The longer your resonance gun is, the slower it is.
4217000	4218000	Correct.
4225000	4226000	OK.
4226000	4227000	Well, if not.
4227000	4231000	Then I will end this recording here first.
4231000	4232000	Thank you all.
4232000	4233000	Thank you.
4233000	4234000	Thank you.
