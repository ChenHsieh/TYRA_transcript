0	13000	Hello everyone, I am the host of today's Taira Talk on September 18th, Hong Shih-an.
13000	26000	We are very happy to invite the Sky in the World comedy science team to share with you the spirit of science communication.
26000	37000	Like Taira, the comedy science team is made up of doctoral students or post-doctoral students.
37000	41000	They also want to promote the concept of science.
41000	46000	However, what is different from Taira is that they are more towards the public,
46000	57000	and they will share their life from a scientific perspective.
57000	71000	I have personally listened to their podcasts several times, and I think what they say is very close to the life of a graduate student.
71000	75000	I highly recommend everyone to listen to their podcasts.
75000	79000	They also run a clubhouse.
79000	88000	Without further ado, let's get into today's topic, the spirit of science communication.
88000	93000	Wallace, we'll leave it to you now.
93000	95000	Okay, sure.
95000	97000	The stage is yours.
97000	99000	What?
100000	104000	Okay, so I'm going to share my screen now.
104000	107000	Everyone has prepared a video.
107000	111000	Let me know if you can see it.
111000	113000	Yes.
113000	115000	Okay.
115000	118000	Thank you, Shih-an, for the introduction.
118000	121000	I'm one of the editors of the comedy science team.
121000	123000	I'm the screenwriter.
124000	129000	I'm very happy to have this opportunity to talk to you about science communication.
129000	134000	Seeing today's title, the spirit of science communication,
134000	136000	you may have a question.
136000	139000	What is the difference between science communication and science?
139000	142000	Why do we need the title of science communication?
142000	148000	Let's share our thoughts with you in the next hour.
148000	150000	Welcome to share your opinions.
150000	154000	First of all, let me introduce myself.
154000	156000	Okay, he can't go to the next page.
156000	158000	Okay, here we go.
158000	160000	I'm Liu Yuru.
160000	162000	I'm the founder and editor of Sky Interworld.
162000	165000	My nickname is Wall, so you can call me Wall Editor.
165000	167000	My English name is Wallace.
167000	169000	It's a long name, I know.
169000	174000	Sky Interworld started as a podcast and blog in 2006.
174000	177000	It's kind of like my personal thing.
177000	179000	I was originally alone.
179000	182000	When I went to the UK to study,
182000	184000	I was busy writing my thesis.
184000	186000	It's been a while since then.
186000	190000	I came back to Taiwan in 2019.
190000	194000	I joined the overseas talent bridge project called LIFT.
194000	197000	I met a lot of super cool overseas Taiwanese,
197000	200000	including Xiao Ji, Dou Dou, CBN, and so on.
200000	202000	So did Adam.
202000	205000	The most important thing is that I found this group of friends.
206000	208000	We are willing to make an impact
208000	210000	and do something for Taiwan.
210000	214000	Let's reopen the Sky Interworld podcast.
214000	216000	For more than a year,
216000	222000	we've been running Facebook, Instagram,
222000	225000	podcasts, and Clubhouse events on Sky Interworld.
225000	228000	We're very active on these platforms.
228000	230000	We have a lot of articles.
230000	232000	We have a podcast every week.
232000	236000	We also have a book club every month on Clubhouse.
236000	239000	We also have other editors
239000	244000	coming to play with us.
244000	248000	We currently have eight permanent editors,
248000	250000	including myself.
250000	253000	I'll be sharing with you later
253000	258000	Xiao Ji, CBN, CS, CBN, and Dou Dou.
258000	260000	Let me tell you about your locations.
260000	262000	Xiao Ji is in Milan, Italy.
262000	266000	CS is in the east coast of the United States.
266000	269000	Dou Dou is in Paris, France.
269000	272000	Adam is in the west coast of the United States.
272000	275000	CBN is in Switzerland.
275000	279000	Alan is in the north of Taiwan.
279000	283000	CBN is in the Czech Republic.
283000	287000	Most of us are postdoctoral researchers
288000	290000	or teachers at school.
290000	295000	Our articles are also posted
295000	299000	on different platforms.
299000	301000	For example, Science News,
301000	303000	National Daily, and World News.
303000	305000	I don't know why World News likes us.
305000	309000	Some of these events
309000	312000	have attracted a lot of attention.
312000	314000	Some people are willing to jump in
314000	316000	and join us.
316000	318000	For example,
318000	321000	a marine biologist
321000	325000	at the coast of Maryland.
325000	329000	He is a senior
329000	332000	in the US marine policy.
332000	334000	He is a senior.
334000	337000	A British citizen
337000	339000	will also join us
339000	340000	at Clubhouse.
340000	342000	Sometimes he will join our recording.
342000	346000	Last week,
346000	348000	Tyra gave a talk.
348000	350000	She is a senior
350000	352000	in the Netherlands.
352000	354000	She is a senior in higher education.
354000	358000	She is also a very important
358000	360000	source of advice and help.
360000	364000	The article and podcast
364000	367000	published by Sky in the World
367000	371000	are all from academic journals.
371000	373000	The content of the podcast
373000	375000	includes food and science,
375000	377000	interviews with people
377000	379000	who care about cancer development,
379000	381000	a doctor's seminar
381000	383000	for researchers,
383000	385000	and a fitness seminar
385000	387000	for everyone's health.
387000	389000	Adam is the host.
389000	391000	The content of the article
391000	393000	includes interesting research,
393000	395000	academic work,
395000	397000	environmental-related reports,
397000	399000	and support for cancer development in academia.
399000	401000	The purpose of the article
401000	403000	is to promote the scientific logic
403000	405000	and spirit of the article
405000	407000	through humor.
407000	409000	The translation of the article
409000	411000	will be different.
411000	413000	For example,
413000	415000	Michael Bonkowski
415000	417000	will be translated as
417000	419000	Michael Collision Driver.
419000	421000	Elizabeth Beak
421000	423000	will be translated as
423000	425000	Elizabeth Beak.
425000	427000	The purpose of the article
427000	429000	is to promote
429000	431000	the scientific logic
431000	433000	and spirit of the article
433000	435000	through humor.
435000	437000	In addition,
437000	439000	we hope that
439000	441000	everyone will pay attention
441000	443000	to the article.
443000	445000	Sometimes it will be dissed,
445000	447000	sometimes it will be praised.
447000	449000	The reaction is a bit two-dimensional,
449000	451000	but at the same time,
451000	453000	it also creates a topic.
453000	455000	The purpose of the article
455000	457000	is to promote
457000	459000	the scientific logic
459000	461000	and spirit of the article
461000	463000	through humor.
463000	465000	The purpose of the article
465000	467000	is to promote
467000	469000	the scientific logic
469000	471000	and spirit of the article
471000	473000	through humor.
473000	475000	We do not make any profit
475000	477000	by doing this.
477000	479000	Of course,
479000	481000	those who support us
481000	483000	will be very happy.
483000	485000	But we do not make any profit
485000	487000	by doing this.
487000	489000	Let's start with
489000	491000	the history of science.
491000	493000	In January 1665,
493000	495000	the French emperor Louis XIV
495000	497000	was called Colbert.
497000	499000	In order to honor
499000	501000	the Sun King,
501000	503000	he published the first
503000	505000	academic journal,
505000	507000	which you can see
507000	509000	in the upper left corner.
509000	511000	Its translation is
511000	513000	called The Scholar's Journal.
513000	515000	In March of the same year,
515000	517000	the Royal Academy of Sciences
517000	519000	also began a report on natural science.
519000	521000	It was the beginning of
521000	523000	scientific dissemination,
523000	525000	the beginning of scientific journals.
525000	527000	In the scientific field
527000	529000	of scientists,
529000	531000	they began to communicate
531000	533000	with each other.
533000	535000	At that time,
535000	537000	in Europe in the 17th century,
537000	539000	science was already developed
539000	541000	in the Roman era.
541000	543000	There was no need
543000	545000	to challenge existing knowledge.
545000	547000	Therefore,
547000	549000	many scientific experiments
549000	551000	and new ideas
551000	553000	came from science
553000	555000	as an entertainment activity
555000	557000	for the rich.
557000	559000	Why do we need money?
559000	561000	Look at the picture
561000	563000	below,
563000	565000	the boy and the girl.
565000	567000	The girl is his wife.
567000	569000	The experiment equipment
569000	571000	on the table in front
571000	573000	is made of glass.
573000	575000	The glass is so big
575000	577000	that it blows into
577000	579000	various strange shapes.
579000	581000	At that time,
581000	583000	it was very expensive,
583000	585000	so only the upper class
585000	587000	would play with it.
587000	589000	Of course,
589000	591000	such scientific dissemination
591000	593000	was only limited to
593000	595000	the upper class.
595000	597000	However,
597000	599000	with the rapid development of science,
599000	601000	science is no longer
601000	603000	just an entertainment activity
603000	605000	for the rich.
605000	607000	It will become a factor
607000	609000	that affects life in all aspects.
609000	611000	From the change of people's lifestyle
611000	613000	to the formation of public policy,
613000	615000	modern people need
615000	617000	scientific logic and concepts
617000	619000	to avoid becoming a bright world
619000	621000	that leads everyone
621000	623000	to become scientific journalists.
623000	625000	In Taiwan,
625000	627000	there is no such thing.
627000	629000	When you hear the word
629000	631000	science,
631000	633000	people think it's nonsense.
633000	635000	For example,
635000	637000	people are waiting
637000	639000	to hear some useless
639000	641000	British research.
641000	643000	I also watched the ad
643000	645000	of Vogue magazine.
645000	647000	I was very curious
647000	649000	about the science of fashion.
649000	651000	When I was teaching Vogue,
651000	653000	I thought
653000	655000	the word science
655000	657000	had been misused.
657000	659000	At that time,
659000	661000	I thought I should buy
661000	663000	a new dictionary
663000	665000	to see if the definition
665000	667000	of science had changed.
667000	669000	Because science
669000	671000	had been distorted,
671000	673000	several editors
673000	675000	from Sky Inner World
675000	677000	decided to disseminate
677000	679000	the concept of scientific life
679000	681000	in our lab
681000	683000	through various
683000	685000	social media platforms
685000	687000	to attract more
687000	689000	listeners.
689000	691000	At the same time,
691000	693000	we also care about
693000	695000	friends in the academic circle
695000	697000	and hope to share
697000	699000	the opinions of the editors
699000	701000	to help more friends
701000	703000	who are interested
703000	705000	in science and want to
705000	707000	learn more about
707000	709000	the science of comedy.
711000	713000	Hi, everyone.
713000	715000	I'm Xiao-Ji.
715000	717000	First of all,
717000	719000	if we want to make
719000	721000	science successful,
721000	723000	we need to let the general public
723000	725000	know what PhD is.
725000	727000	We need to know
727000	729000	what PhD is.
729000	731000	This is an introduction
731000	733000	from a professor in the US,
733000	735000	who introduces PhDs
735000	737000	every autumn.
737000	739000	I think this picture
739000	741000	is very interesting.
741000	743000	I think many people have seen it.
743000	745000	Let's recall it.
745000	747000	First of all,
747000	749000	you see a circle.
749000	751000	This circle represents
751000	753000	the knowledge of all humans.
753000	755000	Next.
755000	757000	You see a blue dot in the middle.
757000	759000	This is where we started
759000	761000	to learn about the world
761000	763000	We are in the middle.
763000	765000	Next.
765000	767000	As we grow up,
767000	769000	we learn more and more knowledge.
769000	771000	From elementary school,
771000	773000	high school, and university
773000	775000	to the university,
775000	777000	we start to have a specialization.
777000	779000	Our knowledge starts to go in a certain direction.
779000	781000	After the specialization,
781000	783000	we may have read a master's degree.
783000	785000	Finally, we decide to
785000	787000	get a PhD.
787000	789000	As our knowledge goes forward,
789000	791000	we have to face
791000	793000	the unknown.
793000	795000	As we face the unknown,
795000	797000	we work hard
797000	799000	to study
799000	801000	what others don't know.
801000	803000	After many years of struggle,
803000	805000	we finally have a new discovery.
805000	807000	Next.
807000	809000	As we move forward,
809000	811000	the knowledge of all humans
811000	813000	takes a small step.
813000	815000	This small step is
815000	817000	our life experience.
817000	819000	Next.
819000	821000	From our perspective,
821000	823000	we stand here
823000	825000	and look at
825000	827000	where the knowledge of all humans
827000	829000	is.
829000	831000	I think I have made
831000	833000	a big step.
833000	835000	Next.
835000	837000	When we look back,
837000	839000	we realize that
839000	841000	the knowledge of all humans
841000	843000	is very small.
843000	845000	So, the PhD is
845000	847000	right.
847000	849000	We may call it
849000	851000	Psychology.
851000	853000	I don't like the name.
853000	855000	On the other hand,
855000	857000	we are PhDs
857000	859000	because
859000	861000	we learned
861000	863000	how to
863000	865000	face the unknown systematically
865000	867000	and
867000	869000	learn new knowledge.
869000	871000	We can apply
871000	873000	this method
873000	875000	to other areas.
875000	877000	Even if we make a breakthrough,
877000	879000	we can apply this method
879000	881000	to other areas.
881000	883000	We must remember this.
883000	885000	If we forget that
885000	887000	what we learned is not only professional knowledge,
887000	889000	but also a whole set of research methods,
889000	891000	we will become advanced technicians.
891000	893000	We are just technicians
893000	895000	who know how to operate
895000	897000	strange machines.
897000	899000	Next.
899000	901000	When we do research,
901000	903000	we need to face the unknown.
903000	905000	We often say that we need to learn the ivory tower.
905000	907000	It seems that what we do
907000	909000	has nothing to do with everyday life.
909000	911000	Of course, we need to learn the ivory tower,
911000	913000	but why is it there?
913000	915000	It makes sense.
915000	917000	Next.
917000	919000	When we face the unknown,
919000	921000	no one knows the answer.
921000	923000	How can we find the answer?
923000	925000	We can only make assumptions.
925000	927000	We always make assumptions
927000	929000	and try to prove it.
929000	931000	We always end up
931000	933000	at the bottom of the theory.
933000	935000	Even if we can prove it,
935000	937000	we still need to apply it in our daily life.
937000	939000	There is a big difference between theory and reality.
939000	941000	For example,
941000	943000	I am doing diagnostic research.
943000	945000	We often say that
945000	947000	early diagnosis means early treatment.
947000	949000	Early diagnosis is a great topic.
949000	951000	I made a result.
951000	953000	This result
953000	955000	is a simple
955000	957000	example.
957000	959000	A week before a patient caught a cold,
959000	961000	I knew he had a cold.
961000	963000	So I went to my boss.
963000	965000	Boss,
965000	967000	I found something.
967000	969000	A week before a patient caught a cold,
969000	971000	I knew he would have a cold next week.
971000	973000	I can tell him
973000	975000	if he will have a cold next week.
975000	977000	My boss is a doctor.
977000	979000	He told me that
979000	981000	it is useless.
981000	983000	What if I have a cold next week?
983000	985000	I said yes.
985000	987000	There is a big difference between theory and reality.
987000	989000	Theoretically, early diagnosis
989000	991000	is a good thing.
991000	993000	But when we apply it,
993000	995000	there are more considerations.
995000	997000	Next slide.
997000	999000	Second,
999000	1001000	we want to quantify science.
1001000	1003000	In order to quantify science,
1003000	1005000	we need a set of tools
1005000	1007000	to tell us the final result.
1007000	1009000	This set of tools is statistics.
1009000	1011000	Statistics is a very powerful tool.
1011000	1013000	But there is a limitation.
1013000	1015000	First,
1015000	1017000	when we do research,
1017000	1019000	we can't
1019000	1021000	study everyone.
1021000	1023000	For example,
1023000	1025000	if I want to study a patient,
1025000	1027000	I can't study all the patients in the world.
1027000	1029000	We may see a scientific article
1029000	1031000	about a breakthrough in cancer treatment.
1031000	1033000	We successfully treated this cancer.
1033000	1035000	If you read that article,
1035000	1037000	they successfully treated five patients.
1037000	1039000	Can these five patients
1039000	1041000	represent all the cancer patients in the world?
1041000	1043000	This is the sample
1043000	1045000	we got today.
1045000	1047000	Can the sample represent
1047000	1049000	the entire population?
1049000	1051000	Another example is
1051000	1053000	the presidential election.
1053000	1055000	Before the presidential election,
1055000	1057000	there were many polling stations.
1057000	1059000	Polling is a different
1059000	1061000	example of the same country.
1061000	1063000	This is the sample.
1063000	1065000	If the voters
1065000	1067000	support this candidate,
1067000	1069000	the result will be different.
1069000	1071000	Today,
1071000	1073000	the first point of statistics
1073000	1075000	is whether the sample can
1075000	1077000	reflect the reality of the society.
1077000	1079000	The second point of statistics is
1079000	1081000	when we do scientific research,
1081000	1083000	we can see the difference in statistics.
1083000	1085000	In short,
1085000	1087000	it tells you that
1087000	1089000	the result is very likely to be right.
1089000	1091000	In other words,
1091000	1093000	there must be a possibility that the result is wrong.
1093000	1095000	Even if we
1095000	1097000	make a very beautiful result,
1097000	1099000	there is no way
1099000	1101000	to be 100% sure
1101000	1103000	that the result is right.
1103000	1105000	In the development stage of science,
1105000	1107000	the key point is that
1107000	1109000	we can't know
1109000	1111000	whether we are right or wrong.
1111000	1113000	So when do we know
1113000	1115000	the result is right?
1115000	1117000	We have to wait
1117000	1119000	for different scientists
1119000	1121000	from all over the world
1121000	1123000	to test the result
1123000	1125000	in different ways
1125000	1127000	to make sure
1127000	1129000	that the result is right.
1129000	1131000	At this point,
1131000	1133000	we can apply the results
1133000	1135000	to our daily lives.
1135000	1137000	So today,
1137000	1139000	when we face the unknown
1139000	1141000	in front of the academic circle,
1141000	1143000	what we do
1143000	1145000	will really make a difference in our lives.
1145000	1147000	Most of the things
1147000	1149000	we do
1149000	1151000	cannot be applied
1151000	1153000	to our daily lives in an instant.
1153000	1155000	But when we finally
1155000	1157000	make a mature decision
1157000	1159000	to apply it to our daily lives,
1159000	1161000	we have to promote it to the public.
1161000	1163000	Let's move on to the next slide.
1163000	1165000	Today, we published an academic article.
1165000	1167000	What do you think
1167000	1169000	about it?
1169000	1171000	First of all,
1171000	1173000	academic articles require
1173000	1175000	very precise writing.
1175000	1177000	So today,
1177000	1179000	the sentence must be clear.
1179000	1181000	We can go back and read the paper
1181000	1183000	and still can't find the sentence.
1183000	1185000	The sentence is still in English.
1185000	1187000	When you translate it into Chinese,
1187000	1189000	it's even more difficult to understand.
1189000	1191000	But academic articles require accuracy.
1191000	1193000	You really can't delete a single word.
1193000	1195000	So it's a very painful reading experience
1195000	1197000	for most people.
1197000	1199000	Second,
1199000	1201000	academic articles have too many
1201000	1203000	special names and are very long.
1203000	1205000	So we start to abbreviate.
1205000	1207000	I don't even know
1207000	1209000	whether it's an abbreviation
1209000	1211000	or an abbreviation.
1211000	1213000	So for most people,
1213000	1215000	it's really hard to remember.
1215000	1217000	Third,
1217000	1219000	as I said,
1219000	1221000	when we write an article,
1221000	1223000	it may be overturned.
1223000	1225000	Even if the probability is very low,
1225000	1227000	the probability that I wrote
1227000	1229000	1% or 0.1% is not correct.
1229000	1231000	I can't speak slowly.
1231000	1233000	So we usually end up
1233000	1235000	writing that our research results
1235000	1237000	support the theory of A very much.
1237000	1239000	But at the same time,
1239000	1241000	B and C may also be correct.
1241000	1243000	At the same time,
1243000	1245000	we do not rule out the possibility
1245000	1247000	that D is also correct.
1251000	1253000	So basically,
1253000	1255000	these three sentences sum up.
1255000	1257000	In short,
1257000	1259000	if you see it,
1259000	1261000	you don't understand it.
1261000	1263000	If we let scholars
1263000	1265000	directly talk to the public,
1265000	1267000	there will be a second question.
1267000	1269000	First,
1269000	1271000	when we talk about science,
1271000	1273000	we become scholars.
1273000	1275000	Everything must be very clear.
1275000	1277000	Everything must be very correct.
1277000	1279000	So even the words we say
1279000	1281000	are almost the same as
1281000	1283000	the paper we wrote.
1283000	1285000	So the public may not understand
1285000	1287000	what they see or hear.
1287000	1289000	In fact, the level of understanding
1289000	1291000	has not improved.
1291000	1293000	The second question is
1293000	1295000	The second question is
1295000	1297000	Captain
1299000	1301000	Captain
1301000	1303000	We have technical issues.
1303000	1305000	We have technical issues.
1305000	1307000	The second question is
1307000	1309000	because we are learning
1309000	1311000	science today,
1311000	1313000	it teaches us not to criticize.
1313000	1315000	So as long as we hear something wrong,
1315000	1317000	we immediately want to point it out.
1317000	1319000	We are trained to ask questions
1319000	1321000	that are very clear and correct.
1321000	1323000	Just like we talked about
1323000	1325000	in a previous podcast,
1325000	1327000	many people
1327000	1329000	start to get red
1329000	1331000	after eating seafood porridge.
1331000	1333000	Many people say they are allergic.
1333000	1335000	But in some cases,
1335000	1337000	they are actually poisoned, not allergic.
1337000	1339000	So you can imagine
1339000	1341000	that a friend came to me and said,
1341000	1343000	Xiaoxi, I just ate seafood porridge
1343000	1345000	and I'm allergic to red.
1345000	1347000	What should I do?
1347000	1349000	The point of this question is
1349000	1351000	But when my scholar soul
1351000	1353000	came up, I heard this question,
1353000	1355000	I just wanted to tell him that
1355000	1357000	you are not allergic, you are poisoned.
1357000	1359000	This is very accurate and important to me.
1359000	1361000	But this is not helpful
1361000	1363000	to the people who are asking for answers today.
1363000	1365000	So I think
1365000	1367000	when we are in contact with ordinary people,
1367000	1369000	we must suppress our scholar soul.
1369000	1371000	We have to be able to accept
1371000	1373000	that maybe this question is very broad
1373000	1375000	and not so accurate,
1375000	1377000	but it doesn't matter.
1377000	1379000	If we get the information
1379000	1381000	he wants to know today,
1381000	1383000	can we give him a simple
1383000	1385000	take-home message after the explanation?
1385000	1387000	After listening to a bunch of academic analysis,
1387000	1389000	he can still have a very clear
1389000	1391000	1, 2, 3 to follow.
1391000	1393000	And then
1393000	1395000	if we find out today
1395000	1397000	that he asked this question too broadly
1397000	1399000	and couldn't answer it,
1399000	1401000	this is usually the case.
1401000	1403000	Can we explain to him
1403000	1405000	how complicated this question is
1405000	1407000	so that the answer is not so easy?
1407000	1409000	So next time
1409000	1411000	if he encounters any false information,
1411000	1413000	just tell him so simply.
1413000	1415000	Maybe he can understand
1415000	1417000	that it's not that easy.
1417000	1419000	Because
1419000	1421000	this may not be true.
1421000	1423000	Because I know this thing is very difficult.
1423000	1425000	So in the end,
1425000	1427000	when we want to pass science to the general public,
1427000	1429000	the most important thing is
1429000	1431000	the skill of speaking and the art of communication.
1431000	1433000	This is actually very lacking
1433000	1435000	in our doctoral training.
1435000	1437000	But in fact,
1437000	1439000	in the future,
1439000	1441000	it is very important in life.
1441000	1443000	This kind of communication is not just internal.
1443000	1445000	We communicate with people in our lab,
1445000	1447000	with scholars in our field,
1447000	1449000	with scholars in other fields,
1449000	1451000	and even with the general public.
1451000	1453000	We all have different skills of communication.
1453000	1455000	There are even those above and those below.
1455000	1457000	I found something today.
1457000	1459000	How do I convince my boss?
1459000	1461000	He must support me.
1461000	1463000	In addition to my professional skills,
1463000	1465000	I also need to learn
1465000	1467000	the rules of science.
1467000	1469000	How do I pass this spirit
1469000	1471000	to the next generation?
1471000	1473000	So in the end, the most important thing is communication.
1473000	1475000	Speaking of communication,
1475000	1477000	let's give the floor to CS.
1479000	1481000	Have you heard my voice?
1481000	1483000	Yes.
1485000	1487000	I don't know how.
1487000	1489000	Okay.
1489000	1491000	CS can't come today.
1491000	1493000	He has a recording.
1493000	1495000	I'll play it here.
1497000	1499000	I'm going to share
1499000	1501000	with you
1501000	1503000	the starting point
1503000	1505000	of Sky in the World.
1505000	1507000	I'll share with you
1507000	1509000	the starting point of Sky in the World.
1509000	1511000	Sky in the World
1511000	1513000	has many hosts.
1513000	1515000	Everyone is in
1515000	1517000	almost different countries,
1517000	1519000	even different time zones.
1519000	1521000	Everyone has a different background.
1521000	1523000	In the interview
1523000	1525000	we invited,
1525000	1527000	in the interview
1527000	1529000	we invited
1529000	1531000	very experienced
1531000	1533000	professors
1533000	1535000	who are about
1535000	1537000	the same age as us,
1537000	1539000	but very good at teaching.
1539000	1541000	We also found a position
1541000	1543000	for seniors
1543000	1545000	who are
1545000	1547000	older than us.
1547000	1549000	Sometimes
1549000	1551000	through
1551000	1553000	Facebook fan page,
1553000	1555000	we also met
1555000	1557000	people who asked
1557000	1559000	if they should study in a PhD program.
1559000	1561000	Things like that.
1561000	1563000	This kind of
1563000	1565000	horizontal communication
1565000	1567000	between peers
1567000	1569000	and seniors
1569000	1571000	is a kind of
1571000	1573000	horizontal communication.
1573000	1575000	How do we
1575000	1577000	coordinate?
1577000	1579000	At the beginning of the sharing,
1579000	1581000	I'm going to ask
1581000	1583000	this question first.
1583000	1585000	It's on PowerPoint.
1585000	1587000	1 plus 1.
1587000	1589000	What's the answer
1589000	1591000	to this 1 plus 1?
1591000	1593000	Some people might think it's 2,
1593000	1595000	a very simple number.
1595000	1597000	Some people might think it's 2.
1597000	1599000	Or some people might think
1599000	1601000	1 drop of water plus 1 drop of water
1601000	1603000	is a big number.
1603000	1605000	Or 1 mouse plus 1 mouse
1605000	1607000	is a bunch of mice.
1607000	1609000	There are many answers.
1609000	1611000	When I first
1611000	1613000	joined Sky and World,
1613000	1615000	when faced with some questions,
1615000	1617000	my reaction was
1617000	1619000	2.
1619000	1621000	It's very certain.
1621000	1623000	There's no room for compromise.
1623000	1625000	In this world,
1625000	1627000	2 is the only standard answer.
1627000	1629000	Then,
1629000	1631000	I realized
1631000	1633000	that other hosts
1633000	1635000	have a different
1635000	1637000	reaction from me.
1637000	1639000	Why can they
1639000	1641000	ask questions
1641000	1643000	to so many people?
1643000	1645000	Today,
1645000	1647000	I started to
1647000	1649000	see how they
1649000	1651000	ask questions.
1651000	1653000	I found one thing
1653000	1655000	different from my experience.
1655000	1657000	What they think
1657000	1659000	is the connection
1659000	1661000	between their profession
1661000	1663000	and the question.
1663000	1665000	Or,
1665000	1667000	what's the connection
1667000	1669000	between their life
1669000	1671000	and the question
1671000	1673000	we're going to discuss?
1673000	1675000	It's a very special way.
1675000	1677000	When I started
1677000	1679000	to think in this direction,
1679000	1681000	when I removed
1681000	1683000	the standard answer frame
1683000	1685000	to the scientific question,
1685000	1687000	I also removed
1687000	1689000	the frame
1689000	1691000	from myself.
1691000	1693000	I stopped thinking
1693000	1695000	about the standard answer
1695000	1697000	or the pathway
1697000	1699000	or mechanism
1699000	1701000	it should follow.
1701000	1703000	I stopped
1703000	1705000	thinking
1705000	1707000	in a certain way.
1707000	1709000	I also removed
1709000	1711000	the frame
1711000	1713000	from others.
1713000	1715000	I think
1715000	1717000	they should
1717000	1719000	think in the same way.
1719000	1721000	But I started
1721000	1723000	to accept,
1723000	1725000	to discover,
1725000	1727000	to feel
1727000	1729000	their way of thinking.
1729000	1731000	I found that
1731000	1733000	the question became so interesting.
1733000	1735000	The question became so interesting.
1735000	1737000	In all sciences,
1737000	1739000	we introduce
1739000	1741000	history,
1741000	1743000	chemistry,
1743000	1745000	immunology,
1745000	1747000	or brain science.
1747000	1749000	We often introduce
1749000	1751000	very special foods
1751000	1753000	that people have never thought of.
1753000	1755000	We want
1755000	1757000	the audience
1757000	1759000	to feel
1759000	1761000	the same connection
1761000	1763000	between
1763000	1765000	their favorite
1765000	1767000	history,
1767000	1769000	science,
1769000	1771000	or
1771000	1773000	the life
1773000	1775000	they have never thought of.
1775000	1777000	Some people
1777000	1779000	like
1779000	1781000	special things.
1781000	1783000	It sounds
1783000	1785000	like
1785000	1787000	we can't find the answer.
1787000	1789000	But if we
1789000	1791000	find it,
1791000	1793000	it will be very rich.
1793000	1795000	This is what I want to say.
1795000	1797000	We should remove the frame.
1797000	1799000	We should remove
1799000	1801000	the frame
1801000	1803000	that has been
1803000	1805000	in the academic circle
1805000	1807000	for a long time.
1807000	1809000	We should think
1809000	1811000	how to connect
1811000	1813000	the theme.
1813000	1815000	We should
1815000	1817000	think through
1817000	1819000	other people's questions
1819000	1821000	and thoughts.
1821000	1823000	Why don't I have
1823000	1825000	other thoughts?
1825000	1827000	This kind of thought
1827000	1829000	is very good.
1829000	1831000	But science is a
1831000	1833000	subject that
1833000	1835000	we can think about
1835000	1837000	from various angles.
1837000	1839000	We should
1839000	1841000	communicate with each other
1841000	1843000	and
1843000	1845000	remove the frame.
1845000	1847000	What about the audience?
1847000	1849000	When we face
1849000	1851000	many seniors
1851000	1853000	or
1853000	1855000	when we become
1855000	1857000	their seniors,
1857000	1859000	do we
1859000	1861000	remove the frame?
1861000	1863000	Of course we do.
1863000	1865000	We remove the frame
1865000	1867000	because
1867000	1869000	there is
1869000	1871000	a gap between us.
1871000	1873000	Some people are up, some people are down.
1873000	1875000	Sometimes we are down, others are up.
1875000	1877000	Sometimes we become
1877000	1879000	other people's seniors.
1879000	1881000	Some people are up, some people are down.
1881000	1883000	In this case,
1883000	1885000	how should we
1885000	1887000	face the audience?
1887000	1889000	Do we
1889000	1891000	have to listen to
1891000	1893000	the seniors?
1893000	1895000	Do we have to
1895000	1897000	ask questions
1897000	1899000	or
1899000	1901000	ask our questions?
1901000	1903000	If we keep doing this,
1903000	1905000	we can't do the program.
1905000	1907000	We can't record the program.
1907000	1909000	We can't give a speech,
1909000	1911000	but we can't interview.
1911000	1913000	What we did
1913000	1915000	was
1915000	1917000	to remove
1917000	1919000	the focus
1919000	1921000	from the position
1921000	1923000	and
1923000	1925000	move to
1925000	1927000	the topic we wanted to discuss.
1927000	1929000	Whether it's a
1929000	1931000	science or
1931000	1933000	an interview,
1933000	1935000	the topic is neutral.
1935000	1937000	When we focus
1937000	1939000	on these issues,
1939000	1941000	we can jump
1941000	1943000	out of the
1943000	1945000	top-to-bottom
1945000	1947000	and
1947000	1949000	discuss a topic,
1949000	1951000	instead of
1951000	1953000	looking at what the elders
1953000	1955000	want to say to us.
1955000	1957000	It's not the same.
1957000	1959000	We can still learn
1959000	1961000	from the elders
1961000	1963000	in the interview.
1963000	1965000	When we discuss
1965000	1967000	with the elders,
1967000	1969000	we can
1969000	1971000	also learn from them.
1973000	1975000	However,
1975000	1977000	learning is not
1977000	1979000	about who
1979000	1981000	should learn, who should listen,
1981000	1983000	who should share, who should listen.
1983000	1985000	Instead,
1985000	1987000	this topic
1987000	1989000	is very interesting.
1989000	1991000	Let's think about
1991000	1993000	the starting point
1993000	1995000	for different people.
1995000	1997000	What would it look like?
1997000	1999000	In the interview,
1999000	2001000	we often
2001000	2003000	discuss
2003000	2005000	the topic
2005000	2007000	as
2007000	2009000	it sounds
2009000	2011000	neutral.
2011000	2013000	However,
2013000	2015000	it can be
2015000	2017000	exciting.
2017000	2019000	In this case,
2019000	2021000	we can learn
2021000	2023000	how to
2023000	2025000	understand
2025000	2027000	the atmosphere
2027000	2029000	and the process.
2029000	2031000	The most important thing
2031000	2033000	is that
2033000	2035000	we can
2035000	2037000	discuss
2037000	2039000	the topic
2039000	2041000	first.
2041000	2043000	Then,
2043000	2045000	we can
2045000	2047000	focus on
2047000	2049000	the topic.
2049000	2051000	This is what I want to share
2051000	2053000	with you today.
2053000	2055000	Actually,
2055000	2057000	we have heard about
2057000	2059000	frameworks.
2059000	2061000	Frameworks often
2061000	2063000	appear in our life.
2063000	2065000	I want to
2065000	2067000	remind you
2067000	2069000	that
2069000	2071000	we should
2071000	2073000	learn from
2073000	2075000	the elders.
2075000	2077000	Now,
2077000	2079000	let's welcome
2079000	2081000	Ren.
2083000	2085000	I want to
2085000	2087000	remind you
2087000	2089000	that
2089000	2091000	we should
2091000	2093000	learn from
2093000	2095000	the elders.
2095000	2097000	I want to
2097000	2099000	remind you
2099000	2101000	that
2101000	2103000	we should
2103000	2105000	learn from
2105000	2107000	the elders.
2107000	2109000	I am a health-related
2109000	2111000	scientist.
2111000	2113000	I am doing research
2113000	2115000	on sports.
2115000	2117000	We all know
2117000	2119000	that
2119000	2121000	it is not
2121000	2123000	a matter of
2123000	2125000	one or two days.
2125000	2127000	Many scholars
2127000	2129000	are thinking about
2129000	2131000	how to
2131000	2133000	deal with
2133000	2135000	death.
2135000	2137000	This is my
2137000	2139000	evidence-based research.
2139000	2141000	However,
2141000	2143000	it does not
2143000	2145000	happen naturally.
2145000	2147000	I am from
2147000	2149000	the US.
2149000	2151000	NIH
2151000	2153000	did not mention
2153000	2155000	clinical trial.
2155000	2157000	From T0 to
2157000	2159000	T3 and T4,
2159000	2161000	it is not
2161000	2163000	a matter of
2163000	2165000	one or two days.
2165000	2167000	I want to
2167000	2169000	remind you
2169000	2171000	that
2171000	2173000	it is not
2173000	2175000	a matter of
2175000	2177000	one or two days.
2177000	2179000	I want to
2179000	2181000	remind you
2181000	2183000	that
2183000	2185000	it is not
2185000	2187000	a matter of
2187000	2189000	one or two days.
2189000	2191000	I want to
2191000	2193000	remind you
2193000	2195000	that
2195000	2197000	it is not
2197000	2199000	a matter of
2199000	2201000	one or two days.
2201000	2203000	I want to
2203000	2205000	remind you
2205000	2207000	that
2207000	2209000	it is not
2209000	2211000	a matter of
2211000	2213000	one or two days.
2213000	2215000	I want to
2215000	2217000	remind you
2217000	2219000	that
2219000	2221000	it is not
2221000	2223000	a matter of
2223000	2225000	one or two days.
2225000	2227000	I want to
2227000	2229000	remind you
2229000	2231000	that
2231000	2233000	it is not
2233000	2235000	a matter of
2235000	2237000	one or two days.
2237000	2239000	I want to
2239000	2241000	remind you
2241000	2243000	that
2243000	2245000	it is not
2245000	2247000	a matter of
2247000	2249000	one or two days.
2249000	2251000	I want to
2251000	2253000	remind you
2253000	2255000	that
2255000	2257000	it is not
2257000	2259000	a matter of
2259000	2261000	one or two days.
2261000	2263000	I want to
2263000	2265000	remind you
2265000	2267000	that
2267000	2269000	it is not
2269000	2271000	a matter of
2271000	2273000	one or two days.
2273000	2275000	I want to
2275000	2277000	remind you
2277000	2279000	that
2279000	2281000	it is not

2285000	2287000	I want to
2287000	2289000	remind you
2289000	2291000	that
2291000	2293000	it is not
2293000	2295000	a matter of
2295000	2297000	one or two days.
2297000	2299000	I want to
2299000	2301000	remind you

3797000	3799000	I want to
3799000	3801000	remind you
3801000	3803000	that
3803000	3805000	it is not
3805000	3807000	a matter of
3807000	3809000	one or two days.
3809000	3811000	I want to
3811000	3813000	remind you
3813000	3815000	that
3815000	3817000	it is not
3817000	3819000	a matter of
3819000	3821000	one or two days.
3821000	3823000	I want to
3823000	3825000	remind you
3825000	3827000	that
3827000	3829000	it is not
3829000	3831000	a matter of
3831000	3833000	one or two days.
3833000	3835000	I want to
3835000	3837000	remind you
3837000	3839000	that
3839000	3841000	it is not
3841000	3843000	a matter of
3843000	3845000	one or two days.
3845000	3847000	I want to
3847000	3849000	remind you
3849000	3851000	that
3851000	3853000	it is not
3853000	3855000	a matter of
3855000	3857000	one or two days.
3857000	3859000	I want to
3859000	3861000	remind you
3861000	3863000	that
3863000	3865000	it is not
3865000	3867000	a matter of
3867000	3869000	one or two days.
3869000	3871000	I want to remind you
3871000	3873000	that
3873000	3875000	it is not
3875000	3877000	a matter of
3877000	3879000	one or two days.
3879000	3881000	I want to
3881000	3883000	remind you
3883000	3885000	that
3885000	3887000	it is not
3887000	3889000	a matter of
3889000	3891000	one or two days.
3891000	3893000	Before we look into
3893000	3895000	some of the
3895000	3897000	previous experiences,
3897000	3899000	we hope
3899000	3901000	that we can
3901000	3903000	invite
3903000	3905000	more
3905000	3907000	seniors
3907000	3909000	to share
3909000	3911000	their experiences
3911000	3913000	and thoughts.
3913000	3915000	Later, our audience
3915000	3917000	may gradually shift to
3917000	3919000	doctors or researchers,
3919000	3921000	researchers and employees.
3921000	3923000	However,
3923000	3925000	we hope that
3925000	3927000	the public
3927000	3929000	will be able to
3929000	3931000	see and understand
3931000	3933000	what scientific debate
3933000	3935000	looks like.
3935000	3937000	I know that
3937000	3939000	a lot of people
3939000	3941000	who study literature
3941000	3943000	or sociology
3943000	3945000	think that
3945000	3947000	scientific debates are
3947000	3949000	a bit deep,
3949000	3951000	but the jokes are funny.
3951000	3953000	I think that's enough.
3955000	3957000	I don't know if that answers
3957000	3959000	your question.
3967000	3969000	Is Alan speaking?
3969000	3971000	I just want to
3971000	3973000	add something.
3973000	3975000	Our team discussed
3975000	3977000	that we need people
3977000	3979000	with a literary background
3979000	3981000	or an artistic background
3981000	3983000	to discuss with us.
3983000	3985000	So,
3985000	3987000	we don't mean
3987000	3989000	to attack the literary community.
3989000	3991000	They can understand
3991000	3993000	these scientific things.
3993000	3995000	Absolutely.
3995000	3997000	Some of the people
3997000	3999000	we often collaborate with,
3999000	4001000	such as Clubhouse,
4001000	4003000	we have invited professors
4003000	4005000	from the Department of Philosophy
4005000	4007000	at the University of Miami.
4007000	4009000	This is a wonderful
4009000	4011000	field of study.
4011000	4013000	We can get to know
4013000	4015000	a lot of wonderful fields
4015000	4017000	through this platform.
4017000	4019000	We've never thought about
4019000	4021000	biotechnology or biophysics.
4021000	4023000	We've never heard of them,
4023000	4025000	but we've invited them
4025000	4027000	so that we can get to know
4027000	4029000	these different fields.
4029000	4031000	This is a part of cross-communication.
4031000	4033000	Scholars from different fields
4033000	4035000	communicate with each other
4035000	4037000	through this platform.
4037000	4039000	This is one of the things
4039000	4041000	we want to do.
4041000	4043000	This platform is very free.
4043000	4045000	In today's presentation,
4045000	4047000	the content is very free.
4047000	4049000	You can choose a topic
4049000	4051000	and go home to prepare.
4051000	4053000	You don't have to say
4053000	4055000	what you want to say.
4055000	4057000	It's a platform
4057000	4059000	you can use.
4059000	4061000	Any other questions?
4061000	4063000	I'd like to ask
4063000	4065000	a question about
4065000	4067000	what makes you feel
4067000	4069000	connected to the
4069000	4071000	Department of Philosophy.
4073000	4075000	I think it's about
4075000	4077000	choosing a boss.
4079000	4081000	I've been thinking
4081000	4083000	about
4083000	4085000	choosing a boss.
4087000	4089000	There was a talk
4089000	4091000	by Tara
4091000	4093000	from the Department of Chemistry
4093000	4095000	in Houston.
4095000	4097000	She said
4097000	4099000	she had prepared
4101000	4103000	a talk
4103000	4105000	about choosing a boss.
4105000	4107000	I talked to her
4107000	4109000	about it.
4109000	4111000	I think
4111000	4113000	we all have a common conclusion
4113000	4115000	that choosing a boss
4117000	4119000	is more than 50% by luck.
4119000	4121000	You've made
4121000	4123000	a lot of decisions
4123000	4125000	along the way,
4125000	4127000	but sometimes
4127000	4129000	by luck is a good decision.
4129000	4131000	I think
4131000	4133000	it's okay.
4133000	4135000	I feel the same way.
4135000	4137000	I think
4137000	4139000	the benefits of this platform
4139000	4141000	are quite interesting.
4141000	4143000	First,
4143000	4145000	I want to share
4145000	4147000	these things
4147000	4149000	so that people
4149000	4151000	on the same path
4153000	4155000	can have a better reference.
4155000	4157000	I also want to tell them
4157000	4159000	that if you make a decision,
4159000	4161000	it turns out that it's not a good decision
4161000	4163000	and it's not your problem.
4163000	4165000	It seems like
4165000	4167000	you have a lot of stories
4167000	4169000	to share.
4169000	4171000	You're welcome to join us.
4171000	4173000	Actually,
4173000	4175000	Sky in the World
4175000	4177000	has a good thing.
4177000	4179000	These people
4179000	4181000	have a lot of connections
4181000	4183000	in their interpersonal relationships.
4183000	4185000	We have some
4185000	4187000	internal information
4187000	4189000	about some
4189000	4191000	recruits
4191000	4193000	or job positions.
4193000	4195000	Editors
4195000	4197000	will share with each other.
4197000	4199000	If you join our team,
4199000	4201000	you'll hear a lot about
4201000	4203000	where to apply.
4203000	4205000	My job now
4205000	4207000	is to introduce.
4209000	4211000	Like you said,
4211000	4213000	sometimes you
4213000	4215000	accidentally throw it out.
4215000	4217000	Is there anyone
4217000	4219000	you know
4219000	4221000	who thinks it's suitable for this job?
4221000	4223000	Maybe some people
4223000	4225000	catch it.
4229000	4231000	Yeah.
4231000	4233000	Go ahead.
4233000	4235000	I just want to say
4235000	4237000	that I heard
4237000	4239000	the podcast
4239000	4241000	and I felt very allergic.
4241000	4243000	But there was a episode
4243000	4245000	about the clinical trial
4245000	4247000	and IRB.
4247000	4249000	I don't think it's right.
4249000	4251000	I really want to oppose it.
4251000	4253000	So I want to join this team
4253000	4255000	and discuss with you.
4255000	4257000	Yeah.
4257000	4259000	It's politically correct.
4261000	4263000	Yeah.
4263000	4265000	Whether it's an article
4265000	4267000	or a podcast,
4267000	4269000	we welcome people
4269000	4271000	to make mistakes.
4271000	4273000	We don't always
4273000	4275000	present our expertise.
4275000	4277000	So it might be wrong.
4277000	4279000	If people are willing
4279000	4281000	to make mistakes,
4281000	4283000	it's a discussion.
4283000	4285000	I think it's good.
4285000	4287000	I think science should be like this.
4287000	4289000	You present it
4289000	4291000	and we challenge it.
4291000	4293000	We present different opinions.
4299000	4301000	I agree with what you said.
4301000	4303000	I remember
4303000	4305000	listening to
4305000	4307000	the podcast
4307000	4309000	about how to choose a boss.
4309000	4311000	I'm very similar to Sinda.
4313000	4315000	It's like
4315000	4317000	a PhD student
4317000	4319000	or someone who
4319000	4321000	used to be a PhD student
4321000	4323000	will have
4323000	4325000	an interest
4325000	4327000	in listening.
4329000	4331000	If you think of
4331000	4333000	a topic you want to listen to,
4333000	4335000	you can throw it away.
4335000	4337000	Or you can join
4337000	4339000	our PhD chat.
4339000	4341000	I have a lot of
4341000	4343000	Facebook fans
4343000	4345000	who comment
4345000	4347000	on the topics
4347000	4349000	they want to hear.
4349000	4351000	We listen to them
4351000	4353000	and discuss them.
4353000	4355000	If you have
4355000	4357000	any ideas
4357000	4359000	or topics
4359000	4361000	you think
4361000	4363000	are worth discussing,
4363000	4365000	you're welcome.
4365000	4367000	You can also
4367000	4369000	ask questions
4369000	4371000	about your daily life.
4371000	4373000	For example,
4373000	4375000	what is sashimi?
4375000	4377000	Why can it be eaten raw?
4377000	4379000	Or what is cooked meat?
4379000	4381000	They can just throw it away
4381000	4383000	and we can
4383000	4385000	make food science for them.
4387000	4389000	Sounds great.
4393000	4395000	I have some
4395000	4397000	questions.
4397000	4399000	How do you manage the platform?
4399000	4401000	It sounds like
4401000	4403000	your audience
4403000	4405000	is the general public.
4405000	4407000	But sometimes
4407000	4409000	when it comes to
4409000	4411000	PhD topics,
4411000	4413000	it feels like
4413000	4415000	you have to be a PhD student
4415000	4417000	to want to listen.
4417000	4419000	This audience
4419000	4421000	looks like a PhD student.
4421000	4423000	How do you decide
4423000	4425000	in the middle?
4425000	4427000	For example,
4427000	4429000	what kind of audience
4429000	4431000	do you have?
4431000	4433000	Do you have a balance?
4433000	4435000	I'd like to know how you manage it.
4435000	4437000	The podcast part?
4437000	4439000	Allen, do you want to answer?
4441000	4443000	I was just kidding.
4443000	4445000	Please go ahead.
4447000	4449000	No, I'm just stressed
4449000	4451000	and bored.
4451000	4453000	You can continue.
4453000	4455000	We're all funny.
4455000	4457000	No, I'm just kidding.
4459000	4461000	For the podcast part,
4461000	4463000	we're quite
4463000	4465000	familiar with
4465000	4467000	the team.
4467000	4469000	We have a LINE group.
4469000	4471000	Every week,
4471000	4473000	once a month,
4473000	4475000	I'll organize the recording schedule.
4475000	4477000	For example,
4477000	4479000	we'll decide what to record
4479000	4481000	on a certain weekend.
4481000	4483000	We'll decide the topic
4483000	4485000	we want to talk about.
4485000	4487000	It's very simple.
4487000	4489000	For example, food science.
4489000	4491000	We'll throw the food on the table
4491000	4493000	and cook it into meat.
4493000	4495000	Or, for example,
4495000	4497000	we want to talk about
4497000	4499000	academic ghost stories.
4499000	4501000	We'll think about it.
4501000	4503000	Then,
4503000	4505000	during the recording session,
4505000	4507000	we'll have a chat
4507000	4509000	and talk freely.
4509000	4511000	We'll say what we want
4511000	4513000	to talk about.
4513000	4515000	Sometimes, the recording session
4515000	4517000	takes a long time.
4517000	4519000	But it's okay.
4519000	4521000	We can edit it.
4523000	4525000	For the audience,
4525000	4527000	we don't have a specific
4527000	4529000	target audience.
4529000	4531000	But I have
4531000	4533000	a separate target audience
4533000	4535000	for each topic.
4535000	4537000	For example,
4537000	4539000	for food science,
4539000	4541000	I'll talk about science.
4541000	4543000	For doctoral studies,
4543000	4545000	I'll talk about
4545000	4547000	those who are on the path
4547000	4549000	to become a doctor.
4549000	4551000	Or those who are already
4551000	4553000	on the path to become a doctor.
4553000	4555000	And so on.
4555000	4557000	For the gym,
4557000	4559000	I'll talk about
4559000	4561000	those who are
4561000	4563000	studying science.
4563000	4565000	Scientists
4565000	4567000	don't have much time to exercise.
4567000	4569000	But Adam will
4569000	4571000	tell everyone to exercise.
4571000	4573000	So, listen to Adam's lecture
4573000	4575000	once a month.
4575000	4577000	He'll tell you to exercise
4577000	4579000	for at least two or three days.
4579000	4581000	Just like me.
4583000	4585000	So, we'll use the theme
4585000	4587000	to distinguish our audience.
4587000	4589000	What do you think,
4589000	4591000	editors?
4591000	4593000	I really
4593000	4595000	don't care about
4595000	4597000	these things.
4597000	4599000	I joined the team
4599000	4601000	because I wanted to
4601000	4603000	be a rock band.
4603000	4605000	I was very happy
4605000	4607000	to join the team.
4607000	4609000	I've learned a lot.
4609000	4611000	We're all from different backgrounds.
4611000	4613000	So, for management,
4613000	4615000	I'm the leader.
4615000	4617000	For example,
4617000	4619000	Adam, Xiao Ji,
4619000	4621000	they all run
4621000	4623000	Instagram and Facebook.
4623000	4625000	So, they really
4625000	4627000	know
4627000	4629000	the behind-the-scenes
4629000	4631000	of the team.
4631000	4633000	Xiao Ji is amazing.
4633000	4635000	She's the big manager
4635000	4637000	of our Instagram.
4639000	4641000	I've been lost lately.
4641000	4643000	I'm addicted to mobile games.
4643000	4645000	Are you still playing
4645000	4647000	the mobile game?
4647000	4649000	Yes, I am.
4649000	4651000	We have to be scientific.
4651000	4653000	I've been wondering
4653000	4655000	if anyone is still playing
4655000	4657000	the mobile game.
4659000	4661000	Xiao Ji said so,
4661000	4663000	but our Instagram
4663000	4665000	has almost 1,000 followers.
4665000	4667000	It's been a long time.
4667000	4669000	If I'm still playing,
4669000	4671000	I should have 1,000 followers
4671000	4673000	last month.
4673000	4675000	I've been working lately,
4675000	4677000	so I don't have much time.
4677000	4679000	Otherwise, we would have 5,000 followers.
4681000	4683000	At first,
4683000	4685000	some people said
4685000	4687000	their social media
4687000	4689000	would explode
4689000	4691000	and 50 people would die.
4691000	4693000	We can't join.
4693000	4695000	We don't need to buy
4695000	4697000	anything.
4697000	4699000	Only 10 people will come.
4700000	4702000	I'm sorry.
4702000	4704000	It's a cold joke.
4704000	4706000	Before we started,
4706000	4708000	Jason told us
4708000	4710000	that Tyra's speech
4710000	4712000	would explode
4712000	4714000	sometimes.
4714000	4716000	But we haven't
4716000	4718000	encountered such a situation.
4720000	4722000	I saw a few viewers
4722000	4724000	turn on the camera.
4724000	4726000	Do you want to ask questions?
4727000	4729000	Yes.
4729000	4731000	Please ask.
4731000	4733000	Hello.
4733000	4735000	I'm a student
4735000	4737000	at Tsinghua University.
4737000	4739000	I've been writing
4739000	4741000	science fiction articles
4741000	4743000	and fan magazines.
4743000	4745000	I want to ask
4745000	4747000	if you want to write
4747000	4749000	science fiction articles
4749000	4751000	for the public,
4751000	4753000	how do you write
4753000	4755000	so that everyone can understand?
4755000	4757000	I think what I write
4757000	4759000	depends on
4759000	4761000	what you've learned.
4763000	4765000	I want to write
4765000	4767000	a story,
4767000	4769000	a fable.
4769000	4771000	You don't need
4771000	4773000	to feel burdened
4773000	4775000	to read it.
4775000	4777000	If you don't like science,
4777000	4779000	you'll want to read it.
4779000	4781000	What's your topic?
4781000	4783000	Which field do you prefer?
4785000	4787000	Animal behavior and neuroscience.
4789000	4791000	That's so cool.
4791000	4793000	I want to read your fable.
4793000	4795000	I can't write it yet.
4797000	4799000	I think this topic
4799000	4801000	is easy to use.
4801000	4803000	I think we can send
4803000	4805000	CS and V to read it.
4807000	4809000	I'm neuroscience too.
4809000	4811000	Don't ignore me.
4811000	4813000	Xiao Ji is also
4813000	4815000	neuroscience.
4815000	4817000	I write more
4817000	4819000	in writing
4819000	4821000	than other editors.
4821000	4823000	But other editors
4823000	4825000	also have free time.
4825000	4827000	How to
4827000	4829000	make a science fiction
4829000	4831000	story more vivid?
4831000	4833000	Can everyone
4833000	4835000	say something bad about someone else?
4835000	4837000	We're recording.
4837000	4839000	Let's cut it out.
4839000	4841000	We can't add anything.
4843000	4845000	Don't add anything.
4847000	4849000	We're not
4849000	4851000	doing a journal club.
4851000	4853000	If we want to present
4853000	4855000	an article to the general public,
4855000	4857000	the best way
4857000	4859000	is to use as many metaphors
4859000	4861000	as possible.
4861000	4863000	Use all kinds of metaphors
4863000	4865000	in everyday life.
4865000	4867000	You've already written a fable.
4867000	4869000	That's a good metaphor.
4871000	4873000	But sometimes
4873000	4875000	when I'm reading a story,
4875000	4877000	sometimes I can't
4877000	4879000	connect with
4879000	4881000	what I want to convey.
4881000	4883000	You have to be smart
4883000	4885000	to read the meaning of
4885000	4887000	self-discipline.
4887000	4889000	I can't read poetry.
4889000	4891000	It's useless
4891000	4893000	to write poetry.
4893000	4895000	So I think
4895000	4897000	you can use
4897000	4899000	metaphors in everyday life
4899000	4901000	to describe
4901000	4903000	the scientific facts.
4905000	4907000	For example,
4907000	4909000	DNA and RNA
4909000	4911000	will go through
4911000	4913000	translation and transcription.
4913000	4915000	You can say
4915000	4917000	it's a translation of the past.
4917000	4919000	There are too many
4919000	4921000	metaphors.
4921000	4923000	You can say
4923000	4925000	it's a dictionary.
4925000	4927000	You can say
4927000	4929000	it's a code.
4929000	4931000	You can say
4931000	4933000	it's a protein.
4933000	4935000	You can use
4935000	4937000	all kinds of metaphors.
4937000	4939000	Because you're writing
4939000	4941000	about a field
4941000	4943000	that few people write about,
4943000	4945000	you can use
4945000	4947000	innovative metaphors.
4947000	4949000	What do you think, Xiao-jin?
4949000	4951000	You sound like a writer.
4953000	4955000	I used to be a writer.
4955000	4957000	Maybe until I was 80.
4959000	4961000	I think
4961000	4963000	you can use
4963000	4965000	metaphors
4965000	4967000	like Xiao-jin said.
4967000	4969000	We have a lot of metaphors.
4969000	4971000	The second thing I think
4971000	4973000	is that you can
4973000	4975000	use images.
4975000	4977000	Xiao-jin is good at
4977000	4979000	animal behavior.
4979000	4981000	It's really interesting.
4981000	4983000	He said
4983000	4985000	animal behavior is like
4985000	4987000	two
4987000	4989000	ships
4989000	4991000	mating.
4991000	4993000	When mating,
4993000	4995000	the third mate
4995000	4997000	opened his hand.
4997000	4999000	You might think
4999000	5001000	it's boring.
5001000	5003000	When we observe
5003000	5005000	animals, it's boring.
5005000	5007000	When mating,
5007000	5009000	the third mate
5009000	5011000	might react in a bad way.
5011000	5013000	It's boring.
5013000	5015000	But if you think about it,
5015000	5017000	it's like a couple
5017000	5019000	fighting in the park.
5019000	5021000	They fought.
5021000	5023000	I told you to buy soy sauce,
5023000	5025000	but you went out to date.
5025000	5027000	When you use images,
5027000	5029000	it becomes interesting.
5029000	5031000	Everyone can imagine it.
5031000	5033000	Everyone can understand
5033000	5035000	what's going on.
5035000	5037000	When you bring it up,
5037000	5039000	you can talk about
5039000	5041000	what we see in biology.
5041000	5043000	It's interesting
5043000	5045000	and you learn something.
5045000	5047000	It's cool to share with others.
5049000	5051000	I think Xiao-jin is good
5051000	5053000	at using metaphors.
5053000	5055000	I run
5055000	5057000	Sky's Instagram.
5057000	5059000	Many readers leave comments
5059000	5061000	on Instagram.
5061000	5063000	They say,
5063000	5065000	they've never thought
5065000	5067000	they'd understand biology
5067000	5069000	or science.
5069000	5071000	But it's so funny.
5071000	5073000	After laughing,
5073000	5075000	I realized I understood.
5075000	5077000	It's touching.
5077000	5079000	It's like
5079000	5081000	a virtual science.
5081000	5083000	It's like
5083000	5085000	electrons,
5085000	5087000	atoms,
5087000	5089000	and positrons.
5089000	5091000	It's like chemistry.
5091000	5093000	It has to be perfect.
5093000	5095000	When there's a free machine,
5095000	5097000	it's like
5097000	5099000	when there's only one electron,
5099000	5101000	no one holds hands,
5101000	5103000	it becomes a mountain.
5103000	5105000	It destroys
5105000	5107000	your DNA.
5107000	5109000	It's a good example.
5109000	5111000	A free machine is a mountain.
5111000	5113000	A mountain will destroy a family.
5113000	5115000	A free machine will destroy
5115000	5117000	my body.
5117000	5119000	It's similar to
5119000	5121000	life.
5121000	5123000	It's far from the past.
5123000	5125000	But it's a strong example.
5125000	5127000	I think many people
5127000	5129000	can understand and catch up.
5129000	5131000	Yes.
5131000	5133000	This way
5133000	5135000	can be trained
5135000	5137000	in daily life.
5137000	5139000	Yesterday,
5139000	5141000	when we were in the LINE group,
5141000	5143000	we attended
5143000	5145000	Tara's speech.
5145000	5147000	It was a long speech.
5147000	5149000	I replied right away.
5149000	5151000	Of course not.
5151000	5153000	Have you ever seen a steak
5153000	5155000	only served with iron plate
5155000	5157000	and three-color beans
5157000	5159000	without steak?
5159000	5161000	Iron plate noodles.
5161000	5163000	Yes, iron plate noodles.
5163000	5165000	There's no main dish.
5165000	5167000	To be a staff member,
5167000	5169000	you have to attend an academic speech.
5169000	5171000	I told her,
5171000	5173000	we have a speech.
5173000	5175000	There are some metaphors
5175000	5177000	you can apply
5177000	5179000	and learn.
5179000	5181000	You can apply it
5181000	5183000	to your writing.
5183000	5185000	First,
5185000	5187000	visualize
5187000	5189000	something interesting.
5189000	5191000	Strengthen it.
5191000	5193000	Then,
5193000	5195000	connect your scientific knowledge.
5195000	5197000	There are some connections.
5197000	5199000	When the reader
5199000	5201000	or audience
5201000	5203000	receives a piece of information,
5203000	5205000	they will connect it.
5205000	5207000	It's easy to
5207000	5209000	form a memory.
5209000	5211000	How to strengthen the memory
5211000	5213000	is important.
5213000	5215000	My teacher was good at this.
5215000	5217000	She told me,
5217000	5219000	choosing a boss is like choosing a husband.
5219000	5221000	You have to be with him for years.
5221000	5223000	It sounds important.
5223000	5225000	She explained to me
5225000	5227000	P-Value.
5227000	5229000	We all have a P-Value
5229000	5231000	like a metaphor.
5231000	5233000	But how much
5233000	5235000	is the P-Value?
5235000	5237000	If you ask her,
5237000	5239000	she'll say,
5239000	5241000	how much is the P-Value?
5241000	5243000	P is 0.9.
5243000	5245000	It must be terrible.
5245000	5247000	If she's good at speaking,
5247000	5249000	she'll recommend it.
5249000	5251000	If the noodle is good,
5251000	5253000	you must try it.
5253000	5255000	It must be good.
5255000	5257000	It's different.
5257000	5259000	It's different from others.
5259000	5261000	When she said it, I understood.
5261000	5263000	It's not necessarily right.
5263000	5265000	It's right if you follow her.
5265000	5267000	That's a great metaphor.
5267000	5269000	Everyone said
5269000	5271000	a P-Value at the end.
5271000	5273000	You know it very well.
5273000	5275000	You can remember it.
5275000	5277000	You can remember it.
5277000	5279000	Cool.
5279000	5281000	I want to read your article.
5281000	5283000	Do you post it on Facebook?
5283000	5285000	Or blog?
5285000	5287000	I'll put it on the wall
5287000	5289000	and post it
5289000	5291000	on Facebook.
5291000	5293000	What's it called?
5293000	5295000	V-Side is
5295000	5297000	the fan page of
5297000	5299000	Nervous Pig Tail.
5299000	5301000	She left a message.
5301000	5303000	It's Wen Qing Guan.
5305000	5307000	Yes, it's Wen Qing Guan.
5307000	5309000	V-Side is
5309000	5311000	like Tang Feng.
5311000	5313000	Anyone can be called.
5313000	5315000	Tang Feng likes us.
5319000	5321000	Can you share
5321000	5323000	where you
5323000	5325000	share your articles?
5325000	5327000	Chen Zhen You.
5329000	5331000	I...
5331000	5333000	I share it
5333000	5335000	on Facebook.
5335000	5337000	I post it
5337000	5339000	on my fan page
5339000	5341000	and post it
5341000	5343000	on Nervous Pig Tail
5343000	5345000	and
5345000	5347000	V-Side.
5347000	5349000	Mainly these two.
5349000	5351000	Can you post your fan page?
5351000	5353000	Can I?
5353000	5355000	Sure.
5355000	5357000	We're a
5357000	5359000	promotion platform.
5359000	5361000	If you want to promote something,
5361000	5363000	you can post your link.
5363000	5365000	Tell us your name.
5365000	5367000	Let's make a circle.
5367000	5369000	My brain has a mouth.
5371000	5373000	I think I've seen it.
5373000	5375000	Is it a mouth?
5375000	5377000	I thought it was a crime.
5379000	5381000	Is it Wen Qing?
5383000	5385000	That's too Wen Qing.
5385000	5387000	My brain is a original crime.
5391000	5393000	I have a like.
5395000	5397000	Cool.
5397000	5399000	When the fans recognize you,
5399000	5401000	they'll scream.
5409000	5411000	I want to ask
5411000	5413000	a similar question.
5413000	5415000	Chen Zhen You asked
5415000	5417000	how to
5417000	5419000	attract readers
5419000	5421000	in writing.
5421000	5423000	I want to ask
5423000	5425000	how to
5425000	5427000	attract readers
5427000	5429000	in writing.
5429000	5431000	I want to share
5433000	5435000	what you want to convey
5435000	5437000	as a scientist.
5437000	5439000	This is the problem
5439000	5441000	I'm facing.
5441000	5443000	When I meet someone
5443000	5445000	or want to flirt,
5445000	5447000	you can say
5447000	5449000	I'm not good at it.
5449000	5451000	It's normal.
5451000	5453000	You can describe
5453000	5455000	you're a physicist
5455000	5457000	or a physicist.
5457000	5459000	I'm a laser scientist.
5459000	5461000	I study light.
5461000	5463000	They'll say you're so smart.
5463000	5465000	Their mind
5465000	5467000	will be strong.
5467000	5469000	Don't tell me
5469000	5471000	your major.
5471000	5473000	You can feel
5473000	5475000	the wall.
5475000	5477000	You can't communicate.
5477000	5479000	I want to know...
5479000	5481000	Is your brain like this?
5485000	5487000	My wife is interested
5487000	5489000	in my research.
5489000	5491000	Wait, you have a wife?
5491000	5493000	I want my wife
5493000	5495000	to be interested.
5495000	5497000	His wife is his wife.
5503000	5505000	I want to know
5505000	5507000	if there's a way
5507000	5509000	to successfully
5509000	5511000	make
5511000	5513000	the other person
5513000	5515000	convey
5515000	5517000	what we learned
5517000	5519000	in science.
5519000	5521000	Is your goal
5521000	5523000	to talk about science?
5523000	5525000	Or is your goal...
5527000	5529000	I think
5529000	5531000	this is related
5531000	5533000	to your audience.
5533000	5535000	You can ask
5535000	5537000	other editors.
5537000	5539000	I think
5539000	5541000	my goal is
5541000	5543000	to convey
5543000	5545000	what I learned
5545000	5547000	to other people
5547000	5549000	with the money
5549000	5551000	I got from
5551000	5553000	the Nazis.
5553000	5555000	Tell your wife?
5555000	5557000	At least my wife
5557000	5559000	should know.
5559000	5561000	Or people
5561000	5563000	I meet.
5563000	5565000	I want to share
5565000	5567000	something.
5567000	5569000	My research
5569000	5571000	focuses on the elderly.
5571000	5573000	They have
5573000	5575000	an impression
5575000	5577000	that they're stubborn.
5577000	5579000	We have a technique
5579000	5581000	called
5581000	5583000	motivation interviewing.
5583000	5585000	You can't
5585000	5587000	directly...
5587000	5589000	If your audience
5589000	5591000	doesn't want to hear you
5591000	5593000	say something,
5593000	5595000	don't say it
5595000	5597000	directly.
5597000	5599000	CS shared
5599000	5601000	that you have to
5601000	5603000	connect to your topic
5603000	5605000	from their perspective.
5605000	5607000	You have to be related
5607000	5609000	to them
5609000	5611000	before they're interested.
5611000	5613000	Otherwise,
5613000	5615000	it's irrelevant
5615000	5617000	to them.
5617000	5619000	So,
5619000	5621000	it depends on
5621000	5623000	your language,
5623000	5625000	your attitude,
5625000	5627000	and your usage.
5627000	5629000	If you're talking to your wife,
5629000	5631000	you can
5631000	5633000	act cute.
5633000	5635000	You can tell her
5635000	5637000	that you want to share
5637000	5639000	your research
5639000	5641000	with her.
5641000	5643000	You're the one
5643000	5645000	I want to share
5645000	5647000	with her.
5647000	5649000	If you're just a passer-by,
5649000	5651000	you can
5651000	5653000	ask her about her background
5653000	5655000	first.
5655000	5657000	What's the connection
5657000	5659000	between your research and her background?
5659000	5661000	You can discuss it.
5661000	5663000	Sometimes, you have to
5663000	5665000	be interested in
5665000	5667000	the other person.
5667000	5669000	You have to be interested
5669000	5671000	in their background story
5671000	5673000	so that the conversation
5673000	5675000	can go on.
5675000	5677000	Do other editors
5677000	5679000	have their own
5679000	5681000	techniques or ideas?
5681000	5683000	Yes.
5683000	5685000	I think it's a good technique.
5685000	5687000	You can
5687000	5689000	ask the subject
5689000	5691000	about the field
5691000	5693000	they're interested in
5693000	5695000	and see if there's
5695000	5697000	a connection between
5697000	5699000	their science.
5699000	5701000	You can let them know
5701000	5703000	what they're interested in.
5703000	5705000	From a scientific point of view,
5705000	5707000	they can learn
5707000	5709000	about this field.
5709000	5711000	For example, my partner
5711000	5713000	likes Hermes a lot.
5713000	5715000	She likes the bag.
5715000	5717000	Do you know the difference
5717000	5719000	between Hermes' alligator
5719000	5721000	and the crocodile?
5721000	5723000	It's not the same.
5723000	5725000	The animal patterns
5725000	5727000	on the bag
5727000	5729000	are determined
5729000	5731000	by the genes.
5731000	5733000	You can connect
5733000	5735000	the fashion items
5735000	5737000	she likes
5737000	5739000	to the animal genes.
5739000	5741000	She'll understand
5741000	5743000	why there's a color
5743000	5745000	or a pattern on the bag.
5745000	5747000	Or she'll understand
5747000	5749000	the distribution of
5749000	5751000	the animals' origins
5751000	5753000	in different regions.
5753000	5755000	You can use it like this.
5755000	5757000	I think it sounds
5757000	5759000	interesting.
5759000	5761000	I'll give it a try.
5763000	5765000	Or you can
5765000	5767000	use a popular
5767000	5769000	catchphrase.
5769000	5771000	It's a scientific catchphrase.
5771000	5773000	Like,
5773000	5775000	I'm willing to
5775000	5777000	treat you like a red blood cell.
5777000	5779000	Your love is my oxygen.
5779000	5781000	For your love,
5781000	5783000	I don't even need my heart.
5783000	5785000	Red blood cells don't have cells.
5785000	5787000	It's the opposite.
5787000	5789000	You can tell her,
5789000	5791000	honey,
5791000	5793000	even if we're
5793000	5795000	the same age...
5795000	5797000	Honey, I'll treat your love
5797000	5799000	as if we're the same age.
5799000	5801000	We'll never be apart.
5801000	5803000	We're inseparable.
5803000	5805000	She'll ask,
5805000	5807000	don't you know?
5807000	5809000	These two things
5809000	5811000	are different, but we can't
5811000	5813000	separate them.
5813000	5815000	It's like us.
5815000	5817000	It's a scientific fact.
5817000	5819000	But you link it
5819000	5821000	to something interesting.
5821000	5823000	I think a lot of things in science
5823000	5825000	are romantic.
5825000	5827000	Like receptors.
5827000	5829000	I can only connect to you.
5829000	5831000	I can't connect to anyone else.
5831000	5833000	I want the virus to
5833000	5835000	take the AEC2
5835000	5837000	and connect to us.
5837000	5839000	It's painful to be
5839000	5841000	connected to the virus.
5841000	5843000	It's like being killed.
5843000	5845000	You said we can be separated.
5845000	5847000	Xiao Jing, you're being spied on.
5847000	5849000	What?
5849000	5851000	You're being spied on.
5851000	5853000	It's okay.
5853000	5855000	We don't need to get married
5855000	5857000	to the virus.
5857000	5859000	Who was talking just now?
5859000	5861000	Dou Dou.
5861000	5863000	Dou Dou is our immune specialist.
5863000	5865000	So,
5865000	5867000	if we talk about immune stuff today,
5867000	5869000	I'll get infected.
5869000	5871000	I was going to say
5871000	5873000	you were talking about being poisoned.
5873000	5875000	It's not like you'll
5875000	5877000	tell him you're poisoned.
5877000	5879000	It's just a possibility.
5879000	5881000	I'll be more aggressive.
5881000	5883000	When he's in pain,
5883000	5885000	I'll say,
5885000	5887000	you might not be poisoned,
5887000	5889000	but it's a possibility.
5889000	5891000	Please call an ambulance for me.
5891000	5893000	I'm not trying to solve his problem.
5893000	5895000	I'm just being a scientist.
5895000	5897000	I agree.
5897000	5899000	That's a good question.
5899000	5901000	I don't think I'll
5901000	5903000	really talk to
5903000	5905000	the general public
5905000	5907000	or people who don't
5907000	5909000	study science that much.
5909000	5911000	Yeah.
5911000	5913000	I just heard
5913000	5915000	Shilan say
5915000	5917000	you're doing research on physics.
5917000	5919000	That's really...
5919000	5921000	Is that how you say it?
5921000	5923000	I think
5923000	5925000	it's harder to...
5925000	5927000	That's a weird way to say it.
5927000	5929000	You're the one who thinks it's weird.
5929000	5931000	People think
5931000	5933000	what we do is deep.
5933000	5935000	What we do is...
5935000	5937000	It's just a lab.
5937000	5939000	It's just
5939000	5941000	putting together
5941000	5943000	capacitors and capacitors.
5943000	5945000	You're a welder
5945000	5947000	and a water pipe connector.
5947000	5949000	You connect all kinds of things.
5949000	5951000	That's all you do every day.
5951000	5953000	It's not as complicated
5953000	5955000	as people think.
5955000	5957000	I think it's complicated.
5957000	5959000	I think it's complicated, too.
5959000	5961000	Yeah.
5961000	5963000	I think it's because your field
5963000	5965000	sounds complicated.
5965000	5967000	You have to start with
5967000	5969000	simple things.
5969000	5971000	For example,
5971000	5973000	when I talk to people,
5973000	5975000	I'm afraid to answer
5975000	5977000	when people ask me about my background.
5977000	5979000	When I first came to Italy,
5979000	5981000	I wanted to make friends,
5981000	5983000	so I talked to people about
5983000	5985000	my background,
5985000	5987000	and they were like,
5987000	5989000	oh, I see.
5989000	5991000	That's usually the case.
5991000	5993000	That's usually the case.
5993000	5995000	When you're at a friend's party,
5995000	5997000	people ask you,
5997000	5999000	what do you do?
5999000	6001000	You answer, I do physics.
6001000	6003000	Then people start to change the subject.
6003000	6005000	So you have to be prepared.
6005000	6007000	Like the welder
6007000	6009000	you mentioned earlier.
6009000	6011000	He's a good guy.
6011000	6013000	It's not that it's difficult
6013000	6015000	when you hear physics,
6015000	6017000	but we're like welders.
6017000	6019000	We're all welding.
6019000	6021000	I'll answer,
6021000	6023000	it's not that it's difficult,
6023000	6025000	but I use my computer to analyze.
6025000	6027000	I'm just a nerd.
6027000	6029000	I'm a nerd.
6029000	6031000	I'm a nerd.
6031000	6033000	I'm a nerd.
6033000	6035000	I'm a nerd.
6035000	6037000	I'm a nerd.
6037000	6039000	I'm a nerd.
6039000	6041000	This know-how,
6041000	6043000	do you have any questions?
6045000	6047000	You're welcome.
6047000	6049000	You can ask all kinds of questions.
6049000	6051000	Yeah, because podcast
6051000	6053000	is about all kinds of things.
6053000	6055000	It's not like we'll answer
6055000	6057000	all the right questions.
6057000	6059000	If you listen to our podcast,
6059000	6061000	you'll know that every time something comes up,
6061000	6063000	we all have different opinions.
6063000	6065000	It's a discussion.
6065000	6067000	Wang Yiting.
6067000	6069000	I don't know how to pronounce it.
6069000	6071000	Hi, I'm Yiting.
6071000	6073000	I'm a part of today's speaker.
6073000	6075000	I'm happy to be here
6075000	6077000	to teach everyone.
6077000	6079000	Is it Yiting?
6079000	6081000	Yes, that's me.
6083000	6085000	Yiting I met at a science activity.
6085000	6087000	Yes, that's me.
6087000	6089000	I'm just curious
6089000	6091000	that I've been
6091000	6093000	listening to everyone
6093000	6095000	from the perspective of a spectator
6095000	6097000	and thought that
6097000	6099000	everyone's background is more
6099000	6101000	in the field of natural science.
6101000	6103000	As far as I know,
6103000	6105000	my field was
6105000	6107000	traditional natural science
6107000	6109000	in medical school.
6109000	6111000	Then I slowly
6111000	6113000	got closer to social science.
6113000	6115000	For example, social science
6115000	6117000	or some other
6117000	6119000	philosophical people
6119000	6121000	might have a chance to collaborate.
6121000	6123000	Of course, I can't claim
6123000	6125000	that I'm the only one.
6125000	6127000	From the perspective of social science,
6127000	6129000	they often do
6129000	6131000	so-called knowledge promotion.
6131000	6133000	In fact,
6133000	6135000	there are a lot of
6135000	6137000	social science-related things on the market.
6137000	6139000	For example, legal white paper.
6139000	6141000	Because everyone feels
6141000	6143000	that when we hear about
6143000	6145000	the problems of natural science,
6145000	6147000	for example,
6147000	6149000	everyone is quiet.
6149000	6151000	But in fact,
6151000	6153000	they also have similar problems.
6153000	6155000	Oh, I study social science,
6155000	6157000	and everyone is quiet.
6157000	6159000	In fact, I have seen
6159000	6161000	a lot of fans
6161000	6163000	who want to do
6163000	6165000	knowledge promotion
6165000	6167000	of social science.
6167000	6169000	I want to explain
6169000	6171000	some more complicated concepts to you.
6171000	6173000	I don't know if you
6173000	6175000	have any experience
6175000	6177000	in this knowledge promotion
6177000	6179000	or so-called science promotion
6179000	6181000	that other partners have discussed.
6183000	6185000	In fact, what we want to do is similar,
6185000	6187000	but our subjects are different.
6187000	6189000	I'm just curious about your experience.
6189000	6191000	From their perspective,
6191000	6193000	how does it work?
6193000	6195000	Or when you were running
6195000	6197000	a fan page,
6197000	6199000	did you see other examples
6199000	6201000	that they did well?
6201000	6203000	I want to take this opportunity
6203000	6205000	to learn more.
6205000	6207000	Maybe I haven't revealed it yet,
6207000	6209000	but I want to share it with you.
6209000	6211000	Do you mean
6211000	6213000	social science?
6213000	6215000	Social science,
6215000	6217000	for example,
6217000	6219000	psychology.
6219000	6221000	Psychology is actually quite common,
6221000	6223000	and I often write articles about it.
6223000	6225000	Maybe economics,
6225000	6227000	society, management,
6227000	6229000	law, and politics
6229000	6231000	are all social science.
6231000	6233000	In fact,
6233000	6235000	they also have some
6235000	6237000	demands
6237000	6239000	that they want to share with the public
6239000	6241000	to let people know that
6241000	6243000	what we do professionally
6243000	6245000	is not just in our own ivory tower,
6245000	6247000	but also wants to connect
6247000	6249000	with everyone's daily life.
6249000	6251000	I think they may also be looking for
6251000	6253000	a place for them to cut in.
6253000	6255000	As you said,
6255000	6257000	I can't think of
6257000	6259000	anything other than
6259000	6261000	legal dialogues.
6261000	6263000	But I know
6263000	6265000	there's a lot of
6265000	6267000	cultural knowledge
6267000	6269000	in the show.
6269000	6271000	For example,
6271000	6273000	linguistics.
6273000	6275000	I'm actually
6275000	6277000	inviting a linguist
6277000	6279000	to be the host of
6279000	6281000	Knowledge is Fun.
6281000	6283000	I hope he'll accept our interview.
6283000	6285000	Knowledge is Fun is a podcast
6285000	6287000	about culture and listening.
6287000	6289000	They also
6289000	6291000	worked with
6291000	6293000	the New York Times.
6293000	6295000	It's more natural science.
6295000	6297000	They have a series of
6297000	6299000	Knowledge is Fun,
6299000	6301000	including linguistics,
6301000	6303000	criminal psychology,
6303000	6305000	and so on.
6309000	6311000	Philosophy is also fun.
6311000	6313000	They also do some sharing.
6313000	6315000	What was the name
6315000	6317000	of the show before?
6317000	6319000	Philosophy, Philosophy, Egg Cake.
6319000	6321000	They do
6321000	6323000	a lot of philosophy.
6323000	6325000	I don't know much
6325000	6327000	about sociology.
6327000	6329000	But Lawyer Lv is good.
6329000	6331000	He talks a lot
6331000	6333000	about everything.
6335000	6337000	Do you have
6337000	6339000	any comments
6339000	6341000	or thoughts
6341000	6343000	you'd like to share?
6343000	6345000	I like the story.
6345000	6347000	I think it's
6347000	6349000	about history.
6349000	6351000	Yes.
6351000	6353000	It's so good.
6353000	6355000	You can see it on iQIYI.
6355000	6357000	I'm still watching
6357000	6359000	on Instagram.
6359000	6361000	Unless I'm really interested,
6361000	6363000	I'll look at the text.
6363000	6365000	But I think they're good.
6365000	6367000	They write about history.
6367000	6369000	It's a story.
6369000	6371000	It's interesting.
6371000	6373000	When I was in high school,
6373000	6375000	I don't know if you've seen
6375000	6377000	what history textbooks
6377000	6379000	I wrote in high school.
6379000	6381000	Why did I write
6381000	6383000	literary textbooks in high school?
6383000	6385000	And all of my answers
6385000	6387000	were wrong.
6387000	6389000	You're revealing your age.
6389000	6391000	I'm revealing my age.
6391000	6393000	The most painful thing
6393000	6395000	was that I thought literary textbooks
6395000	6397000	had a lot of room to explain.
6397000	6399000	It's just two or three words.
6399000	6401000	I thought maybe that's what they meant.
6401000	6403000	I was like, why would you think that?
6403000	6405000	Of course, I didn't have time
6405000	6407000	to discuss this with you in class.
6407000	6409000	But I think that's the way
6409000	6411000	you should learn history.
6411000	6413000	History is what people do.
6413000	6415000	A person may have a lot of reasons
6415000	6417000	to do this.
6417000	6419000	Why must it be like this?
6419000	6421000	Today, he wrote a non-human disaster.
6421000	6423000	Was he happy to write a non-human disaster?
6423000	6425000	Did he write a non-human disaster?
6425000	6427000	Or did he think he looked ugly?
6427000	6429000	Or did he think
6429000	6431000	it was too much to
6431000	6433000	deal with?
6433000	6435000	You don't know.
6435000	6437000	Why do you only have one answer?
6437000	6439000	Do you have any
6439000	6441000	suggestions?
6441000	6443000	Are you doing
6443000	6445000	research on this?
6445000	6447000	Do you have any suggestions
6447000	6449000	for us?
6451000	6453000	Because I also
6453000	6455000	had more opportunities to
6455000	6457000	get in touch with philosophy on Friday.
6457000	6459000	I used to have
6459000	6461000	very unfamiliar discussions.
6461000	6463000	When I started participating,
6463000	6465000	I thought that
6465000	6467000	if the mainstream background
6467000	6469000	was more
6469000	6471000	natural science,
6471000	6473000	people would have a way of discussing
6473000	6475000	and speaking.
6475000	6477000	But in the mainstream of
6477000	6479000	social science,
6479000	6481000	they would also have a way of speaking.
6481000	6483000	When I first participated,
6483000	6485000	I thought it was a new experience.
6485000	6487000	But after a few times,
6487000	6489000	I realized that
6489000	6491000	many things are the same.
6491000	6493000	It's just that
6493000	6495000	how do we make
6495000	6497000	what we think is important
6497000	6499000	but may be complicated
6499000	6501000	more interesting to more people?
6501000	6503000	I don't have many
6503000	6505000	suggestions.
6505000	6507000	I just think that
6507000	6509000	the experience of
6509000	6511000	exposing each other
6511000	6513000	is helpful to me.
6513000	6515000	I may see more opportunities
6515000	6517000	to get closer to each other.
6517000	6519000	So I'm just curious
6519000	6521000	if this is a future direction
6521000	6523000	of Sky in the World.
6523000	6525000	As you just heard,
6525000	6527000	we are now in the industry
6527000	6529000	where people call each other
6529000	6531000	the wall side.
6531000	6533000	Through this way of
6533000	6535000	increasing contact,
6535000	6537000	I think it can really help us
6537000	6539000	to understand more.
6539000	6541000	In addition to wanting to
6541000	6543000	let others understand our knowledge,
6543000	6545000	I think the experience
6545000	6547000	of teaching each other
6547000	6549000	is quite useful to me.
6549000	6551000	So I'm just curious
6551000	6553000	if this is also a future direction
6553000	6555000	that everyone is interested in.
6555000	6557000	It sounds like there is.
6557000	6559000	I just want to share this.
6559000	6561000	This is not the future,
6561000	6563000	this is the progress.
6563000	6565000	In our interview,
6565000	6567000	we will invite people from
6567000	6569000	different fields.
6569000	6571000	Of course,
6571000	6573000	we will invite people
6573000	6575000	from different fields.
6575000	6577000	For example,
6577000	6579000	we have interviewed
6579000	6581000	people from education,
6581000	6583000	such as Annie,
6583000	6585000	who was our guest speaker
6585000	6587000	last time,
6587000	6589000	and Dr. Yi Yang,
6589000	6591000	who is a professor of music.
6591000	6593000	He is teaching music history
6593000	6595000	in the US.
6595000	6597000	We will also invite people
6597000	6599000	from language studies,
6599000	6601000	or even people
6601000	6603000	who are not in the scientific field.
6603000	6605000	We have also interviewed
6605000	6607000	people like Maria,
6607000	6609000	who is a Chinese bride.
6609000	6611000	We have always been
6611000	6613000	trying to get in touch
6613000	6615000	with people from different fields.
6615000	6617000	But this is not
6617000	6619000	a scientific conversation.
6619000	6621000	Our research field
6621000	6623000	is very different,
6623000	6625000	but we all have to live.
6625000	6627000	So I will put this
6627000	6629000	topic in the interview,
6629000	6631000	because the interview
6631000	6633000	may be a topic
6633000	6635000	on how to plan
6635000	6637000	your life.
6637000	6639000	So when different
6639000	6641000	life plans
6641000	6643000	are shared by people
6643000	6645000	from different fields,
6645000	6647000	there will be different sparks.
6647000	6649000	Because we all have to live,
6649000	6651000	but we don't have to be
6651000	6653000	scientific.
6653000	6655000	So we use this sense of community
6655000	6657000	in our interviews.
6659000	6661000	I hope I have answered your question.
6661000	6663000	You mentioned that
6663000	6665000	if you want to join
6665000	6667000	the self-media
6667000	6669000	or spread the message,
6669000	6671000	the threshold is very low.
6671000	6673000	For example,
6673000	6675000	if we want to do a podcast,
6675000	6677000	we only need a computer
6677000	6679000	and a cell phone.
6679000	6681000	So we don't need
6681000	6683000	any equipment
6683000	6685000	The only difficulty
6685000	6687000	is the adjustment
6687000	6689000	in time.
6689000	6691000	That's because our team is big.
6691000	6693000	Sorry, our team is a bit big.
6693000	6695000	We need to adjust.
6695000	6697000	But if
6697000	6699000	we are a single person,
6699000	6701000	we have heard
6701000	6703000	that the podcast is a single person.
6703000	6705000	So if you are a person
6705000	6707000	and I want to share something with everyone,
6707000	6709000	you can.
6709000	6711000	I just thought that
6711000	6713000	if you are a college student
6713000	6715000	in the architecture department,
6715000	6717000	they also have their own podcast.
6717000	6719000	I forgot the name.
6719000	6721000	If you want to know,
6721000	6723000	you can find out.
6723000	6725000	I just want to say
6725000	6727000	hi to everyone.
6729000	6731000	You can communicate with Alan.
6731000	6733000	We are good friends.
6733000	6735000	We have a LINE group.
6735000	6737000	We talk every day.
6737000	6739000	We talk a lot every day.
6741000	6743000	I think
6743000	6745000	this is a very good direction.
6745000	6747000	Because we really
6747000	6749000	lack
6749000	6751000	certain types of scholars.
6751000	6753000	We lack a lot.
6753000	6755000	The physicist, please
6755000	6757000	agree to our interview.
6757000	6759000	Otherwise, we won't let you off the hook.
6759000	6761000	This is his.
6765000	6767000	Sorry.
6767000	6769000	You should
6769000	6771000	invite him to
6771000	6773000	an interview.
6773000	6775000	Let's help him discuss
6775000	6777000	how to chat with his wife.
6777000	6779000	After the interview,
6779000	6781000	we will let his wife listen to it.
6781000	6783000	It's very interesting.
6787000	6789000	It's very interesting.
6789000	6791000	But our audience
6791000	6793000	has a question.
6793000	6795000	Let's let the audience ask first.
6795000	6797000	I want to ask
6797000	6799000	have you ever thought
6799000	6801000	to promote your podcast
6801000	6803000	to high school or even high school?
6803000	6805000	Because you have a lot of skills.
6805000	6807000	Like protein
6807000	6809000	or bacteria.
6809000	6811000	Those skills
6811000	6813000	made me think
6813000	6815000	this is my high school knowledge.
6815000	6817000	If the school taught like this at that time,
6817000	6819000	it might
6819000	6821000	be more interesting.
6821000	6823000	I think
6823000	6825000	this channel is really interesting.
6825000	6827000	If I have a chance to promote
6827000	6829000	to national high school,
6829000	6831000	it might be very interesting.
6831000	6833000	Thank you.
6833000	6835000	That's a very good suggestion.
6835000	6837000	But we can't
6837000	6839000	control the audience's level.
6839000	6841000	But
6841000	6843000	I have tried my best
6843000	6845000	to find teachers
6845000	6847000	to interview.
6847000	6849000	I hope to attract
6849000	6851000	their approval.
6851000	6853000	Maybe it can be spread.
6853000	6855000	But
6855000	6857000	teaching at national high school
6857000	6859000	really needs to teach
6859000	6861000	the principles
6861000	6863000	or rules.
6865000	6867000	Because
6867000	6869000	we talk about
6869000	6871000	academic articles in the program.
6871000	6873000	So it might be
6873000	6875000	something that hasn't been decided yet.
6875000	6877000	It's possible.
6877000	6879000	So
6879000	6881000	I don't know
6881000	6883000	if I can understand
6883000	6885000	this program
6885000	6887000	without a solid basic knowledge.
6887000	6889000	I'm afraid that
6889000	6891000	they will fight with the teacher
6891000	6893000	after the Sky in the World interview.
6893000	6895000	Isn't it good?
6895000	6897000	Our education needs this kind of spark.
6897000	6899000	I think this is to convey to them
6899000	6901000	that something is not only the right answer.
6901000	6903000	Aren't these people doctors?
6903000	6905000	I think high school should
6905000	6907000	have a chance.
6907000	6909000	Because
6909000	6911000	the basic knowledge
6911000	6913000	like sugar,
6913000	6915000	or protein,
6915000	6917000	or fat,
6917000	6919000	I think they should
6919000	6921000	have a chance
6921000	6923000	to interact with the textbook.
6923000	6925000	I hope
6925000	6927000	high school students can come.
6927000	6929000	Our
6929000	6931000	Clubhouse
6931000	6933000	has a
6933000	6935000	host
6935000	6937000	twice in a row.
6937000	6939000	It's a textbook on Instagram.
6939000	6941000	It's three times in a row.
6941000	6943000	So
6943000	6945000	we hope to
6945000	6947000	get to know these people.
6951000	6953000	OK.
6953000	6955000	Thank you.
6955000	6957000	It's my first time to see you.
6957000	6959000	It's my first time to see you.
6959000	6961000	It's my first time to see you.
6961000	6963000	It's my first time to see you.
6963000	6965000	You look like
6965000	6967000	a grandpa.
6969000	6971000	My white beard.
6971000	6973000	My white beard.
6973000	6975000	Do I look like a grandpa?
6975000	6977000	Do I look like a grandpa?
6977000	6979000	Yes, your glasses.
6979000	6981000	You look like a natural
6981000	6983000	grandpa.
6983000	6985000	Mom's dad.
6987000	6989000	Adam, do you want to take off your shirt?
6989000	6991000	Or he can't recognize you.
6991000	6993000	I can recognize you.
6993000	6995000	On Instagram,
6995000	6997000	I saw Adam
6997000	6999000	showing off his muscles.
6999000	7001000	It's different from now.
7001000	7003000	It's different from now.
7003000	7005000	Too many people. I'm not shy.
7007000	7009000	OK.
7009000	7011000	Sorry to interrupt.
7015000	7017000	I want to
7017000	7019000	comment from Taira's perspective.
7019000	7021000	You mentioned
7021000	7023000	many platforms.
7023000	7025000	I don't know
7025000	7027000	about them.
7027000	7029000	I've never seen or heard of them.
7029000	7031000	I want to say
7033000	7035000	from Taira's perspective,
7035000	7037000	we might want to
7037000	7039000	collaborate with these organizations.
7039000	7041000	We can try.
7041000	7043000	I don't know
7043000	7045000	if we should
7045000	7047000	organize
7047000	7049000	a group
7049000	7051000	to talk about
7051000	7053000	science or
7053000	7055000	knowledge.
7055000	7057000	We can
7057000	7059000	write down
7059000	7061000	the links
7061000	7063000	and see
7063000	7065000	who we can collaborate with.
7065000	7067000	The second comment
7067000	7069000	is
7069000	7071000	from Taira's perspective.
7071000	7073000	We have many PhD students.
7073000	7075000	They have
7075000	7077000	very professional
7077000	7079000	background knowledge.
7079000	7081000	I think
7081000	7083000	we should
7083000	7085000	collaborate with them.
7085000	7087000	We can find people
7087000	7089000	to interview.
7089000	7091000	I think
7091000	7093000	you can see
7093000	7095000	that Taira's team
7095000	7097000	focuses on natural science.
7097000	7099000	But there are
7099000	7101000	many branches in natural science.
7101000	7103000	And
7103000	7105000	there are many
7105000	7107000	areas I've never heard of
7107000	7109000	before.
7109000	7111000	So I think
7111000	7113000	you can dig
7113000	7115000	and protect them.
7115000	7117000	You can dig for resources.
7117000	7119000	I just want to say that.
7119000	7121000	How can we find
7121000	7123000	Taira's
7123000	7125000	contacts?
7125000	7127000	Are you the window?
7127000	7129000	I want to find
7129000	7131000	Taira's contacts.
7133000	7135000	Taira has a PR team.
7135000	7137000	I think our seminar team is too busy.
7137000	7139000	We have a PR team.
7139000	7141000	Xinda has a PR team.
7141000	7143000	You are familiar with it.
7143000	7145000	Yes.
7145000	7147000	I used to be in the PR team.
7147000	7149000	Then I
7149000	7151000	became
7151000	7153000	the president.
7155000	7157000	That's it.
7157000	7159000	You can
7159000	7161000	contact us.
7161000	7163000	Maybe we can
7165000	7167000	work together.
7167000	7169000	I think it's interesting.
7169000	7171000	I have an idea.
7171000	7173000	I just thought of it.
7173000	7175000	I don't have to agree with you.
7175000	7177000	Sleep on it.
7177000	7179000	Taiwan
7179000	7181000	has interviewed
7181000	7183000	Shanae.
7183000	7185000	She is the PI
7185000	7187000	for Taiwan.
7187000	7189000	They are
7189000	7191000	doing the same thing
7191000	7193000	as us.
7193000	7195000	They are also working on
7195000	7197000	scientific communication.
7197000	7199000	They are from the UK.
7199000	7201000	They are distributed in 5 or 6 different countries.
