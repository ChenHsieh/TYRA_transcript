00:12.000 --> 00:16.640
Okay, I believe everyone can see my screen now

00:16.640 --> 00:22.000
Sorry, let me see if I can play it

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I think it's fine

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
🦋 subs by bubucaca 🦋

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Okay, I'll just...

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
I'll just use this mode

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everyone

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Today we have

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
the other two professors

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
to share

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
their thoughts

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
on the

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
requirements of

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
applying for

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
a PhD program

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Thank you

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
to the two professors

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
for coming

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
and sharing

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
their experiences

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
with us

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Thank you

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
today's topic

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
will be discussed

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
by me and Professor Chen

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Before you apply

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
for a PhD

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
what can you

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
consider

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and what information

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
can you use

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
to help you

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
decide

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
whether to

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
apply for

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
a PhD program

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
let's start

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
with the first part

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
and then

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
the second part

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and then

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Professor Chen

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Okay

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
all the

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
audience

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
are interested

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
in applying for

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
a PhD program

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
If you are

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
applying for a

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
master's program

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
or a

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
MBA

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
or any other

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
major

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
it may be

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
a little

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
different

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
So

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
let me

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
introduce myself

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
My name is

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Chen

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I am a

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
PhD student

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
and I am

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
currently studying

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
at the

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
University of

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
San Francisco

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
and I am

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
currently studying

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
at the

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
University of San Francisco

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
In the

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
US, there is

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
no salary cap

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
In the academic world

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
In Canada,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
it is more like

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
the US

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
but in many

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
European and American

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
countries

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
there is no

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
fixed salary

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
This is a

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
very important

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
part of

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
your career

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
For example,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
the vaccine against

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
COVID-19

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
is a very important

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
part of your

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
career

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I hope that

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
you can find

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
a better training

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
and a better

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
way of teaching

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I hope that

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
you can

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
learn about leadership

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
In addition to teaching

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
and research, you can

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
develop your own

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
career

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I hope that

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
you can

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
develop your own

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
career

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I hope that

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
you can

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
develop your own

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
career

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Thank you

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm going to let them know

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We're about to start

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Is it this one?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Yes

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay, so tell me if you still have a problem

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Anyway, I hope I made myself clear

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
The point is, this is a soft voice

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Can you follow me?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Yes

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Another one

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Future direction

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Future direction

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's start with this

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
What can you do in the future?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm talking about social science

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
In social science, of course, you can go a long way

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Social science is, of course

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Except for academic position

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
For example, research university

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Research type R1, R2

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Teaching type university

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
The so-called Boya College

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Or community college

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Some people even do tenure track

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Non-tenure track job

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Or even in college

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Some are research jobs

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Not so-called teaching

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But it's a pure research job

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Some term faculty

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Not tenure track

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
In Taiwan

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
The concept of so-called professional assistant

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Or there is a visiting professor

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Visiting students

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
This teacher is also relatively

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Temporary

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Actual position

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's more like Taiwan's part-time

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Teaching one or two classes

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
There is a part-time job in the academic world

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Of course there are more

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
But I'm roughly like this

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
There are also other people who want to say

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I don't want to do academic work

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Some of my students say

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm not interested in pure academic work

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
But I hope to change the world

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Or I hope to be able to

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They may go to the library

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Some students or friends

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Work in government agencies

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Whether it's the local government or the federal government

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Like me

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
National Institute of Justice

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
FBI

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Or local police

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Of course this part

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It depends on your identity

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Especially in the United States

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
For government work

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
A lot of people ask

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You are at least a green card or a citizen

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
This is a way out

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Of course there are some non-research institutions

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Or some organizations

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
For example, some people want to go

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
For example, criminal protection

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Related organizations

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Or even anti-human trafficking

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Anti-population transmission

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Like I have a lot of students

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
In some different agencies

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
But there is one thing

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I want to talk about

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So much good

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
But also consider

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Sometimes looking for a job after graduation

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Get a doctor's degree

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Does it help you find a job?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
This thing

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It's not necessarily

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Why do you say that

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
You may have to look at your future work

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Standards for the degree you need

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Sometimes people work

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Especially if you are not in the academic world

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
If you work in the industry

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
They are also worried about one thing

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Overqualification

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You have a doctor's degree

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But they only need a master's degree

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
At least in Europe and the United States

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Sometimes they don't want you to have a master's degree

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
To find a job

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Because on the one hand

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It's a part of the salary

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
On the other hand

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I think it's a waste of money

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
So maybe you can think about it first

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
What is your future career outlook

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And then think about it

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This is the way to go

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Is it the most suitable way for you

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
So now

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Is Powerpoint moving?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I have it here

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
OK

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
This is what I said before

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
When I was talking to Professor Chen

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
We are all curious about this

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I want to share something with you

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Sometimes you come to the doctoral class

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Before you need to think about it

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Why do you want to come to this doctoral class

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Why is this question important

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Because it's the doctoral class

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's not like the master's class

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
One or two years

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But when it comes to a doctor

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
You're looking for a job

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
People will worry about whether you will be highly educated

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And then you read the doctor

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
For you

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Some parts of the field become more open

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
But the work part

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Or some parts

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Sometimes it becomes narrower

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So you might want to think about it

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And the time and money you invest

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
You can think about it

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Why do you want to read this doctoral class

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
It's because of your family's expectations

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Your important others' expectations

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
People around you keep telling you

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You're so smart not to read

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It's a pity

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's because of other people's expectations

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Even the neighbors

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Who is so smart

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Why don't you read a doctor

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Is it because of this

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Or because you want to pursue self-fulfillment

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I just like to do research

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I think this is my mission

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Or you are very enthusiastic about a certain topic

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Like I might be a student

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Tell me when I was very young

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I think this is very important

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
This is his passion

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Then it is very clear

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Know which way you want to go

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Then this may be a

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Your internal motivation may be very important

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Or is it possible to read this

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I feel like I can do some work after reading the doctor

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It seems to be a social status

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It seems to feel like

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
The income will be very stable and high

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
But it's not like that

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Just like we said

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Although at least in the United States

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
But at the same time

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
That is to say

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
The distribution is not very uniform

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
For example, it's not the same job

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Your payout will be the same

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So you may have to think about this

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
If you come to read

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It's to feel like I'm a few years later

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Guaranteed to have a job

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Guaranteed to have a good salary

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
There is no way

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
So if it's so direct

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Or so practical

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You may consider

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Go to the way

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Go to the way you want

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Because especially now

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Everyone knows that Kobe is more serious

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
In Taiwan

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
The same job

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
A lot of people are fighting

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This is more serious in the United States

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Like last year, we hired two people

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Then we hired two people

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I seem to have received about 160 applications

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
This is for two jobs

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
So this is actually very competitive now

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
So you got a doctorate

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Guaranteed that you will definitely get a job

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
So this thing is what you have to think about

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
What is your motivation

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Why did you come to read this thing

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Some people say I don't know what to read

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Especially Taiwan

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I have read

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know what to do

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Just keep reading

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
This is also an idea

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
But maybe at some point

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Think about where your enthusiasm for the future is

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Like I said here

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
There is nothing right or wrong

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
But maybe you have to ask yourself first

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
What is your goal

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
What kind of self-achievement do you want to achieve

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Another very important thing is

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Can you accept

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Can you accept

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
If this

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Walking back and forth

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The result is not what you imagined

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Can you bear such a result

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Then these are all

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I think these can be thought of first

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Not to hit you

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Not to make everyone feel that life is very pessimistic

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But I think you can think about it first

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
If there is such a thing

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
More able to face

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
When it comes to life

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Know that this is just a process

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
This is a process

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You may always kick a little stone on the road

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
That doesn't mean

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
What will it be

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But maybe think about it first

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I know

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
If you are more determined

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I think I can overcome this

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But if you don't have a very firm idea

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I think I want to retreat

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Of course, the other part is

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
It's more practical to consider

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
What is the price you need to pay

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Time to work hard

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Your money can face the future

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Uncertainty

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
After all, there is a lot of pressure

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Can you do something good

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Can you finish reading within a certain period of time

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Then usually this test is

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
There are often some low self-esteem

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
The concept of low self-esteem

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Why do you feel

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I don't seem to read fast

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
My presentation is not good

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
My grades are not good

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's easy to become

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Such a lost comparison

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
And often there are setbacks

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Your first draft is accepted immediately

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Then everyone goes to celebrate

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
This time is too little

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
If you get R and R

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
If you can modify it

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You should put it aside

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
You get the first draft

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
You can see right away

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Is to face

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
As we said at the beginning

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Of course there are benefits

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You can learn some knowledge

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You have a lot of different life experiences

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Research experience

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Then you have some different skills

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Then your field of vision will be more open

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
You will have some ideas of cross-cultural

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Even say you can meet some very cool people

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Great master

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
You used to read in textbooks

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Maybe next to your office

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
You can talk to him about some research questions

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But we can't just talk about the good side

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Then don't talk about that

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Don't talk about some negative parts

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Jump to the next part

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I want to ask

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Do you want to add here?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
For students

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
That is to come

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That is to come

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Some of the parts I want to add

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
No, I think the teacher said very well

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Please continue

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Then I will continue to finish

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I will leave it to you

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
That is

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
If you want to play this thing

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Still feel very firm

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I want to go to the institute

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Of course the first part is

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You have to find a school

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Which school is suitable for you

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Or I said which school

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
In the institute

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Doctoral class is more specific

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
It's not the part of the school

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Which is

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Which department

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Is suitable for you

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So we will put that program

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
At the front

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I think the program should be compared to the school

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Is

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
The rank is more priority

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Because after all

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
No matter how good the school

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
For example, some schools like Harvard

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Maybe some departments are very good

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Some departments are not so good

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So it's not that the better the school, the better the department

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Then I myself

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I will put the program

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Is able to provide

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Even the ranking program content

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
At the top

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Then you have to see if this department is suitable for your field of study

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Is it possible to provide the necessary resources

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
For example

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Is there a teacher in the department

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Or the lab is special

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
In the part you want to study

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Because you have to read the doctor

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Basically there should be some

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
The field you want to understand

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
But that doesn't mean you can't change it in the future

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Cross-field or transfer field

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Because I have transferred to the field

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
But this part needs to be understood first

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
If you are very interested

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
That is to find the program

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
It's important to have a professor you want to work with

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
How to choose a good school

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Of course

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Carnegie is the

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Commission of Higher Education

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
There are R1, R2 and D

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
There are many kinds

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I only list those who can get a doctorate

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Of course the first one is

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
R1 is very high

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Respect

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Focus

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
On the research part

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Usually the teacher's teaching burden is relatively low

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Usually 1,2 or 2,2

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
One semester, one door, one semester, two doors

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
R2

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Also focus on research

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
But also focus on teaching

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
The teacher's teaching burden here is usually bigger

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But I still hope

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
The teacher can do a good job

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But this part becomes

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Because the teacher's teaching burden is slightly higher

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
So usually it can be divided into research time

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Not necessarily so much

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
D and P

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Some professional schools

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
For example

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
For example, the Department of Physical Medicine

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Or

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Not reading PhD

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Psychology

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
That's different

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
This is a more professional degree

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
But be careful

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
If you want to get a professional degree

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
A lot of times

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
They will ask you to get a PhD

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Not a professional doctor

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
There will be some differences

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Because the requirements are different

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
The evaluation method is not the same

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
When it comes to choosing a program

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
If the program is similar

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Still have to look back at the school

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Because the better the school's ranking

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
The better its resources

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It usually attracts more

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Different good students

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Overall reputation

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
It still helps you in the future

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
So when the program is similar

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Also consider the school's ranking

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Then there are some

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
When you are considering

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Like for me

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
There was a very northern school in New York

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
A very southern school in Florida

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I thought it was too cold and too hot

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
So I went to Maryland to study

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
This is for you

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Geographic location is important

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
If you think about going back to Taiwan

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's convenient

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
University is also an advantage

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Not only can you fly directly to Taiwan

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Another point is

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Do you need to work

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Easy to travel

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The convenience of travel

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Is also a consideration for you

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Cost of living

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Is your living expenses

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You have to consider

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Usually there will be scholarship

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But in a big city

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
General graduate scholarship

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
You can't afford your life

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Maybe you have to make up for some

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
But if you are in some

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Lower living expenses

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Many students I heard

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
You can still save some money

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
So cost of living is also a consideration

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Opportunity

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
For example, my students

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
In DC

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We often have some opportunities

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
We will do a state report

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Report to the members of the state

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
We are in crime prevention policy

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Research results

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
We have a better chance of getting along with them

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Or even to be an intern

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
There will be more federal agencies

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Can do internship

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Or something

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Or after graduation

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Like I have a student

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Before graduation

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Because it's close

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
So this opportunity is also the future

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
You may want to consider

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
For example, whether it is a long-term job

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Or some work experience

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Opportunity is also important

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Then there is the climate

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
If the climate is for you

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Your comfort zone is not so big

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Or you want to experience a very different life

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Maybe you will choose

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Some regions have different climates

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
The other one I want to tell you

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Usually

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You are in the doctor's class

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
If you want to find a school

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Maybe you have to do a little more homework

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Because if you only look at

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Some of the schools you know

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Sometimes you may have a sweat

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Many good schools

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Taiwanese may not know

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Like Vanderbilt, Emory Rice

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Maybe a lot of people know this school

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
But relative to the so-called

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Some schools that everyone is familiar with

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
They may not be so famous

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But they are in the professional field

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Or even in the United States

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Very distinguished

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
So just do more homework

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
To understand your own field

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Instead of being influenced by the ranking of schools

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Known by Taiwanese

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Because this may lose

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Some good opportunities

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Then the other one is

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So if you are not familiar with the school

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
How do you know

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
The teachers here are good

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
How to do homework

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Look at every teacher

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Research experience

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Do they have a research plan

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Or their field of research

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
These are all very important

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I hope everyone is in

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
These parts have to be considered

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Which ones do you need

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
To do the assessment

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
OK

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I'll put this part first

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Professor Chen

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Professor Chen, I can help you

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Let's ask Professor Chen

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
When you have considered all these things

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
When you are ready to apply for a school

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
How do you do this preparation

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
And what needs

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Professor Chen can also add

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
OK

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Can you hear me

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
All right

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
So now on the slide

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Basically you are preparing

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
During the application

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Will experience several

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Specific process

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
When everyone was preparing at the beginning

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
First prepare some

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
English test

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Then when you are ready

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
After the English test

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
It's not bad

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
The second thing is to prepare

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
To find the program you want to apply for

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Or the school you want to apply for

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Basically I suggest

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Don't look too much at once

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Use 5 plus

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
As a target

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Find the corresponding information

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I will give you an example later

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Can let you see

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
How to go through these processes

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
In the application process

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
You also have to prepare a lot

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Your

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Track record document

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
For example, your results

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
For example, your CV preparation

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
At this time

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I suggest everyone

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
The earlier the better

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Then there will be a very important

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Two documents

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
My personal feeling is

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
After being

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Graduate Search Committee

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I think

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
When reviewing abroad

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Review in the United States

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
When studying abroad

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Your Statement of Purpose

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
With Recognition Letter

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Are the two most important

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
And the most decisive

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Document

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
To decide if you will be admitted

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
When you prepare all these documents

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
You can go online

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Then go online application

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Basically this process

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
No matter which field you are

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Will not change much

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Time

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
The earlier the better

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
If you can come today

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Project Tara Webinar

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I believe to some extent

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You are more

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
You prepare early enough

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You know where to find some useful information

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Next slide

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Next slide

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Step by step

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
How to prepare

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Be careful

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Next slide

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Because I am a chemistry teacher

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I am in

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Houston

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Use our application

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
To make an example

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Let everyone know

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
When you want to do this

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Where to look for information

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
When you identify

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
When you want to apply for a school

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
First to the school

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Top of the department

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Basically

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You will see a

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
PhD Program

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Then you can click in

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Now in our department

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
There is a Apply Now

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
If you click in

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It will tell you

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
All kinds of application information

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
With basic requirements

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
you need

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Next page

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
After going in

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Usually some documents

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
You can't do much

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Modification

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
How are you before

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Now is the time to arrange

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
The most basic document

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Includes your

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
University or master's degree

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Certificate

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Next is your result sheet

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Next is your CV

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
These three documents

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Basically you can't think too much

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Especially your certificate

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And the result sheet

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
You only need

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
To go to the school

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Department

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Apply for these things

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
After applying

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
You have to spend

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Some time

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
With the school

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I believe there are some

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Help college students write their CV

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Some institutions

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
At this time

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I would suggest everyone to look for it

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And use these resources

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
To write your CV

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
To attract people

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Basically this thing

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You can't think too much

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
About your CV

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
If you can make it clear

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Simple is the best

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
But basically

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
There are not many things you can do

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Next is your English test

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
English test

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Basically what everyone sees

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
If you are in the United States

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Basically

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
One is TOEFL

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
One is GRE

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
More and more schools

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Especially

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Research Institute

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I think

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
People don't look at GRE

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Many schools include

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
UH

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Medical Center

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
RISE

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Basically in the next year

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
They didn't ask for GRE

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Graduation

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
So I think

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
At this stage

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I guess more and more schools

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Provide

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
This kind of convenience

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
This is because

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Everyone wants to recruit good international students

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Many international students

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
They look very outstanding in all aspects

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But on GRE

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
They can't pass the threshold

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That will cause a lot of sweat

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
In foreign schools

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
If you look at the results of GRE

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And the performance of students in the course

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Basically

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
There is no connection

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
So more and more schools are pushing

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Abolish GRE

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
So

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
If you don't know

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Do you want to apply for a school

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
GRE is necessary

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Then I would suggest

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Go to their website

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Look at their latest

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Certificate

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
On the other hand

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I think GRE is a

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Very important

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
English test

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Because

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
If you go to

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Tier 1 school

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Basically

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
There will be enough support

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
For students' salary

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
They provide you

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Financial support

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Basically ask you to be a TA

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
TA is the so-called

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Your main job is

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
You must

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Communicate with

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Undergraduate students

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You are a TA

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
You must have good enough

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
English expression ability

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
To help

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
University students study

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
So GRE is usually

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
There is no way

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Every school

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Requirements for GRE

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I think there has been a gradual rise in trends in recent years

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
So when you are preparing

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I would suggest

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Put more effort on TOEFL

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
GRE, I think

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
As expected

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Maybe in the future

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
There will be fewer and fewer schools requiring GRE

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Next slide

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
OK

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
This is

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
When you enter

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
After entering our website

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Every school

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
There will be a

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Frequently asked question

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The students will

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Always provide questions

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Usually in that part

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
You will see

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
The department will provide

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Very specific standards

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
This is before

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Revealed on our department website

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
GRE is still a

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Required document

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
On their

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
On our website

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It will provide

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Basically we must meet these requirements

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
For example, how many points do you need for TOEFL

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
How many points do you need for GRE

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
You are qualified

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Enter

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Graduate Search Committee to review

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Otherwise the school will directly

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Block your file

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
You don't even have the right to be reviewed

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
So

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Everyone must know when applying

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Are you in line with these

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Requirements

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Otherwise your application will be a mess

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
There is no way to be reviewed

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Alright

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Next slide please

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
OK

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Next we are going to talk about

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
The most important document

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
It's called Statement of Purpose

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
When I was young

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
When applying for school

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
When I was writing the Statement of Purpose

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I didn't know what to write

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
So I just wrote it

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
When I

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
After so many years

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
As a committee member

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
After so many years

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I summarized

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
A good Statement of Purpose

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Should include

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Several elements

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
The first element

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
I think it's motivation

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Basically it means

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Why do you want to apply

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Your Statement of Purpose

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
The second element

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
You have to

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Honestly discuss

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Your GPA

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
The third element

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You have to discuss

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Do you have any research experience

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
You can see

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I wrote leadership

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Leadership basically means

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Have you ever

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Worked with others

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
OK

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
The last one is research interest

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
OK

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
When you apply for school

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I think research interest

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Very important

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Because you have to

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Log into their website

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Find your own interesting teacher

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
So every school will be different

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You can't use the same

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Statement of Purpose

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
To vote for all schools

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
OK

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
If that's what you plan to do

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Basically

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I personally feel

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
It will be lower

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
OK

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Let's go back to the beginning

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Let's talk about

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
In these five elements

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What should you write

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Like the first one

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Motivation

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I think it goes back to what Professor Yang said

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
You have to think carefully

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Why do you want to take a PhD

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
OK

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Of course you can't write

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I just have nothing to do

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Not a strong

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Reasoning

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So everyone

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Why at the beginning

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Professor Yang

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I hope everyone can think about it

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Why do I want to apply for a PhD

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
OK

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Because in your Statement of Purpose

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Basically your beginning

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Will be a very important element

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
OK

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
The second one I wrote

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
The main reason I wrote this is because

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
When you are in elementary school

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
OK

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Very few students can be in

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Keep a good GPA for eight semesters

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
OK

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I take myself as an example

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
When I was young

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Especially when I was in freshman year

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
OK

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm not a student who likes to study

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
OK

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
My GPA is very, very bad

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
OK

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Then

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's so bad that I feel

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
If I really wrote it casually at that time

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I must not apply for school

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
OK

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
If you say

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
If you have a similar situation

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Maybe in your student life

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
In college life

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You may have one or two semesters

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
The GPA is very bad

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Then you have to think carefully

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
To make an explanation

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Because if you don't make an explanation

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
When the reviewer looks at your CV

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Look at your SOP

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I will start to think about it

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
OK, why didn't this student explain

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Why your grades were not good at that time

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
OK

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I take myself as an example

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
When I was in college

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
My grades in freshman year

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
In our class is very bad

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
The last class

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
There may be 60 students in our class

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I may rank around 50

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
My GPA may only be more than 2

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Yes

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
But when I

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
When I was in senior year

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And when I was in freshman year

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I may be the first or second in our class

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
So

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
At that time you will find

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
My case has become a relatively vague case

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Because when I was discussing my GPA

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I can say that when I was in freshman year

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I actually don't know what I want to do

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
OK

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So I just

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Find myself to relax

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
OK

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
When I realized that

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Chemistry is my passion

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
And I decided to be a chemistry teacher

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Things get wrong

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Right

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
This situation will be a very positive lead

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
OK

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
When you are discussing your GPA

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
When the reviewer

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Look at your

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
SOP

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
This is a big plus

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
OK

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
The best idea is that you always

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
If you don't have anything to say

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
That is very excellent

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
In that case, you just need to list

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
What you have won

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
OK

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
But I think GPA is a

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Everyone must think about it

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Explain why your GPA looks like this

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Everyone

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Put your GPA with what you want to do now

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That is to apply for Ph.D.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
To make a link

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
OK

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
What else can help you add points

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
This is the so-called research experience

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
OK

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Like me

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I went abroad to study after finishing my master's degree

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
So when I was studying for my master's degree

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In fact, I have already

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
For many

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Common scientific instruments

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Quite familiar

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
There is such a research experience

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
This is a big plus

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
The reason is that the students who apply in the United States

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
They basically

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Apply for Ph.D. directly from the university

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Ph.D.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
This is not popular in foreign countries

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
OK

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Because they apply for Ph.D. directly from the university

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
So many students actually don't have

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Enough

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Scientific training

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
If you say

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
You have done a lot of research

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Then this time

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Will be a big plus

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Then you have to explain

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
What you know

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
To prove

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
That this thing is

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
On scientific training

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Already have

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Enough maturity

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
OK

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
So if you have these

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
You have won some awards

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
You do some presentations

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Or you publish some papers

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
These will be big plus

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Another point is

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Leadership

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
This thing is actually

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Although the United States emphasizes heroism

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But when we review

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
A Ph.D. student

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
We actually value more

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Is this student

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Culturable

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Is it a talent

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
OK

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Can he be a team member

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Can he

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Cooperate with others

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Complete a project

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
OK

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
But at the same time have their own unique insights

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
OK

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
It sounds very

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Contradictory

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But in the end

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
When you become a Ph.D.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
You must have so many different characteristics

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
How to write

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
To prove

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Demonstrate you are a leader

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
The best

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Example

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
If you say

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Volunteer experience

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
OK

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
For example, you may go to the hospital

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Be an intern

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Interact with people

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
OK

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
What did you do

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
For example

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Because

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
You care about someone

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
You provide some advice

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Solve something

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
This will be a good example

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
OK

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
You can think about it

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Is there a similar example in everyday life

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
If not

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
If your application time is still long

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Try to find these opportunities

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So you can write it in your SOP

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
OK

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
The last one

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I think it is also

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Very important but also very time-consuming

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
A component

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You identify

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Which lab

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You are interested in

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Obviously this thing

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Must be done by every school

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
It will be very tiring

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
So if you do five schools

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Must look at

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
At least identify 15 faculties

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
But this thing will make your

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
SOP

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Very attractive

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
OK

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Especially when

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
The teacher you like

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Is their department

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Decide who can

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Admit

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Can decide

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
This time

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It will be very very powerful

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
OK

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
So I would suggest

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Don't be lazy

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Don't feel tired

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Really just put

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
The teacher in the department

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Find three

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Now basically every teacher

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Have their own website

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
So everyone just go in and take a look

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I suggest you take a look at their latest paper

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Don't find a paper

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
If you are going to do

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
One of these things

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I would suggest not to do this

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Because the research ten years ago

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
It will be very different now

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
So just read

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
What they wrote on the website

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Plus this one or two years of paper

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That's it

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
In this case you will have enough

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And profound understanding

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
OK

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And in this case

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Even that

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
The teacher in the paper is not the teacher you are interested in

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
They are very likely to refer to

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Those teachers you are interested in

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
If those teachers think you qualify

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Then you get the admission chance

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Will be a big expert

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
OK

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
So I think this is the summary

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
These key elements

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
For the study purpose

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Next slide please

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
OK

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
The last one is the so-called

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Recommendation letter

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
This thing

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I think in Taiwan

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
With what I saw in the United States

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
The difference is very, very big

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
OK

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I think the big reason is because

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
People don't usually talk to teachers

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Relationship

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
OK

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
So when you are a student

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Or when I was a student

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I'm actually very afraid of talking to teachers

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
OK

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
But when you go abroad

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I think it's a very important document

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
OK

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
In Taiwan, my feeling now is

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Teachers will teach students to write the draft of the recommendation letter first

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And then they do some minor modifications

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
OK

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Usually when students do this

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Basically

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
May be very close to your deadline

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
OK

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
The teacher basically doesn't know you

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You may be his student

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You may perform very well

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
He knows you

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
He doesn't know who you are

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
He doesn't really know who you are

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
He doesn't know what you want to do

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
He doesn't know what is your dream

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
OK

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
In this case

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
You draft the letter yourself

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And then sign it to the teacher

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
And then the teacher sends it to us for review

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
The most common case is that we see this letter

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
OK

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
This letter

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Very plain

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
OK

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
And this letter

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
This application document

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Basically will be put into

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Secondary pool

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
OK

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So when you want a recommendation letter

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You don't want a plain letter

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That doesn't help you

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
OK

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Sometimes it actually hurts you

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
OK

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
When we see a letter that says everything

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
But it seems like nothing is said

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Then we will try to

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Try to

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Read between the lines

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
OK

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
When you see a lot

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
When you save about one or two hundred minutes

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
You will know

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
The teacher doesn't really want to recommend you

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
If the teacher doesn't really want to recommend you

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Then we have to follow the teacher's advice

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Put you in

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
The category we don't like

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
OK

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
So how do you prepare your recommendation letter?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
The first is that you have to prepare early

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
How early is early

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Early until the teacher really knows you

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
OK

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
There are a lot of my students

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
When they are in the second year

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
They start to talk to me

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Start to discuss with me

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
What they want to do

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
OK

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
When they are in the third or fourth year

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
When they come to ask me for a letter

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I totally know

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
What are the characteristics of this student

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
OK

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
But there are students

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Like this

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I don't know this process

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
What kind of student

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
He may be a month before the application

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Come to ask me for a letter

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
OK

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
The first one I don't know this student

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Then the second

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
A month for me

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
For the teacher

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Generally speaking

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
For the professor

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
A month is a very short time

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
OK

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
For the teacher

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because it doesn't match

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
OK

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
So I would suggest you

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Once you decide to go abroad

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You can start talking to the teacher

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
OK

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You need at least three teachers

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Let them really know you

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Let them know

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
What kind of student you are

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
What are your strengths

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
When you go to ask for a recommendation letter

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
OK

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Don't just say

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Can you help me write a recommendation letter

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
This is actually a very irresponsible approach

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
The more appropriate approach is

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
OK

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
You have prepared your results

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Prepare your CV

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Prepare your SOP

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
OK

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
When you prepare all these documents

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And then talk to the teacher

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Believe me

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The teacher will be moved by your sincerity

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
OK

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Then I would suggest

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
When you really want to start

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
When I want you to help me write a recommendation letter

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's best to do it two months in advance

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
OK

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Basically, these documents must be prepared for the teacher

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
It's possible that your SOP is not fully prepared

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It doesn't matter

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Just put a draft

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
OK

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Let the teacher know

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
What do you think is the highlight of your life

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
When the teacher sees it

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Once the teacher knows what you are doing

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Once the teacher knows you

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
The teacher can play freely

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
OK

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
So you have to provide enough information to the teacher

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Give the teacher enough time

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
OK

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Of course, the sooner the better

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
OK

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
The other thing is

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
When the teacher agrees to help you write a recommendation letter

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I would suggest everyone

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
One week before due date

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
If you find that the teacher has not sent out the recommendation letter

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Give the teacher a reminder

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
OK

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
This is definitely a very appropriate action

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
So don't be shy

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Think OK

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I remind the teacher is a disrespectful behavior

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
No, this is a responsible behavior

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Because the teacher is sometimes too busy

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
He will forget a lot of things

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
OK

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
So don't be shy to remind the teacher

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I would suggest everyone

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
One week before due date

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Send a reminder to the teacher

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
OK

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Next please

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
OK

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
So we just talked about a lot of things

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Right

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
What makes you stand out

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
OK

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Usually everyone thinks

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
GPA

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
GRE

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Of course these things are important

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
OK

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
But I would say the importance of the English test

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
For science students

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I think the importance is relatively low

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
GPA is important

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Because GPA is our

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
The first criteria we use

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
To cut off

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Those not so great students

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
OK

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So if your GPA is not very good

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Then you can

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
The only chance you can get

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Admission

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
It comes from your SOP and your recommendation letters

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
OK

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
If those two are very strong

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
They will compete

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Your GPA

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
OK

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
SOP is a very very very

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Important document

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
OK

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
It takes a lot of time to prepare

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
OK

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Recommendation letter

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
You have to let the teacher know you

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
OK

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Taiwan's current

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Taiwan's current atmosphere

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I don't think it's a very healthy atmosphere

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Still a lot of

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Teachers ask students to write

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Draft

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
This is actually not very good

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
OK

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I found that very few teachers do this

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
OK

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
All right

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
So I guess

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
OK

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
So I guess

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Spend time

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
May be much longer than you think

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Because a lot of preparation

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
In fact, it's not just you

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
OK

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
You need the teacher's support

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You need time

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Put some key elements

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Make it

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
For example, you do research

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
For example, you are an intern

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
These things take time

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
So if you are now

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
If you want to go abroad

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Now you can probably start slowly

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Be prepared

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You won't feel so stressed

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
OK, next

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
OK, this is another

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I think I agree with Mr. Yang

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Is also a very

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Effective way

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
When you find a teacher

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
You really like it

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Like it so much

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
If you don't go

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Then I will suggest you

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Try to contact the professor

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
OK

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Abroad

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
From time to time

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
There will be students actively

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Come to contact us

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
This thing is actually very common

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
So when you do this

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Don't think it's a

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Very rare

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Then you shouldn't do it

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
You should think about it

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
This is a

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Can fully show that you are

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Actively looking for the right teacher

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
A mode

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
OK

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
When you contact the teacher

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Pay attention to

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Make sure

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Your tone is appropriate

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
OK

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Then

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
When you

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
When you write to the teacher

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
In your

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Email

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Just introduce yourself

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
But remember to attach your SOP

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Your CV and transcript

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
This way the teacher will know

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
What is the level of this student

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
He will decide

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Do you want to continue to contact you

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
OK

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Of course doing this

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
It may be a useful way

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
But it doesn't necessarily guarantee

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
You will get admission

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
OK

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
But I think it's worth a try

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
OK

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Next

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
OK

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Financial support

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
This is a very important thing

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
If you want to apply

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
School

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Belongs to R1

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
If you are a student

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
You don't have to worry about this

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
OK

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
In R1

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Teachers usually

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Will ask you to do TA or RA

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
OK

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I believe this part

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
For R1

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Not a problem

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
But

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Social science

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I believe you have to think about it

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
OK

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I want to ask Professor Yang

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
To add

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
His thoughts

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Thank you

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Professor Chen

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
This thing is basically

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Like what Professor Chen said

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
The students of the science department

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Because their resources are more abundant

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Then the funding is more abundant

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
So in my experience

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
The science department

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
If you are admitted to the doctor's class, you will definitely be paid

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
But social humanities

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
It's not necessarily like this

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
In the economy

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Especially in the past few years

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Because of the epidemic

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
In fact, many schools

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Funds are tight

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Some schools

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Will insist

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
For example, a fixed fee

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
In this case

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Some schools

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
If the number of people does not decrease

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Or some schools do not have enough funding

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
He might say

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
We will accept you

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
But we do not guarantee your funding

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Do you want to come

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Unfortunately, our social humanities

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Sometimes the funding is not so abundant

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
As I remember a few years ago

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Our department is now

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
We are in an interesting situation

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Many teachers in our department are very successful

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Get all kinds of research funding

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
This is a permanent

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
So permanent

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
If it is a school or department

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Long-term spending

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We can write it on the offer letter

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Tell the student

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
We provide you a few years of funding

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But we have a plan

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
For example, the three-year plan, the four-year plan

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Because that plan is so-called non-permanent

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
So we can't write it on the letter

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
We can also contact the student

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
We have this opportunity

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But we can't write it on the letter

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
For example, our student

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Older

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Because he is married and has children

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I remember he wrote a letter

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
He said

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
You did not guarantee that we have funding

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Do you know that I have a family and children

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Don't you make it difficult for me

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Although you are right

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
It's also very sad

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Sometimes there is this sad part

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
So I have to say

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
If it's my own student

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I give my own student advice

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I think this is very important

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Even I think this is the most important

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
If there are two or three schools

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
The ranking is almost the same

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
If the other conditions are almost the same

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Definitely consider going to a school that gives you funding

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
It's not just about money

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Of course there is funding

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
For you

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
It's been so long

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Your economic pressure will be much smaller

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
But it's not just about the economy

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Another one is when you have funding

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Especially you may have GRA

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Or fellowship

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Especially a graduate research assistant

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
It means you will be assigned to a teacher

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
To help the teacher plan

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Or even do research with the teacher

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Relatively speaking, it means that there is a teacher

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Will pay special attention to your progress

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
For you

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
This is an opportunity to get along with the teacher

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You can learn from the teacher

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Usually you don't have funding

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
It's not that you can't find a teacher to work with

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
But that one

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
If you have this job opportunity

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
The level you can understand

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Will be much weaker

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Even if it's a GTA

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
You can also

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It should be to help my teacher

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Teaching assistant

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
For example, you can follow the class

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Then see how the teacher teaches

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
You can also have a deep connection with the teacher

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So no matter what I think

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Financial support

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I will put it with the student

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I will put it in a very high priority

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Unless for example

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
You don't need to think about it

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
This is of course

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
You may still choose your dream school

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
But of course

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
All the conditions are the same

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I still recommend

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Financial support school

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
If it's the school's budget

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Some schools give GRA

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Some schools give fellowship

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
GRA

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I think it's best for students

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Why is it best for students

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Some school fellowships

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
No compulsory

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Of course it's a good thing

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
When students have a high degree of autonomy

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Or when students know what to do

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
You have the autonomy to follow the teacher

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Who do I want to follow

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You bring the research you want to do

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Of course there is a gap in each department

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
But GRA

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It's basically you

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
If you don't have a very clear direction

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
In fact, it is a better start for students

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Let you have some opportunities

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Contact research work

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
GRA is for

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Language will be more demanding

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Because you have to face the students directly

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Then for example, take homework

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Some courses you may have to bring

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Or some parts you may need

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
There is a group discussion time

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
In terms of language

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It becomes a very important thing

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You have to be able to get in touch with students directly

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That part is

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I think it's good

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
There are a lot of English students in Taiwan

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It's not bad

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
After five years of teaching

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The experience of teaching again in the United States

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Now Taiwanese students

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
English is generally much better than when we were in college

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So in terms of language

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But this is still a

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Adapting process

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So I mean if there is a choice

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I will encourage students to choose GRA

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
If there is no choice, of course

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
It's really like this

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Then of course

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But this is your dream school

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I have seen other students

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
For example

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Libraries also provide jobs

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Even I have seen students

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Work in the school's gym

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Administrative office

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Of course it's all for me

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
If you want to study English

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Or maybe it's a process

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It's too much

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Just waiting for you to find a chance

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But if you really didn't

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
If not

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This is also a

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Out-of-the-box thinking

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And of course

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
In addition to the school

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Since everyone is studying in Taiwan

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I just want to go abroad

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
The Ministry of Science and Technology also provides scholarships abroad

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The Ministry of Education also has the Ministry of Education

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
A lot of scholarships

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Like Fulbright

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Or even if you are already studying in the United States

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Then the school funding may be

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Especially our social science

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It's often read to the end of the world

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Even if the school guarantees you four or five years of funding

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Maybe I'm still not enough

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The school also provides dissertation fellowship

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Or some institutions like

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The Ministry of Justice

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Or NIH or something

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
There will be a dissertation fellowship

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This can all be discussed with the teacher

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
You need the teacher to support you to apply

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Then the teacher will usually be happy

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
If you have a good idea

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Then this will usually provide you

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Not only your stipend

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
It will also provide you some research funding

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So you can go

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
If you can do your research well

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
If you have such a dissertation fellowship

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
In fact, it is also a bonus for you

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It means you have a good experience

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Your process

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
In fact, your research has been

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The evaluation is recognized

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I think your achievements are good

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So this is also a very good experience

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
There are many other funding sources

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I have suggested my students to apply

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Like what female scientists

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Some scholarship

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That's not a lot

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But in the process

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
You can put it on your CV

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Some experience

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's a good thing to have this experience

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
What you need to pay attention to

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The eligibility requirements for each scholarship

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Different

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Like Fulbright, Monster

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Education

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
They all have requirements

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
For example, two years of residency

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
For example, especially Fulbright is quite strict

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
When you get your degree

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You need to go back to your motherland

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Then do two years of service

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Some of these things you need to understand

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
If it's like the United States

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Government agencies

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Some fellowships will require you to have a green card

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
These things need to be read clearly

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
What are the requirements for you

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I hope the information you send

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Do you meet

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Even if you have GREGT

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Sometimes you can also

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
See if there are other funds

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Can apply to help you

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
In the process of learning

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
For example, to supplement your research funding

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Some of the costs of attending international conferences

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
This is also a way to consider

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Of course, the most important thing

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
If you want to study for a doctorate

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Usually when you apply for a fellowship

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Because again, all humanities

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
It's not so abundant

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
If you get admission, it means you have money

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That's not the case

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You have to hook

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Do you want to be considered for funding

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
This is very important

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
This goes with what Professor Chen just said

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Contact the teacher if the teacher has funding

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
If the teacher thinks the research is suitable

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
In addition to the teacher

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I want to talk to the department

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I think this student is good

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
We can support him

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
If the teacher has funding

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
The first thing that comes to mind is

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
This student, I have this plan now

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Is it possible to find him to take this plan

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Like before

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We received a student

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
In fact, he did not get our department's funding

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
He was very proactive

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
He wrote very specific

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Not a letter

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Then he received a response

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And very active

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Can I schedule a virtual meeting with you

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Now everyone is used to virtual meetings

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It doesn't take a lot of time

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I know there are several colleagues

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Including me, I talked to him for half an hour

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I know his experience is quite special

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Sometimes I feel so active

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You also hope that if there is a chance

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Give him a chance to try

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This Taiwanese student

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I want to tell the students

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
In fact, especially in the United States

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
In this cultural environment

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
If you take the initiative

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
In fact, there is a benefit

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Give you a chance to show yourself

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Even give you a chance

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Let others know you

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
This is not a bad thing

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Of course, it's not just writing an email

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Talk to everyone casually

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Of course you have to do this

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Of course, be fully prepared

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Practice well

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
To do this kind of contact work

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Then

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So what should I say

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Of course, I emphasize that I think

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Financial support is very important

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
But it doesn't mean

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You didn't hear it at the beginning

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
There will be no chance

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Speaking of this, I think

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It's a very inspirational case

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Just now

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Mr. Chen said that his university hospital GPA is not very good

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
It doesn't matter

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
My first, second, third, fourth GPA is not very good

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So I had to study in a research institute

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Study a master's degree

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
That master's degree, of course, is not bad

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Turned to the field

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I was a psychology major

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Turned to criminal studies

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You can say a lot

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Why do I study this

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I have my own internship experience

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So it's not that

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Master's degree is not an advantage

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But that gives you a chance

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Demonstrate your academic research

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Because college students are usually

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But you have a master's degree

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You will have more food experience

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Even research experience

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
There may even be a master's thesis

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
To support

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You are not only potential

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But you already have some performance

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So this is also an idea

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Then

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
OK, wait a minute, I seem to jump

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I don't like to jump to the front page

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
That's probably

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
A situation like this

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Mr. Chen, are we

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
If you have any questions

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
If you have any questions

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
If you want to discuss with us

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Thank you for the two professors

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The sharing is very

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
A lot of details

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Then we want to say

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Wei Zhe has put it before

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The registration form

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
If Wei Zhe has given us before

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
We should all write

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I have seen Wei Zhe before

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Give me the list

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
We should all write

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
In our PowerPoint

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Or is there anything we didn't mention

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Or did you say that

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I didn't notice

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I think you've covered a lot of questions

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's very detailed

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Thank you

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Thank you

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Thank you

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Thank you

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Thank you

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Thank you

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Thank you

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Thank you

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Thank you

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Thank you

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Thank you

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I think I've probably done it

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So now

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Is there anyone at the scene who has any questions?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
If you feel embarrassed to ask

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You are also welcome to

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I or Yixuan

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Or other staff you know

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
We will help you

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Ask the professor

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Ok, wait

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Mr. Chen

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I have a question for you

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
How do I

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
How do I get to know you

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
How do I get to know you

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Ok, Tsingtao Materials

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Ok

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm from Tsingtao, so I'm good

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Ok

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So the first one is

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
From a review point of view

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Is it positive to have an internship at a company?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yes

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But the point is

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
If you have an internship somewhere

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
It's useless

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
The point is

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Is there any story in your internship

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
You can tell

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
In your SOP

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
To reinforce

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Reviewer's impression

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You know you are a

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
A person who can be a team worker

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
When you are a team worker

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You can also show your leader's talent

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
If there is such an article

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's definitely a big plus

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Is it constructive to let the teacher know you early?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yes

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Usually I think

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
More approachable

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Step would be

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
You find some

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Classes that you think you are better at

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Try to

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Talk to the teacher

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
In Taiwan

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I don't know if everyone is used to

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
When you are in class

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Encounter some problems

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Have you taken the initiative to find a teacher

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
The habit of asking questions

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
If not

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
To

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Start to develop this habit

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Because I think this habit will let you

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Improve very quickly in all aspects

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Because when you have a chance

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Talk to the teacher

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
At the time

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
You will know

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
The teacher's idea

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
There is actually a very big difference

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
The main reason is because

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
The teacher is actually

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
On the other side

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
The side you see

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
The person who does the operation

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
You have to talk to the teacher

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You have to say

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
What are the attitudes of these reviewers

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What are their focus

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Once you have

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
After this information

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You are preparing your materials

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Will be more efficient

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
You don't have to think about it

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
The materials you prepared

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Will be more

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Really able to address

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
What these reviewers want to see

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
OK

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
If you say this

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
If you start doing it in the second or third year

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
OK

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
If you say you are off duty

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
After a year

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
If you want to go abroad

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I think you have to do it now

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Another

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The method is

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
If you have a partner

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
If you have a co-director

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
There are basically only two recommendations

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Let the teachers

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Have a good impression of you

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Get things done

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Give the teacher enough time

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I think

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The teacher's letter is usually good

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
OK

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I hope this answers

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
The question of the student

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
There is a second question

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I think it should be

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
For the recommended choice

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Will choose

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
The same field but not the most familiar

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Or two different fields

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
But a teacher who is familiar with himself

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Professor Yang answered that he was more inclined to be two

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Can you give me a reason

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
What do you think

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Because like we said

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Now apply for a doctorate

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Your field

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It's impossible for you to be in the same field as now

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You usually have to read the doctorate

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
You will read more professionally

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
You have to do some changes in the teacher's field

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It's more important

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
You are in college or doing something

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
What kind of experience do you have

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Your performance

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Whether it's your class performance

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Or your performance with the teacher

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Of course, find a teacher who is familiar with you

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
To be able to recommend you more deeply

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Where is your strength

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Where is your performance

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You find the same field

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's like what Mr. Chen just said

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's better not to write

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I don't know how to recommend

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You have to be in the same field

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
But you are not familiar with me

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
What am I going to write

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
It's not good for you

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
It's better to find

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
What we mean by familiar

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's not that you have a good relationship with the teacher

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's not useful

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I often go to the bathroom with the teacher

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's not like that

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
The teacher may be able to evaluate your personality

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But not only personality

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Familiar is that you take the teacher's class

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I think it's very impressive

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
For example, you often take the initiative to ask the teacher

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
For example, after class, go to the teacher to discuss

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Or the teacher has a very good impression of your research plan

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Or something

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It's like this

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I don't know if this answer

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Mr. Chen, do you want to add

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I think Mr. Yang said very well

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I think it's the field

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Everyone will find it when they get older

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Not so important

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I use my own example

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
My university is doing 5G material synthesis

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I went abroad to study

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
When I went abroad to study

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Physics and chemistry

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
When I was a doctor

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's biophysics

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And now it's neuroscience

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Biophysics

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I've been turning my field

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
So I think the field is actually in

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
When you do high-level education

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's not that important

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Because in the end everyone is together

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You need knowledge in all aspects

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
To do integration

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
The teacher must really know you

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
When the teacher is writing a recommendation

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Don't let everyone think

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The teacher's recommendation is

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'm familiar with you, I'll write you well

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Not like this

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
A strong recommendation must be a

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Fact-based recommendation

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
OK

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
The teacher will do what you do

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Then comment on that thing

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
From his point of view

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
OK, the student did this thing

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
From my point of view

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
What are the advantages

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
What is it that I think

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's very suitable for a PhD student

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
OK, so if you're just

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'm familiar with the teacher

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
OK, but you don't have any specific evidence

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Please write the teacher

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It's also difficult for the teacher to write

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
A strong and powerful recommendation

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So don't forget your root

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You are actually

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
The performance is very strong

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
The teacher knows you

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
The teacher can follow you

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Do further comment

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
This will be a strong recommendation

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
OK, you have to let the teacher know

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You know so much

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
What did you do

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Then let the teacher extend from this thing

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
His unique idea of ​​you

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
These all take time

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
OK, I hope this answers

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
The student's question

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I believe

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
For the recommendation

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Is to give more detailed information

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
The next question is from

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I want to ask

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I'm sorry

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I just found out

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
On the way to the speech

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Someone asked two questions

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So I want to say because that student

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Asked me early

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Ask the student first

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
OK, no problem

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Thank you

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
The first question of this student is

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I want to ask the teacher GPA

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Every semester in college

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
About 3.8 to 4

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Do you still need to spend the score sheet to write

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Or can you not mention it at all in the architecture

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
See the score sheet or CV is enough

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I can mention

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
If you are 3.8 to 4

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Then you must have won a lot of awards

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Right

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Then you have to write what you have won

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Or like this

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Then my other one is

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
If you only have a good GPA

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Then there is nothing else to mention in life

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Then only mention GPA

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Am I talking too much

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But of course I hope

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
In addition to GPA

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
There are more in-depth questions

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Why do I want to do this research

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Why do I want to do this research

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That thing your motivation

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
It's definitely not because I have a GPA of 3.8

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's definitely not like this

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
So I think SOP is for you

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Do some more in-depth

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Introduction

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Your own process

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
How your research experience

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
How did you get to this step

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You can also say because of me

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Very enthusiastic

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
So my grades are very good

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Of course you won't take the initiative

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
My grades are all 3.8 4.0

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Everyone will say so

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
So that's not the point

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Then because you introduce you

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You can write it clearly on your CV

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You will also write it clearly on your CV

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
But you will mention that there must be a purpose

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I want to say because of me

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I am very enthusiastic about these lessons

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Although I work in full time

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I still maintain my grades very well

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Bring this thing into a situation like this

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Instead of the main thing

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
My grades are very good

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Otherwise, life is a bit sad

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I finished writing your SOP in one paragraph

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think I want to add

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
If GPA

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
If GPA

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Then

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
You should be able to

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Use GPA as an example

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Use GPA as an example

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
To say that GPA is so good

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
No one is

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Just for the sake of GPA

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The reason why your GPA is good

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
There must be a reason in your heart

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Why should I make my GPA so good

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
The most direct way to think about it

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
You are really enthusiastic about this science

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
You can use your GPA as a proof

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You can say

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
What am I particularly interested in

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So I spent a lot of time

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So I spent a lot of time

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
On this special project

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Inventor's Outcome

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
My GPA is very good

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
This is also OK

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
When you are drafting these things

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
GPA can be used as a fact

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
GPA can be used as a fact

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You have to explain

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Why in this

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
How to connect this fact

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I want to apply for a Ph.D.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I want to apply for a Ph.D.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
OK

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Word is a very

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Strong and meaningful fact

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
If a person

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Has been winning the Nobel Prize for so many years

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
He immediately

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Brought out the message

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
This student is very

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Knowledgeable

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And very

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Persistent

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
If there are these records

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Reviewers will also explain

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Why can this student

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Continue to perform so well for so long

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Right?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
What are his characteristics?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It looks very clear

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The results of this thing

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
For students with good grades

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
That section

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Not so critical

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It is important

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
But it won't be a

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Breaking point

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But when your GPA is not so outstanding

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
But when your GPA is not so outstanding

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
You still hope to be accepted

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The story behind

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
You have to make it clear

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I hope I can answer

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
The question of that student

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Wei Zhe

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
He has another question

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
The other question of the same student

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
The other question of the same student

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
He is currently with his former intern

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
He is currently with his former intern

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Want to let the other person know more

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
His question is

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
His question is

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
When talking to the former intern

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
What do you think about forms?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
What do you think about forms?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You have not prepared the terms of the forms

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You have not prepared the terms of the forms

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Still want to ask this famous student

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
This famous student

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Maybe 1 month later

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Maybe 1 month later

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Start again

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Start again

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Do you talk about school application?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Do you talk about school application?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Do you talk about school application?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
16 months

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Suddenly contacted

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
suddenly contacted

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Go to chat with the teacher later

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Go to chat with the teacher later

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Go to chat with the teacher later

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Should not chat

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Should not chat with the teacher later

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Should not chat with the teacher later

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.820
If the teacher's response is also good, then tell the teacher directly

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.820
Of course you can tell the teacher

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:09.820
Something is still being prepared

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.820
What is the result

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.820
I have to give it to the teacher first

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.820
The remaining thing I prepared and sent it to the teacher

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.820
It's very clear to tell the teacher

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.820
I want to add

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.820
My experience

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.820
Like talking to me

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.820
want

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.820
Recommended students

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.820
I agree with the recommended students

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640
At the beginning

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.640
Will ask the teacher

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.640
What is the opinion of the class

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.640
OK

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.640
I think this is a good point

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.640
Just

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.640
Demonstrate

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.640
You are interested in applying for the class

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.640
But you are not so sure

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.640
If you ask the teacher about this

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.640
You will let the teacher know

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.640
This student is likely to apply for the class

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.640
Then I can put

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.460
You don't have to prepare anything at this stage

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.460
Right

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.460
But when you do this

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.460
Tell the teacher

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.460
I think I will

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.460
Interested in research

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.460
But my knowledge of the doctoral class is very limited

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.460
Can you share with me

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.460
Do you know the doctoral class

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.460
I believe it will be for me

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.460
Decide my future life

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.460
Has a great help

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.460
In this case

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.460
You don't have to worry about whether you have prepared your file

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.280
You can start from the teacher

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.280
Let you know

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.280
What do you think about the other side

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280
The teacher will know

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.280
This student is likely to apply for the doctoral class

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.280
After several talks

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.280
Actually

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.280
When you ask the teacher for a recommendation letter

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.280
The teacher already has enough knowledge

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280
When you really want to apply

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.280
Give the teacher enough time to write

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.280
Then put your

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Grades

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.280
CV and SOP to the teacher

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.100
OK

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100
OK

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.100
Is this OK

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.100
Should be OK

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.100
If we follow the chat

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100
Answer directly

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.100
For example, Carrie asked

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.100
Can you ask the teacher directly

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.100
Of course

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100
Because sometimes you tell the teacher

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.100
I want to apply for the doctoral class

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.100
When the teacher is interested in the teacher's work

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.920
Usually the teacher will tell you directly

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.920
The teacher won't say he's not here

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.920
And he won't tell you in the past few years

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.920
The teacher won't do this

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.920
If you know that the teacher is interested in your work

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.920
The teacher will tell you directly

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.920
Of course you can ask

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.920
In fact, the teacher will answer directly

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.920
Teacher Chen asked a lot of questions

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.920
I will read it

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.920
Some may be answered by Teacher Chen

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.920
OK

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.920
Let you answer this part

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.920
He said

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.740
Is leadership important for all fields?

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.740
Or is it more emphasis on some fields?

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.740
Leadership

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.740
I think there is a bonus

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.740
If not, it won't matter

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.740
Some schools will become very important

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.740
I see

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.740
I think the most important thing now

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.740
If you want to go to medical school

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.740
Medical school

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.740
Leadership

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740
Everyone has to have

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.740
If you apply for a foreign school in Taiwan

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:24.740
I think if it's a general R1 school

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Not so much

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.560
But if you have

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.560
It will be a bonus

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560
I will add one more thing

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
I think leadership is more important

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
When you apply for a teaching job

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560
When applying for a teaching job

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560
Leadership will be more important than graduate students

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.560
More important

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.560
Yes

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.560
I agree

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560
Then

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560
He said that if he had known

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560
Can you mention the graduation age first?

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.380
How many years can you consider taking the exam?

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:58.380
How many years to intern outside?

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.380
I can only say that dreams are sweet

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.380
Reality is bitter

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.380
Does Teacher Chen want to add anything?

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.380
Of course you can mention

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.380
But do you want to ask the teacher to write the contract?

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.380
The teacher has to sign

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.380
How many years do I have to take the exam?

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.380
And how many years can I intern?

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:16.380
I think of course you can mention

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.380
But sometimes the teacher has to work with you

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:20.380
To know your situation

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.380
Or look at your questions

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.200
Then you may have to

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.200
Or I have a good class

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.200
The teacher told me

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200
Don't take classes anymore

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.200
You have more credits than college students

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Okay, I should be ready to graduate

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.200
Everyone has a different

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.200
But this thing

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.200
At least in our society

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.200
I don't know if natural science can sign a contract

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.200
I guess there is no way

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.200
I think this question

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.200
The topic we talked about today

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.200
It's a bit irrelevant

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.020
Now we focus more on how to apply

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.020
This is more like you have already got the admission

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.020
You have to find a teacher

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.020
Can you ask these questions?

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020
For this question

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.020
I think

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.020
If you want to find the real answer

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.020
In fact, it is not to ask the instructor

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.020
But to ask the student of the instructor

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.020
You are quite reasonable

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.020
Will be closer to

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.020
Your actual expectations

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.020
Because

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.020
To be honest

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840
Usually

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840
You won't get any useful information

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
If you get the answer

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840
You will say it depends

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840
Because too many things will decide

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840
The timeline of graduation

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
If the teacher says you have to submit three papers

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840
To graduate

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840
If you find the experiment is stuck

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840
What should you do?

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.840
You don't want the teacher to use

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.840
Specific papers to limit your graduation time

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840
Right?

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.840
So I think this is very professor-dependent

01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:51.660
So when you are a non-admission

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.660
There are still a lot of questions

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.660
How do you choose a teacher?

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.660
What should you focus on?

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.660
Of course, we didn't talk about it today

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.660
I think

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.660
If you think

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.660
This is really a problem

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.660
I think you can participate

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.660
Maybe Tara has some other

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.660
Webinars

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.660
Talk about

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.660
How to choose

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.660
Advisor

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.480
How to have a successful PhD

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.480
I think that's a good topic

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.480
If you just want

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.480
First-layer information

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.480
I think

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.480
You don't need to ask the teacher

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.480
Because you won't get any useful answer

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.480
Maybe it's better to ask the students

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.480
If it's the same

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.480
We skip the advisor part

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.480
Because it's also

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.480
How to have a successful experience

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.480
Guanjing

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.480
She said

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Not good enough

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
But you have the paper experience

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
That's good

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
But you have the research experience

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
That's also good

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And then outstanding

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
That's beneficial

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And outstanding

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I think

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Well, I don't think

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Everyone is outstanding

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
If everyone is outstanding

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Then no one is outstanding

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So I think

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
What I should do is

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
How to present my best side

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
To the reviewer in the best way

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I think that's enough

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
The word outstanding is too heavy

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yeah

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
You say

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
You say we receive the best students

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Is it outstanding?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I said most of the time it's not outstanding

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Right?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But are we looking for outstanding students?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
No, we don't actually need outstanding students

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
OK

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
We just need a coachable

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
OK

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Then we can

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
We think he can grow and become a Ph.D.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Under our education system

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Then my definition of Ph.D.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Of course

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
When this student encounters a problem

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
He can come up with solutions

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
He can find available resources

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
OK

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Come up with proper hypothesis

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Design a proper experiment

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
OK

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Then we can figure out what's going on

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
That's my definition of Ph.D.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Right?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Do we need to be outstanding?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
No, we don't

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
As long as we are coachable

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And know how to do things

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Right?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And have basic scientific sense

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
That's enough

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
So don't put so much pressure on yourself

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
To make yourself outstanding

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
If you want to make yourself outstanding

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I'm sorry

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
We are done with the discussion

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Recommendation to find a non-Ph.D.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I think it's OK

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Chinese Academy of Sciences is also a research position

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
If you have any real research experience

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And some cooperation

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
That's definitely fine

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I believe we both agree

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
The point is

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Whether you can really evaluate your ability

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Your potential

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Or your research experience

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I think it's this

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I think this is what we were talking about

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
In the presentation

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Do you have any other potential you would like to see

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Other than your academic achievement

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I think this is area-dependent

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I guess

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
In the field of natural science

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Do you have any lab experience

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
What skills do you have

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That's important

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
In the field of social humanities

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Maybe

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Your social participation

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Your social care

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Or something like this

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Maybe it's important to us

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
That's a motivation

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Especially if I study criminal studies

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Some of our students

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
They are very concerned about social justice

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
They have some

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
What kind of group or what kind of leadership

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
What kind of library

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Those things become important

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
So what I think is

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Maybe you can look at different areas

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I think this thing is actually quite area-dependent

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So I don't think we can deal with it

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
External funding

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You said public funding

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
There's Director Huang up there

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I'd like to thank you

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Director Huang

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
But the question he asked

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
If he had his own

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Department of Education

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
My last name is Lan

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But Professor Yang

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I think his question is

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
If he had his own

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Department of Education

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Department of Education

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I think he's asking

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
If he brought his own funding

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Does it increase

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
For example, the chance of being accepted by the school

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
There are two points

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That is

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
The basic answer is yes

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Because that means

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
It's your external recognition

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Like we just mentioned

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
This is your recognition of you

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
You've been evaluated

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
You can say I'm the only winner

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
That means you have potential in this place

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
But the other part

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I saw an experience last year

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
A student in Taiwan

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
He applied for a B.S.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And then he applied

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Of course, many students want it

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
But when the economy is more

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I know

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Some schools say

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Since you have money, we won't give you money

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So the students feel very depressed

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Why should I lie to the school

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I didn't bring any money

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
The school will give me the money

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Because the student is quite good

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
My answer is

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I don't think it's necessary

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Because he still found

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
He brought the money

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
He is still willing to give him the money

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It's just that it may not be his first or second choice

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
My idea is

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Of course, when the school's budget is tight

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
There will be such considerations

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
How to divide some of the money

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
To the most students

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
He would like to say that you have money

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
To what extent

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And what kind of help

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The student told me

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
If I don't bring the school's budget

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I still have the school's budget

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
The school's budget may only be given to you for three years

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You may have to measure this yourself

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Basically, yes, you are

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I think so

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Age will not

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Age will never be deducted

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
If the United States asks the age

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Age will not be the deduction point

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I believe me and Mr. Chen

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
We are basically like this

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Age will not be deducted

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
If you have work experience

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
In fact, it is usually a bonus

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I want to add

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Basically, I agree with Mr. Yang

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But if you are

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Maybe 40 or 50

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
If you come out to read PhD

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
The reviewer may have some concerns

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
We actually had a lot before

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I've been working in the industry for a long time

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Because everyone knows

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
But it turns out that what you bring is different

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Like they are actually in the government

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
After working for more than ten years

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
He will bring in a lot of food experience

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
So that means

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Usually I guess the research institute

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
No school will be all

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
These students came in

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But there will be some students like this

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Is to increase its diversity

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
But you will never

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But definitely not because of age

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
He won't see how old you are

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Basically this will not happen

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
When everyone is reviewing your information

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Will feel that this person is very interesting

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So they will do more discussion

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I think it will

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
At least in

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I think there may be this kind of situation in science and engineering

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Because everyone expects students

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Everyone hopes

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Promote young students

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Education

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
In this case, let's say you are very old

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I don't know how old I am

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Maybe 60 or 70 years old

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Some are too old

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
It's very difficult to move a steel bottle

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
There may be some problems in actual operation

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
They may

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
There will be a more in-depth discussion about this case

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I should say this

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
But basically

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
The age should not be a problem

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The student asked

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Your statement of purpose

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Do you want to write it very carefully

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Like a proposal or a summary

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I think this thing

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Is

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Proposal

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Because he has some

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
If you look at the teacher for too long

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
There will be no way to endure

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
To be honest

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
But if you write too rough

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I'm just interested in this

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
There is no evidence to prove

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I think it's too weak

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
So I think

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
What are you interested in

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
If you can support

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Why are you interested in this

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Instead of just saying that I am interested in this

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I think this is a stronger case

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Of course, I don't know how to write it like a proposal

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Unless the school specifically requires you to write a proposal

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I think it's in the middle

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I think this is a good practice

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Let everyone be able to use two or three

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Two or three sentences

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Summarize what you have learned

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I think it takes time to practice

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Like Mr. Yang said

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I don't think you can write it too fine

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
You can't write it too broad

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
It must be right

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
We were reminded

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
That we are already entering the breakout section

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And we are over time

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It turned out to be 9.30

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
We are already over time

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Let's go to the breakout room first

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I'm sorry to bother you

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Please help us get to the breakout room

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
OK

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I would like to remind you

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Let me remind everyone

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
We are now divided into two breakout room

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
If you have any questions

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
For professors in different fields

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
You are welcome to

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Ask questions in the corresponding field

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
If there is a question

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
In the general Q&A session

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
If it is not answered

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
You are also welcome to

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Ask the professor

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
In the general breakout room

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Ideally, you should be able to

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Choose the breakout room

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
We will leave one or two people

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
In the main session

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
To answer some technical questions

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
If you have any technical questions

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
You are welcome to let me know

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Thank you Wei Zhe

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Thanks Wei Zhe

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Wei Zhe and Terry were talking about writing sample.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
How important is writing sample?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Sociology students want to know how good your English writing ability is.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Sociology students focus on your English ability.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
You need to be able to communicate, even write.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's similar to SOP.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
You need to be able to convince people that you have an important goal.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Writing sample wants to know how good your academic ability is,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
and how good your English ability is.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
The recommended direction is what you have written before.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Of course, writing an essay or diary will be a little awkward.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Of course, it is more focused on academic papers.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Unless you are applying to the Department of Humanities and Sciences,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000
for example, you are applying for a master's degree in literature.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Of course, it is more related to the field of writing.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Let me explain.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Professor Yang is assigned to the first breakout session.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Professor Chen is assigned to the second breakout session.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Everyone else is assigned to the second breakout session.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
You can choose to accept or not accept.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Thank you, Professor Chen.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Thank you, both professors.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
There is no follow-up after the breakout session today.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
You can leave the meeting now.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:00.000
