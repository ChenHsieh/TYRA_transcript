0	8000	Thank you all for attending this lecture.
8000	13000	I am a PhD student at the University of Belize.
13000	17000	I am very happy to be able to host this lecture for Project TIRA.
17000	21000	From seeing people from satellites, urban transformation, moving and mental health,
21000	24000	applying remote data and machine learning cross-field research.
24000	27000	TIRA is a PhD student from various fields in Taiwan,
27000	34000	an organization made up of PhD students, post-doctorate researchers and assistant professors.
34000	40000	We hope to connect young researchers from different fields.
40000	44000	Today's speaker, Chi-Hsing, we met in the first English class.
44000	47000	We belong to different fields of science and technology.
47000	51000	Recently, because of this lecture, we are in contact again.
51000	54000	I think this is the purpose of Project TIRA.
54000	58000	To connect scholars from different fields.
58000	66000	Chi-Hsing just got his doctorate from the Department of Environmental Science at the University of Austria.
66000	70000	He is currently a post-doctoral researcher at Yale University.
70000	72000	When he was a post-doctoral student,
72000	78000	he conducted research on typhoons in Taiwan and the Philippines.
78000	82000	During his post-doctoral studies, he also conducted research in the United States.
82000	86000	His current post-doctoral research project is mainly in the Himalayas.
86000	92000	In the next two years, he will receive the Yale Gallaudet Donnelly Fellowship.
92000	95000	He is expected to travel from Africa to the world.
95000	99000	Chi-Hsing will give a lecture for about an hour.
99000	103000	After that, there will be a Q&A time.
103000	107000	I don't have much to say about Chi-Hsing, so I'll give you the time.
107000	108000	Thank you.
110000	114000	Thank you, everyone.
114000	119000	Today, I will divide this lecture into two parts.
119000	128000	The first part is about how we can use satellite imagery and machine learning to detect loss.
128000	135000	The second part will focus on the relationship between loss and mental health in Denmark.
135000	140000	Before we start, I'd like to take a short break.
140000	144000	If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
146000	153000	Please let me know if the connection is bad.
154000	165000	At the beginning, I'd like to talk about my research theme from a view that you may be familiar with.
165000	171000	In this photo of Taipei City, if you can see my mouse,
171000	175000	this road here, the road under the building, what is it like?
176000	179000	In the north of Zhongshuo East Road,
179000	187000	you can imagine that this area is more like an apartment building.
187000	193000	The density of the street is higher, and the width of the street is narrower.
193000	199000	In the south of Zhongshuo East Road, the business district,
199000	203000	we can see that the construction rate is much lower.
203000	206000	There is a lot of space between the buildings.
206000	211000	At the same time, it is not a low-density form.
211000	215000	If you look at it from a vertical perspective, it has a lot of skyscrapers.
215000	223000	In the past, many urban planners and environmental scientists
223000	232000	have been thinking about what kind of urban form is the best or the most sustainable.
233000	238000	In terms of sustainability, there are two aspects that have often been discussed in the past.
238000	245000	The first is how to make urban planning reach the goal of carbon reduction under the climate change.
245000	252000	For example, if today's land use configuration can make the workplace and residences close enough,
252000	256000	so that people don't have to travel a long distance when they're on vacation,
256000	259000	this can achieve the effect of carbon reduction.
259000	269000	The second aspect of the study is to regard the city as a separate system for land use.
269000	274000	In addition to the city, there are usually rural areas or natural protected areas.
274000	277000	For environmental scientists and eco-scientists,
277000	286000	if we can make the city's land use appear in a very limited space range and efficiently expand to other places,
286000	292000	then we can save more land for agriculture or other crops.
292000	304000	My interest in the study is a little different from the two aspects of the city as another aspect of the environment.
304000	307000	What I'm interested in is the part about people.
307000	312000	When we talk about sustainability, it's not about the sustainability of the environment,
312000	315000	but it's about people and the environment.
315000	321000	People themselves have to be able to live in this place in a sustainable way.
321000	326000	I'm very lucky to work on this project during my Ph.D. period.
326000	329000	The main theme of the project is psychological health.
329000	332000	I also had the opportunity to start working on this project.
332000	336000	I'd like to give you a data on psychological health.
337000	339000	In the past ten years,
339000	343000	the World Health Organization has conducted a survey of various countries around the world.
343000	347000	It can be found that an average of four people in the world
347000	351000	will have a certain stage in their life when they are affected by any psychological disease.
351000	358000	This is only the population that has been recorded due to old age.
358000	361000	In fact, the number will be higher.
361000	374000	Psychological health has many social factors.
374000	380000	What is the relationship between the building environment and psychological health?
380000	384000	I can think of it in three directions.
384000	391000	The first one is that we can imagine that the sun's exposure to the sun is related to our physical and mental health.
391000	394000	This will affect our mood.
394000	396000	In terms of environmental vision,
396000	401000	people may look out of the window and see what the street scene is.
401000	406000	Or the environment gives you a feeling of pressure or a sense of pressure.
406000	410000	This will also cause us to have different reactions psychologically.
410000	419000	The third point is that the urban structure of our society is closely related to our social interactions.
419000	424000	Let me give you a simple example of my grandmother's house.
424000	428000	My grandmother's house is a fishing village in the south of Taiwan.
429000	434000	The main urban design of this fishing village is like this.
434000	440000	There is a series of residential areas around the main provincial highway.
440000	442000	This residential area is a large area.
442000	445000	The connection in the middle of this large area is a small alley.
445000	451000	The distance between each small alley is about five meters.
451000	453000	In other words, the car can't get in.
454000	458000	There are two main types of houses in this residential area.
458000	459000	One is a three-room house.
459000	463000	The other is a Milan-style building with about four or five floors.
463000	468000	The function of this three-room house in the residential area is that
468000	474000	there is an underground water drain in the middle of the three-room house.
474000	480000	So everyone goes to that place to chat and get water.
481000	484000	Every time I go back to my grandmother's house,
484000	494000	I can often hear that everyone is quarreling in the alley or in the three-room house.
494000	496000	But no, they are just chatting.
496000	503000	In another era, when my grandmother's children grew up and lived in the city,
503000	507000	some of them moved to Kaohsiung City and moved to Taitung City.
507000	511000	For example, my father moved to a community building in Taitung City.
511000	516000	In this community building, their lifestyle became that
516000	523000	when my father got home, he parked his car and went straight to the 11th floor of the elevator to the apartment.
523000	527000	Through the legend of the elevator in this apartment,
527000	532000	he was actually in the same building as his neighbor.
532000	536000	Maybe there was only a wall or a floor area.
536000	544000	But even so, it almost completely avoided the possibility of communication with those neighbors.
544000	547000	So what is the lifestyle of our residents?
547000	552000	It will also affect the way we interact with our neighbors around us.
556000	561000	In the past, the study of what kind of urban lifestyle is related to mental health
561000	566000	is actually a more abstract or simplified way of understanding it.
566000	571000	It regards urban and rural as a spectrum of urban and rural.
571000	574000	In this spectrum, they are usually divided into two groups,
574000	576000	that is, urban people and rural people.
576000	582000	In these two groups, they conduct a lot of research,
582000	586000	including in Africa or other European countries, as well as the United States.
586000	589000	This study is a comprehensive study.
589000	592000	It collects data from dozens of European and American countries.
592000	595000	It turns out that in general, in these countries,
595000	601000	the ratio of depression and anxiety,
601000	603000	that is, the ratio of population infection,
603000	608000	is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
609000	617000	In the context of globalization and the constant increase of urban population,
617000	620000	it is almost impossible to say that
620000	623000	it is because living in a rural area is healthier,
623000	626000	so we try to encourage everyone to live in a rural area.
626000	630000	For me, there is a very interesting question here,
630000	635000	that is, in urban environments,
635000	642000	what kind of urban design and urban planning
642000	646000	can be psychological health?
646000	649000	This is my main research motivation.
652000	654000	Let me introduce it to you.
654000	656000	When I was doing this research,
656000	658000	in fact, there were already a lot of predecessors,
658000	660000	that is, the previous researchers,
660000	663000	who had already thought a lot about this issue.
663000	664000	But in the study method,
664000	667000	the past research is more limited to small-scale research,
667000	670000	because they need to go through, for example, questionnaire survey,
670000	675000	to understand what the living environment
675000	678000	of their subjects is like.
678000	681000	Because psychological health is a very complicated issue,
681000	683000	compared to other areas,
683000	688000	such as work, career, family life, etc.
688000	693000	Therefore, when it comes to the living environment,
693000	695000	in many cases,
695000	698000	if the sample is small,
698000	701000	it will be more limited to research.
701000	705000	Therefore, one of the main breakthroughs in my PhD program
705000	709000	is how we can use satellite images and big data
709000	714000	to achieve a large-scale environmental feature,
714000	718000	and then connect such large-scale spatial information
718000	720000	with health information storage,
720000	722000	that is, the entire population of Denmark.
725000	726000	Let me show you
726000	730000	what the satellite image I am currently using looks like.
733000	735000	This image is Landsat,
735000	737000	a satellite from NASA.
737000	741000	It is summarized in series from Landsat 5 to Landsat 8,
741000	743000	from 1984 to the present.
743000	746000	It took 16 days to take this image,
746000	749000	so you can see what the image is like.
752000	757000	This image has an obvious problem
757000	760000	when it is recognized in the form of a story.
760000	764000	You can see the comparison of these two images here.
764000	767000	The one on the left is Google Earth,
767000	772000	a high-resolution satellite image.
772000	774000	The one on the right is the same one.
775000	777000	It is more clear because it is placed further away,
777000	779000	but if we look at it closely,
779000	782000	you will find that it is blurry
782000	786000	like a mosaic.
786000	789000	It's hard to really see
789000	791000	which side is the tall building, which side is the low building,
791000	792000	which side is the crowded residential area,
792000	795000	and which side is the windshield.
796000	800000	If you want to use a satellite image
800000	803000	to understand the entire city's
803000	806000	shape, structure, and health,
806000	808000	in my thesis,
808000	810000	the first part of the problem to be solved is
810000	813000	how do we use artificial intelligence,
813000	815000	especially the power of learning,
815000	818000	to solve the limitation of the satellite image.
819000	821000	The second part is that
821000	824000	when we make a breakthrough in methodology,
824000	827000	and get large-scale spatial information,
827000	831000	how do we connect it with the satellite image?
835000	838000	The first part of the study will be
838000	841000	the first half of the study.
841000	842000	I will let you ask questions first
842000	844000	when the first half of the study is over.
850000	852000	The first part is mainly about
852000	855000	when we get a satellite image,
855000	857000	like this picture on the left,
857000	859000	we hope to convert this satellite image
859000	861000	through machine learning
861000	864000	into the spatial information on the right.
864000	866000	Spatial information includes
866000	869000	which parts of the image
869000	872000	belong to the tall building,
872000	874000	the low building,
874000	877000	the crowded residential area, and so on.
877000	879000	In this study,
879000	881000	we will use the image of
881000	883000	the limited landsat
883000	885000	to compare different methods of
885000	887000	machine learning and deep learning,
887000	889000	to see which method
889000	892000	has more advantages in this topic.
893000	895000	Then we will see that
895000	897000	if this method can be trained well
897000	899000	in the Danube case,
899000	901000	can it be applied to other places
901000	904000	and have more potential for expansion?
904000	907000	First of all, this is the framework of our classification.
907000	909000	As mentioned earlier,
909000	913000	in terms of urban density,
913000	916000	it is a concept of gradient.
916000	918000	It will be divided into low density,
918000	920000	medium density, and high density.
920000	922000	In terms of building height,
922000	924000	this is a system designed
924000	926000	for the Danube context.
926000	928000	There are not many tall buildings in the Danube,
928000	930000	so you can imagine that
930000	932000	it is a system of building height
932000	934000	below the third floor.
934000	936000	Above the third floor,
936000	938000	we call it an apartment
938000	940000	or an open space.
948000	950000	This is an overview of
950000	952000	the entire research framework.
952000	954000	In the upper left corner,
954000	956000	you can see that
956000	958000	this is the satellite image
958000	960000	we use,
960000	962000	which has been integrated
962000	964000	from 1985 to 2018.
964000	966000	There is an image that
966000	968000	has not been affected by the cloud.
968000	970000	After obtaining this image,
970000	972000	we need to
972000	974000	let this model
974000	976000	learn something.
976000	978000	We need to give it some training data.
978000	980000	This training data
980000	982000	comes from Guangda.
982000	984000	Guangda is simply
984000	986000	a laser pulse.
986000	988000	When it hits an object,
988000	990000	there is a time difference.
990000	992000	This time difference can measure the shape of the object.
992000	994000	Therefore,
994000	996000	this data is a 3D model
996000	998000	of the entire Danube.
998000	1000000	We divide this 3D model
1000000	1002000	into two parts.
1002000	1004000	One is training data,
1004000	1006000	and the other is verification data.
1008000	1010000	In terms of models,
1010000	1012000	we have three models.
1012000	1014000	The following is a common
1014000	1016000	method of learning
1016000	1018000	deep learning.
1018000	1020000	It is not deep learning,
1020000	1022000	but its computing speed is relatively fast.
1022000	1024000	The two models above
1024000	1026000	are deep learning models.
1026000	1028000	Let's talk about the middle one first.
1028000	1030000	It is actually the simplest
1030000	1032000	rotating machine model.
1032000	1034000	You often hear of CNA.
1036000	1038000	The one above
1038000	1040000	is a little more complicated than the one below.
1040000	1042000	But its base is the same.
1042000	1044000	It also comes from a
1044000	1046000	3D model.
1046000	1048000	In the model design,
1048000	1050000	there is a pooling layer
1050000	1052000	in the middle.
1052000	1054000	To put it simply,
1054000	1056000	what it is doing
1056000	1058000	is to
1058000	1060000	increase the speed of the machine.
1060000	1062000	But what is it?
1062000	1064000	I would like to introduce it to you now.
1064000	1066000	As mentioned earlier,
1066000	1068000	when we use high-resolution
1068000	1070000	commercial satellites,
1070000	1072000	we can clearly see
1072000	1074000	the same structure
1074000	1076000	and different architectural forms.
1076000	1078000	But the same range
1078000	1080000	is completely different.
1080000	1082000	In the same range,
1082000	1084000	it is difficult to see
1084000	1086000	which side is the high-rise
1086000	1088000	and which side is the flat.
1088000	1090000	But if we can
1090000	1092000	consider the information
1092000	1094000	of the multi-level building,
1094000	1096000	it will be a little different.
1096000	1098000	For example,
1098000	1100000	in this block of the high-rise,
1100000	1102000	there are three long
1104000	1106000	pixels.
1106000	1108000	The reason why the pixels are darker
1108000	1110000	is because there are more
1110000	1112000	buildings in this area.
1112000	1114000	If we look further,
1114000	1116000	we can see
1116000	1118000	that
1118000	1120000	the design of
1120000	1122000	this new community
1122000	1124000	is more
1124000	1126000	urbanized.
1126000	1128000	For example,
1128000	1130000	the buildings in this area
1130000	1132000	are more organic
1132000	1134000	and more deformed.
1134000	1136000	So,
1136000	1138000	on a larger scale,
1138000	1140000	we can see that
1140000	1142000	the structure can help us
1142000	1144000	distinguish which side is the high-rise
1144000	1146000	and which side is the flat.
1148000	1150000	When we have trained
1150000	1152000	these models and data,
1152000	1154000	we will use
1154000	1156000	the verification data
1156000	1158000	to verify the performance of the model.
1158000	1160000	What I want to mention here is that
1160000	1162000	the year of verification
1162000	1164000	data is different
1164000	1166000	from the year of training data.
1166000	1168000	For example, our training data is 2014,
1168000	1170000	but when we verify it,
1170000	1172000	we want to know
1172000	1174000	whether the model
1174000	1176000	that has been trained
1176000	1178000	recently can be used
1178000	1180000	to draw a historical urban model.
1180000	1182000	So, we found data from
1182000	1184000	2006 and 1995
1184000	1186000	that can be used
1186000	1188000	to draw a historical urban model.
1190000	1192000	Here is the research result.
1192000	1194000	I want to introduce
1194000	1196000	the six types of urban models
1196000	1198000	in Denmark.
1200000	1202000	The first one is the high-rise
1202000	1204000	with high density.
1204000	1206000	The high-density apartment buildings
1206000	1208000	are mainly located in the city center.
1208000	1210000	Here, we found two big cities
1210000	1212000	in Denmark,
1212000	1214000	Denmark and
1214000	1216000	Denmark.
1216000	1218000	In this picture,
1218000	1220000	the high-density apartment buildings
1220000	1222000	are represented as one group in immigrant
1222000	1224000	communities,
1224000	1226000	the rest areas are
1226000	1228000	isolated to the city center
1228000	1230000	as one group.
1232000	1234000	In this picture,
1234000	1236000	the high-density apartment buildings
1236000	1238000	are represented as one group
1238000	1240000	in immigrant communities,
1240000	1242000	the rest areas are isolated
1242000	1244000	as one group.
1244000	1246000	The third and fourth
1246000	1248000	sheets of yellow
1248000	1250000	architectural formula
1250000	1252000	symbolize Denmark's
1252000	1254000	major residential system.
1254000	1256000	Republican apartments
1256000	1258000	are simply
1258000	1260000	high-density
1260000	1262000	built in contact
1262000	1264000	with neighborhood
1264000	1266000	between city centers
1266000	1268000	and settlements.
1268000	1270000	As you can see,
1270000	1272000	the yellow part
1272000	1274000	of the low-density
1274000	1276000	apartment
1276000	1278000	is all
1278000	1280000	high-density.
1280000	1282000	You can imagine
1282000	1284000	this type of apartment
1284000	1286000	as a house in Europe
1286000	1288000	with lots of greenery
1288000	1290000	around it.
1290000	1292000	What is a low-density
1292000	1294000	high-density apartment like?
1294000	1296000	This type of apartment
1296000	1298000	can be located
1298000	1300000	on the outskirts
1300000	1302000	of the city
1302000	1304000	or around the park
1304000	1306000	and next to the river
1306000	1308000	to the first row of water.
1308000	1310000	It is a high-density apartment.
1310000	1312000	The low-density
1312000	1314000	low-rise apartment
1314000	1316000	is a low-density
1316000	1318000	high-density apartment.
1320000	1322000	We found that
1322000	1324000	in the case of Denmark,
1324000	1326000	the low-density
1326000	1328000	low-rise apartment
1328000	1330000	is more
1330000	1332000	common than
1332000	1334000	the high-density
1334000	1336000	high-density apartment.

2030000	2032000	The lower-density

2034000	2036000	is more common

2054000	2056000	lower-density apartment
2056000	2058000	on the same floor.
2058000	2060000	The Lower and Upper
2060000	2062000	Dependency Parking
2062000	2064000	is more common
2064000	2066000	than
2066000	2068000	the lower-density
2068000	2070000	lower-density apartment
2070000	2072000	on the same floor.
2072000	2074000	The Lower and Upper
2074000	2076000	Dependency Parking
2076000	2078000	is more common

2082000	2084000	lower-density apartment
2084000	2086000	on the same floor.
2086000	2088000	In other words,
2088000	2090000	relative to
2090000	2092000	the lower-density
2092000	2094000	apartment on the same floor,
2094000	2096000	the dwelling environment
2096000	2098000	in the lower-density
2098000	2100000	apartment
2100000	2102000	in the lower-density
2102000	2104000	lower-density apartment
2104000	2106000	is not as positive
2106000	2108000	as the higher-density
2108000	2110000	living environment
2110000	2112000	in the lower-density
2112000	2114000	lower-density
2114000	2116000	low-density
2116000	2118000	and relative to
2118000	2120000	the upper-density
2120000	2122000	middle-density
2122000	2124000	middle-density
2124000	2126000	low-density

2132000	2134000	middle-density
2134000	2136000	middle-density
2137000	2139000	As you can see
2139000	2141000	When we go from
2141000	2143000	yellow to red
2143000	2145000	It is gradually
2145000	2147000	more and more modulation
2147000	2149000	For example,
2149000	2151000	this high-density IR
2151000	2153000	In the original right of this curve
2153000	2155000	Its risk relative to
2155000	2157000	the lower-density is relatively high
2157000	2159000	However, when it controls the modulation
2159000	2161000	Its risk
2161000	2163000	is relatively reduced
2163000	2165000	In other words,
2165000	2167000	the high-density IR
2167000	2169000	can be controlled by
2169000	2171000	other social mechanisms
2171000	2173000	However, even if it is excluded
2173000	2175000	Its risk is about 1.4 times
2175000	2177000	higher than
2177000	2179000	the low-density IR
2179000	2181000	in rural areas
2183000	2185000	On the other hand
2185000	2187000	What is more interesting is that
2187000	2189000	we originally expected that
2189000	2191000	rural areas would have the lowest risk
2191000	2193000	However, in the case of depression
2193000	2195000	As you can see
2195000	2197000	The lower-density IR
2197000	2199000	is relatively low
2199000	2201000	Its risk is actually
2201000	2203000	lower than that of rural areas
2203000	2205000	In other words, although it is in the urban area
2205000	2207000	But in this architectural state
2207000	2209000	Its risk is actually
2209000	2211000	not higher than that of rural areas
2217000	2219000	We just
2219000	2221000	found the risk-benefit relationship
2221000	2223000	We present its spatial state
2223000	2225000	on the map of Denmark
2225000	2227000	and
2227000	2229000	the three main cities of Denmark
2229000	2231000	including Copenhagen
2231000	2233000	Aarhus
2233000	2235000	and Corpus
2235000	2237000	It also produces
2237000	2239000	an interesting pattern
2239000	2241000	In the original
2241000	2243000	we expected that
2243000	2245000	rural areas should be pink
2245000	2247000	Everyone is happier
2247000	2249000	The risk is relatively low
2249000	2251000	As you can see
2251000	2253000	Not only rural areas are pink
2253000	2255000	The city center of the city is also pink
2255000	2257000	Especially in the city center
2257000	2259000	On the port side
2259000	2261000	on the river bank
2261000	2263000	and some green areas
2263000	2265000	are the areas with the lowest risk
2267000	2269000	Which area is the area with the highest risk?
2269000	2271000	It is not in the center of the city
2271000	2273000	Instead, it is in
2273000	2275000	the suburbs
2275000	2277000	Especially
2277000	2279000	the areas with more walls
2279000	2281000	It is relatively
2281000	2283000	the area with the highest risk
2287000	2289000	So I want to go back
2289000	2291000	to the first question
2291000	2293000	of today
2293000	2295000	What is a more sustainable
2295000	2297000	urban mentality?
2297000	2299000	According to our research
2299000	2301000	on mental health
2301000	2303000	In fact, we found that
2303000	2305000	there is no
2305000	2307000	linear relationship
2307000	2309000	The higher the density, the better
2309000	2311000	or the lower the density, the better
2313000	2315000	We found that
2315000	2317000	it is a combination
2317000	2319000	of low density
2319000	2321000	and high density
2321000	2323000	In the case of Denmark
2323000	2325000	we found that
2325000	2327000	the risk is relatively low
2327000	2329000	It is like
2329000	2331000	a neighborhood in Denmark
2331000	2333000	So you can see
2333000	2335000	In this area
2335000	2337000	for the residents
2337000	2339000	it is relatively easy to access
2339000	2341000	public facilities
2341000	2343000	including commercial activities
2343000	2345000	such as coffee shops
2345000	2347000	It is also easy to have rest areas
2347000	2349000	such as parks
2351000	2353000	In comparison
2353000	2355000	In Denmark
2355000	2357000	these high density
2357000	2359000	low-rise
2359000	2361000	high-density flat areas
2361000	2363000	When the industrial development of Denmark
2363000	2365000	reached its peak in the 1970s
2365000	2367000	At that time, because of the huge population
2367000	2369000	many houses
2369000	2371000	were built outside the city
2371000	2373000	When they built
2373000	2375000	the design
2375000	2377000	the density
2377000	2379000	of the population was very high
2379000	2381000	but there were no corresponding
2381000	2383000	commercial activities or public facilities
2387000	2389000	In our research
2389000	2391000	we found
2391000	2393000	that
2393000	2395000	in the case of
2395000	2397000	moving houses
2397000	2399000	If the residents
2399000	2401000	moved to
2401000	2403000	high density flat areas
2407000	2409000	If the residents
2409000	2411000	live in such an environment
2411000	2413000	there will be a risk increase
2413000	2415000	In other words
2415000	2417000	compared to the residents
2417000	2419000	of high density flat areas
2419000	2421000	If the residents
2421000	2423000	moved to
2423000	2425000	high density flat areas
2425000	2427000	they will face
2427000	2429000	a higher risk
2429000	2431000	So
2431000	2433000	we are talking about
2433000	2435000	environmental justice
2435000	2437000	or social justice
2437000	2439000	In Denmark
2439000	2441000	there have been a lot of
2441000	2443000	urban renewal cases
2443000	2445000	In the process of urban renewal
2445000	2447000	the city retained
2447000	2449000	or increased the urban green space
2449000	2451000	and improved the quality of life
2451000	2453000	At the same time
2453000	2455000	it also increased the rent in the city center
2455000	2457000	In the past
2457000	2459000	the city center of Denmark
2459000	2461000	was mainly for the workers
2461000	2463000	After these places
2463000	2465000	were upgraded
2465000	2467000	when the rent became more expensive
2467000	2469000	some people
2469000	2471000	had to move to
2471000	2473000	lower rents
2473000	2475000	At the same time
2475000	2477000	the city council
2477000	2479000	contributed a lot
2479000	2481000	in this study
2481000	2483000	This is a problem
2483000	2485000	that needs to be noticed
2485000	2487000	in urban planning
2487000	2489000	so that we can provide
2489000	2491000	a more fair
2491000	2493000	and comfortable
2493000	2495000	living environment
2499000	2501000	Finally
2501000	2503000	I would like to summarize
2503000	2505000	the position of this study
2505000	2507000	in academic research
2507000	2509000	First of all
2509000	2511000	in the past
2511000	2513000	the researchers
2513000	2515000	mainly looked at the expansion
2515000	2517000	of the city
2517000	2519000	and simplified it
2519000	2521000	into a concept of
2521000	2523000	dual contrast
2523000	2525000	But
2525000	2527000	in addition to
2527000	2529000	the expansion of
2529000	2531000	if we can
2531000	2533000	look at some
2533000	2535000	urban design conditions in more detail
2535000	2537000	such as density and height
2537000	2539000	we will have a chance
2539000	2541000	to talk more
2541000	2543000	in the field of urban planning
2543000	2545000	and talk more about
2545000	2547000	psychological health
2547000	2549000	and other research
2549000	2551000	related to the extension
2551000	2553000	In the second part
2553000	2555000	the position of this study
2555000	2557000	is to use a global
2557000	2559000	method to conduct research
2559000	2561000	The advantage of global technology
2561000	2563000	is that when this method
2563000	2565000	is proposed
2565000	2567000	it can be applied to
2567000	2569000	many other countries
2569000	2571000	At the same time
2571000	2573000	it has a limitation
2573000	2575000	as mentioned earlier
2575000	2577000	because its coverage
2577000	2579000	is very large
2579000	2581000	and has a long history
2581000	2583000	so it is actually
2583000	2585000	a relatively limited
2585000	2587000	and difficult topic
2587000	2589000	Therefore, through
2589000	2591000	in-depth study
2591000	2593000	we can make progress
2593000	2595000	on this topic
2595000	2597000	This topic is actually
2597000	2599000	very broad
2599000	2601000	It requires a lot of people
2601000	2603000	from different professional backgrounds
2603000	2605000	to join in, including psychology, urban planning
2605000	2607000	and epidemiology
2607000	2609000	So I look forward to
2609000	2611000	discussing more with you
2615000	2617000	Finally, I would like to
2617000	2619000	briefly share
2619000	2621000	my next plan
2621000	2623000	I have a fellowship
2623000	2625000	in Yale in the next two years
2625000	2627000	My plan is
2627000	2629000	to expand
2629000	2631000	the three-dimensional
2631000	2633000	urban characteristics
2633000	2635000	I just mentioned
2635000	2637000	to the global research area
2637000	2639000	Under this global research
2639000	2641000	it is not just
2641000	2643000	the past
2643000	2645000	urban research
2645000	2647000	Most of the research areas
2647000	2649000	in Yale
2649000	2651000	are in large cities
2651000	2653000	such as
2653000	2655000	5 million people
2655000	2657000	The scale of the city
2657000	2659000	will receive a lot of research attention
2659000	2661000	However, compared to Taiwan
2661000	2663000	when urban development
2663000	2665000	has reached its peak
2665000	2667000	our urban update
2667000	2669000	may be a street area
2669000	2671000	These small-scale changes
2671000	2673000	or small-scale urban developments
2673000	2675000	in other Latin American countries
2675000	2677000	or even in Africa
2677000	2679000	their urban expansion
2679000	2681000	tend to start
2681000	2683000	from a small change
2683000	2685000	These areas
2685000	2687000	are relatively small
2687000	2689000	and remote
2689000	2691000	so it is hard to be seen by satellites
2691000	2693000	Therefore, in the past
2693000	2695000	we did not do much research
2695000	2697000	However, in the future
2697000	2699000	we plan to
2699000	2701000	do more research
2701000	2703000	in this area
2703000	2705000	This is a brief
2705000	2707000	reference
2707000	2709000	for you
2709000	2711000	If you are interested
2711000	2713000	you can read the articles
2713000	2715000	for more details
2717000	2719000	That's all for today
2719000	2721000	Let's start the discussion
2721000	2723000	Thank you, Chi-Hsing
2723000	2725000	If there are
2725000	2727000	any questions
2727000	2729000	please feel free
2729000	2731000	to raise your mic
2731000	2733000	to join the discussion
2733000	2735000	At the first stage
2735000	2737000	there was a question
2737000	2739000	from Xu Shi-Che
2739000	2741000	Do you want to
2741000	2743000	raise your mic
2743000	2745000	to ask Chi-Hsing?
2751000	2753000	Okay
2753000	2755000	Xu Shi-Che
2755000	2757000	seems to say
2757000	2759000	his mic is not working
2759000	2761000	Let me ask him
2761000	2763000	his question
2763000	2765000	His question is
2765000	2767000	how much
2767000	2769000	overall accuracy
2769000	2771000	do you need
2771000	2773000	to be able to
2773000	2775000	distinguish
2775000	2777000	your urban
2777000	2779000	development
2779000	2781000	between 6 types of urban
2781000	2783000	and 2 types of urban
2783000	2785000	This is a question
2785000	2787000	from the first stage
2789000	2791000	That's a good question
2791000	2793000	Because
2793000	2795000	overall accuracy
2795000	2797000	is hard to
2797000	2799000	distinguish
2799000	2801000	Overall accuracy
2801000	2803000	is easy to be
2803000	2805000	distinguished
2805000	2807000	by one type
2807000	2809000	We need to
2809000	2811000	look at
2811000	2813000	accuracy matrix
2813000	2815000	In this matrix
2815000	2817000	we can see
2817000	2819000	the top 3 are
2819000	2821000	horizontal
2821000	2823000	and the bottom 3
2823000	2825000	are vertical
2825000	2827000	and horizontal
2827000	2829000	When we
2829000	2831000	look at this
2831000	2833000	we need to
2833000	2835000	look at
2835000	2837000	our own performance
2837000	2839000	When each performance
2839000	2841000	can reach
2841000	2843000	60, 70, 80%
2843000	2845000	then we can
2845000	2847000	distinguish
2847000	2849000	Of course 60% is not good
2849000	2851000	But for now
2851000	2853000	we need to be able to
2853000	2855000	distinguish low density
2855000	2857000	houses from
2857000	2859000	non-houses
2859000	2861000	It is relatively difficult
2861000	2863000	When we see
2863000	2865000	our own performance
2865000	2867000	we can know
2867000	2869000	how to improve
2869000	2871000	our performance
2877000	2879000	Any other questions?
2881000	2883000	Hello
2883000	2885000	I have a question
2885000	2887000	about
2887000	2889000	Thank you for your speech
2889000	2891000	I think it is very interesting
2891000	2893000	My question is
2895000	2897000	You found that
2897000	2899000	urban conditions
2899000	2901000	are related to
2901000	2903000	residents'
2903000	2905000	mental health
2905000	2907000	Although it is not a simple
2907000	2909000	linear relationship
2909000	2911000	I am curious
2911000	2913000	At the beginning
2913000	2915000	you mentioned some
2915000	2917000	possible connections
2917000	2919000	For example,
2919000	2921000	we can have
2921000	2923000	social activities
2923000	2925000	so that people can
2925000	2927000	get along better
2927000	2929000	But you did not
2929000	2931000	measure it
2931000	2933000	So I am curious
2933000	2935000	What is your
2935000	2937000	imagination
2937000	2939000	about this mechanism
2939000	2941000	Do you have any
2941000	2943000	future research
2943000	2945000	to measure it?
2945000	2947000	I think
2947000	2949000	this question
2949000	2951000	I always
2951000	2953000	hear my own answer
2953000	2955000	I turn off
2955000	2957000	my microphone
2957000	2959000	Thank you
2959000	2961000	In fact, I think
2961000	2963000	when we do quantitative research
2963000	2965000	large scale
2965000	2967000	or big data research
2967000	2969000	we often encounter a limitation
2969000	2971000	that when we talk about
2971000	2973000	this mechanism
2973000	2975000	we can not measure it
2975000	2977000	So when we discuss
2977000	2979000	For example, when we see
2979000	2981000	that Denmark's
2981000	2983000	high-rise buildings are
2983000	2985000	in a low-risk state
2985000	2987000	we will look for
2987000	2989000	documents
2989000	2991000	through interviews
2991000	2993000	or through
2993000	2995000	small scale research
2995000	2997000	to discuss and respond
2997000	2999000	to the document
2999000	3001000	However,
3001000	3003000	in my research, I did not
3003000	3005000	measure it
3005000	3007000	In the future,
3007000	3009000	is it possible to
3009000	3011000	directly measure social interaction?
3011000	3013000	At present,
3013000	3015000	I see a chance
3015000	3017000	to use social media
3017000	3019000	such as Facebook
3019000	3021000	or Twitter
3021000	3023000	to make improvements
3023000	3025000	in this area
3025000	3027000	I am also curious
3027000	3029000	Do you have any ideas
3029000	3031000	or suggestions
3031000	3033000	I
3033000	3035000	I
3035000	3037000	I have no special
3037000	3039000	I just want to hear
3039000	3041000	your expert opinion
3041000	3043000	Because I am also quite interested
3043000	3045000	to know if you want to measure
3045000	3047000	what are the possibilities
3047000	3049000	But I do not know
3049000	3051000	how to do it
3053000	3055000	Hello
3055000	3057000	I am also doing
3057000	3059000	urban environment and psychological
3059000	3061000	research
3061000	3063000	But I am doing
3063000	3065000	green space
3065000	3067000	We will
3067000	3069000	Some say
3069000	3071000	because there is a
3071000	3073000	public space
3073000	3075000	so people will gather
3075000	3077000	and there will be some social interaction
3077000	3079000	There will be
3079000	3081000	social well-being
3081000	3083000	About this
3083000	3085000	public space
3085000	3087000	I have a question
3087000	3089000	In our research
3089000	3091000	it will affect
3091000	3093000	mental health
3093000	3095000	I want to ask
3095000	3097000	In your future research project
3097000	3099000	will you
3099000	3101000	turn green space
3101000	3103000	into your
3103000	3105000	control variables?
3109000	3111000	In Denmark,
3111000	3113000	the whole Northern Europe
3113000	3115000	pays a lot of attention to green space
3115000	3117000	I have a research
3117000	3119000	It is not my research
3119000	3121000	but there is a research in our team
3121000	3123000	It found that in Denmark
3123000	3125000	it uses a standard
3125000	3127000	NDE
3127000	3129000	It is from satellite image data
3129000	3131000	to see
3131000	3133000	when children
3133000	3135000	in their childhood
3135000	3137000	How high is the green space
3137000	3139000	for them to adults
3139000	3141000	will extend
3141000	3143000	different psychological
3143000	3145000	I found
3145000	3147000	green space is helpful
3149000	3151000	In my own research
3151000	3153000	Green space
3153000	3155000	is a hot topic
3155000	3157000	for psychological research
3157000	3159000	My next
3159000	3161000	research
3161000	3163000	I will talk about
3163000	3165000	cement
3165000	3167000	architecture
3167000	3169000	and then
3169000	3171000	cross analysis
3171000	3173000	When they are
3173000	3175000	what combination
3175000	3177000	they will do
3177000	3179000	effect analysis
3185000	3187000	Hello, I am Zhang Anping
3187000	3189000	Sorry, you just asked me
3189000	3191000	I thought about it
3191000	3193000	I am now
3193000	3195000	You listen to this thing
3195000	3197000	How likely
3197000	3199000	If we use
3199000	3201000	You see
3201000	3203000	Google map
3203000	3205000	Timeline
3205000	3207000	GPS location
3207000	3209000	plus
3209000	3211000	Wi-Fi location
3211000	3213000	to infer
3213000	3215000	a person's behavior
3215000	3217000	I am driving
3217000	3219000	I am walking
3219000	3221000	I am riding a bicycle
3221000	3223000	I am running
3223000	3225000	We can infer
3225000	3227000	a person's behavior
3227000	3229000	not on the timeline
3233000	3235000	But for the neighbor
3239000	3241000	He comes in
3241000	3243000	Quite close
3245000	3247000	Walking distance
3249000	3251000	This is a kind of confusion
3251000	3253000	Use that way
3253000	3255000	same as
3255000	3257000	Satellite system
3257000	3259000	Data
3259000	3261000	To model
3261000	3263000	Or at least to index
3263000	3265000	Different people
3265000	3267000	The difference in their behavior
3267000	3269000	Then put this as
3269000	3271000	To label them
3271000	3273000	Become a link
3273000	3275000	Urban design
3275000	3277000	Mental health or other
3277000	3279000	Well-being index
3279000	3281000	Link
3281000	3283000	Possibility
3285000	3287000	I think it sounds very interesting
3287000	3289000	If you can really get
3289000	3291000	For example, Google is willing to study
3291000	3293000	File and then apply
3293000	3295000	Get these users
3295000	3297000	The way you just talked about
3297000	3299000	Is it very
3299000	3301000	Can break through the current
3301000	3303000	I don't know what everyone is doing in this area
3303000	3305000	Discussion
3305000	3307000	Is that we can really predict
3307000	3309000	Some activities and then put the activity
3309000	3311000	What kind of space provides what kind of activity
3311000	3313000	Then enter the mental health
3313000	3315000	Can talk about this
3317000	3319000	Hello
3321000	3323000	Yes, I heard that I want to respond
3323000	3325000	Just now Zhang Yanping and
3325000	3327000	Your research is
3327000	3329000	Mainly this information privacy
3329000	3331000	Problem
3331000	3333000	Because you said before
3333000	3335000	The Danish Health Insurance Bureau's database
3335000	3337000	So it can reflect
3337000	3339000	Someone's
3339000	3341000	His illness and residence
3341000	3343000	A timeline
3343000	3345000	I think this
3345000	3347000	The feeling of privacy is very
3347000	3349000	Very high
3349000	3351000	Then you mentioned later
3351000	3353000	You also mentioned in the middle
3353000	3355000	There is positive
3355000	3357000	Force to move
3357000	3359000	I don't know how you know
3359000	3361000	He is
3361000	3363000	In what situation
3363000	3365000	This is also a personal
3365000	3367000	Privacy information
3367000	3369000	You mentioned that you want to put this research
3369000	3371000	To other areas in Denmark
3371000	3373000	For example, you are in the United States now
3373000	3375000	Then you feel
3375000	3377000	Denmark you get this database
3377000	3379000	The completeness of this information
3379000	3381000	Those in the United States
3381000	3383000	Or in other countries
3383000	3385000	Can you get it
3385000	3387000	Because it feels very private
3387000	3389000	Personal
3389000	3391000	Back to the example of Zhang Yanping
3391000	3393000	That is
3393000	3395000	Personal
3395000	3397000	Personal activity
3397000	3399000	But you still have his
3399000	3401000	Information about illness
3403000	3405000	Research in this area
3409000	3411000	The question you asked is very important
3411000	3413000	Is privacy
3413000	3415000	I can share with you
3415000	3417000	Denmark
3417000	3419000	Denmark
3419000	3421000	Their Bureau of Statistics
3421000	3423000	How do they go
3423000	3425000	To ensure that researchers
3425000	3427000	Do not hurt
3427000	3429000	Privacy
3429000	3431000	The first one is

3509000	3511000	can you hear me?
3511000	3513000	can you hear me?
3513000	3515000	this works, thank you
3515000	3517000	this works, thank you
3517000	3519000	sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network
3519000	3521000	sorry, I think I connected with the wrong network
3521000	3523000	I will continue with the
3523000	3525000	reply of the question
3525000	3527000	reply of the question
3531000	3533000	In Denmark
3533000	3535000	the statistics office
3535000	3537000	to use this data
3537000	3539000	first of all
3539000	3541000	this data is anonymous
3541000	3543000	and the people above
3543000	3545000	although we will see
3545000	3547000	there is an address code
3547000	3549000	but the address code is not an address
3549000	3551000	just a statistics office
3551000	3553000	behind to connect these
3553000	3555000	reading characteristics with their
3555000	3557000	social and economic attributes, it needs to have a code
3557000	3559000	to connect
3559000	3561000	when we researchers
3561000	3563000	see the data
3563000	3565000	they can't see
3565000	3567000	what the address looks like
3567000	3569000	we only see those that have been
3569000	3571000	linked
3571000	3573000	so above
3573000	3575000	we can't see who the person is
3575000	3577000	and we can't see the name of the address
3577000	3579000	or what the name is
3579000	3581000	so we
3581000	3583000	analyze
3583000	3585000	these variable combinations
3585000	3587000	and the statistics
3587000	3589000	and the statistics
3589000	3591000	and the statistics
3591000	3593000	and the statistics
3593000	3595000	and the statistics
3595000	3597000	but we can't take any
3597000	3599000	personal information
3599000	3601000	so in this way
3601000	3603000	we can only get a conclusion
3603000	3605000	but we can't
3605000	3607000	in this process
3607000	3609000	leak any personal information
3609000	3611000	what is it
3611000	3613000	the second one you just mentioned
3613000	3615000	how do I know
3615000	3617000	who is forced to move
3617000	3619000	and who wants to move
3619000	3621000	I don't know
3621000	3623000	in our research
3623000	3625000	we don't actually measure
3625000	3627000	this thing
3627000	3629000	when we respond to documents
3629000	3631000	especially Copenhagen
3631000	3633000	when we respond to documents
3633000	3635000	we find some documents
3635000	3637000	that have been interviewed
3637000	3639000	and they have targeted those
3639000	3641000	recent
3641000	3643000	because of Copenhagen
3643000	3645000	and the rent increase
3645000	3647000	including some of the meetings
3647000	3649000	and some of the records
3649000	3651000	and the records
3651000	3653000	and the results
3653000	3655000	and we
3655000	3657000	take this process
3657000	3659000	as a discussion
3659000	3661000	and put it in our research
3661000	3663000	and put it in our research
3663000	3665000	and the last question
3665000	3667000	is
3667000	3669000	this kind of research
3669000	3671000	is it possible to be studied in other countries
3671000	3673000	is it possible to be studied in other countries
3673000	3675000	in the US
3675000	3677000	I don't know much
3677000	3679000	about US security data
3679000	3681000	but I have some knowledge
3681000	3683000	about Taiwan security data
3683000	3685000	when it comes to Taiwan
3685000	3687000	security data
3687000	3689000	it is possible to study
3689000	3691000	psychological health
3691000	3693000	and we have ICD
3693000	3695000	so in our security data
3695000	3697000	every year
3697000	3699000	it takes a million people
3699000	3701000	to enter security data
3701000	3703000	and these people have their
3703000	3705000	ID
3705000	3707000	but in Taiwan
3707000	3709000	it is different
3709000	3711000	it is limited
3711000	3713000	in living address
3713000	3715000	currently in our security data
3715000	3717000	we can study
3717000	3719000	space information
3719000	3721000	the smallest unit is town
3721000	3723000	so we can only
3723000	3725000	study 360 towns
3725000	3727000	in Taiwan
3727000	3729000	but we can't study
3729000	3731000	250 square meters
3731000	3733000	this is what I know
3733000	3735000	do you have any question?
3739000	3741000	yes, thank you
3747000	3749000	I will ask
3749000	3751000	Xu Shizhe
3751000	3753000	about
3753000	3755000	accuracy
3755000	3757000	he said
3757000	3759000	from the picture
3759000	3761000	if we choose
3761000	3763000	deep lab
3763000	3765000	we will sacrifice
3765000	3767000	high accuracy
3767000	3769000	how to
3769000	3771000	overcome this problem?
3771000	3773000	this is Xu Shizhe
3773000	3775000	I have a question
3775000	3777000	about
3777000	3779000	your second part
3779000	3781000	I am curious
3781000	3783000	about the environment
3783000	3785000	will change
3785000	3787000	and the environment
3787000	3789000	how to
3789000	3791000	incorporate
3791000	3793000	these two
3793000	3795000	aspects
3795000	3797000	into your
3797000	3799000	logistic regression model?
3799000	3801000	this is my second question
3801000	3803000	thank you
3803000	3805000	I will answer
3805000	3807000	Xu Shizhe's question
3807000	3809000	indeed
3809000	3811000	when we look at
3811000	3813000	the picture
3813000	3815000	in the lower left
3815000	3817000	indeed
3817000	3819000	compared to
3819000	3821000	the other two models
3821000	3823000	the accuracy
3823000	3825000	is lower
3825000	3827000	when we
3827000	3829000	consider this
3829000	3831000	we will consider F1-score
3831000	3833000	simply speaking
3833000	3835000	F1-score needs to
3835000	3837000	measure
3837000	3839000	the balance
3839000	3841000	between different categories
3841000	3843000	if one category
3843000	3845000	is very high
3845000	3847000	the accuracy is very high
3847000	3849000	it means
3849000	3851000	if other categories are low
3851000	3853000	it means this category
3853000	3855000	is often overestimated
3855000	3857000	the model will
3857000	3859000	draw the whole map as tall buildings
3859000	3861000	so that all the tall buildings
3861000	3863000	can be measured
3863000	3865000	but not all of them
3865000	3867000	are tall buildings
3867000	3869000	so other buildings
3869000	3871000	are not drawn
3871000	3873000	the accuracy
3873000	3875000	of F1-score
3875000	3877000	should be
3877000	3879000	balanced
3879000	3881000	this is my first question
3881000	3883000	Gao Xian's question
3883000	3885000	is
3885000	3887000	the environment
3887000	3889000	has time and
3889000	3891000	historical changes
3891000	3893000	how to incorporate
3893000	3895000	these two aspects
3895000	3897000	into your research?
3897000	3899000	I have another
3899000	3901000	question
3905000	3907000	when we
3907000	3909000	track Danes'
3909000	3911000	moving records
3911000	3913000	or their
3913000	3915000	historical record
3915000	3917000	there are two factors
3917000	3919000	that affect their
3919000	3921000	environment
3921000	3923000	one is
3923000	3925000	moving
3925000	3927000	another is
3927000	3929000	in Danish data
3929000	3931000	the main environmental
3931000	3933000	changes are
3933000	3935000	from moving
3935000	3937000	not from
3937000	3939000	fast urban expansion
3939000	3941000	how to incorporate
3941000	3943000	this into
3943000	3945000	logistics?
3945000	3947000	in the
3947000	3949000	independent variable
3949000	3951000	that we added
3951000	3953000	in the last
3953000	3955000	five years
3955000	3957000	there is a
3957000	3959000	difference
3959000	3961000	between
3961000	3963000	last five years
3963000	3965000	and this year
3965000	3967000	this difference
3967000	3969000	is a variable
3969000	3971000	in our model
3971000	3973000	the result
3973000	3975000	is
3975000	3977000	these five
3977000	3979000	on the left
3979000	3981000	are not only
3981000	3983000	average
3983000	3985000	but also
3985000	3987000	high density
3987000	3989000	if
3989000	3991000	the change
3991000	3993000	is positive
3993000	3995000	it will
3995000	3997000	have a higher
3997000	3999000	contribution
3999000	4001000	Gao Xian
4001000	4003000	did I answer
4003000	4005000	your question?
4005000	4007000	Yes
4007000	4009000	I am curious
4009000	4011000	if you put them
4011000	4013000	in the model
4013000	4015000	will there be
4015000	4017000	a change
4017000	4019000	or covariance?
4019000	4021000	Yes, there may be
4021000	4023000	a contribution
4023000	4025000	for each model
4025000	4027000	there is a
4027000	4029000	PIF
4029000	4031000	the result is
4031000	4033000	less than 5
4033000	4035000	the contribution is not that obvious
4035000	4037000	I believe
4037000	4039000	there must be
4039000	4041000	a change
4041000	4043000	in the model
4043000	4045000	for each model
4045000	4047000	the result is
4047000	4049000	less than 5
4049000	4051000	the contribution is not that obvious
4051000	4053000	I believe
4053000	4055000	there must be
4055000	4057000	a change
4057000	4059000	in the model
4059000	4061000	for each model
4061000	4063000	the result is less than
4063000	4065000	5
4065000	4067000	the contribution is not that obvious
4067000	4069000	Any other questions?
4079000	4081000	I have no questions
4081000	4083000	Hi
4083000	4085000	My name is Qiao En
4085000	4087000	I am a clinical psychologist
4087000	4089000	I am interested
4089000	4091000	in urban planning
4091000	4093000	and psychology
4093000	4095000	I read a paper
4095000	4097000	about the different functions
4097000	4099000	of land use
4099000	4101000	for those who live in
4101000	4103000	urban areas
4103000	4105000	like Taiwan
4105000	4107000	there are 7 floors
4107000	4109000	1st floor for shops
4109000	4111000	2nd and 3rd floor for residents
4111000	4113000	in this case
4113000	4115000	people are more likely to
4115000	4117000	walk or ride bicycles
4117000	4119000	just like the student
4119000	4121000	who talked about
4121000	4123000	social behavior
4123000	4125000	for those who live in
4125000	4127000	urban areas
4127000	4129000	or high-rise
4129000	4131000	it is not easy
4131000	4133000	for them to walk
4133000	4135000	and be healthy
4135000	4137000	because they have to
4137000	4139000	drive everywhere
4139000	4141000	so I am thinking
4141000	4143000	maybe in the future
4143000	4145000	you can change this
4145000	4147000	to land use
4147000	4149000	is it related to
4149000	4151000	people's walking habits
4151000	4153000	yes
4153000	4155000	I think
4155000	4157000	it is a good direction
4157000	4159000	in the future
4159000	4161000	I am interested
4161000	4163000	in
4163000	4165000	specific
4165000	4167000	like what you said
4167000	4169000	would they
4169000	4171000	want to walk
4171000	4173000	or ride bicycles
